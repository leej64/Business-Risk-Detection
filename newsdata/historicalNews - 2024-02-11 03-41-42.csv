One reason being its ‘too big to fail’ aura which gives it the appearance of a strong and stable investment. However, the health of the financials determines whether the company continues to succeed. Today we will look at 3M’s financial liquidity and debt levels, which are strong indicators for whether the company can weather economic downturns or fund strategic acquisitions for future growth. Remember this is a very top-level look that focuses exclusively on financial health, so I recommend a deeper analysis into MMM here. View our latest analysis for 3MMMM’s debt levels surged from US$11.70B to US$14.01B over the last 12 months , which is made up of current and long term debt. With this increase in debt, MMM’s cash and short-term investments stands at US$4.13B , ready to deploy into the business. Additionally, MMM has produced US$6.24B in operating cash flow in the last twelve months, leading to an operating cash to total debt ratio of 44.54%, meaning that MMM’s operating cash is sufficient to cover its debt. This ratio can also be interpreted as a measure of efficiency as an alternative to return on assets. In MMM’s case, it is able to generate 0.45x cash from its debt capital.At the current liabilities level of US$7.69B liabilities, the company has been able to meet these commitments with a current assets level of US$14.28B, leading to a 1.86x current account ratio. Usually, for Industrials companies, this is a suitable ratio as there’s enough of a cash buffer without holding too capital in low return investments.3M is a highly levered company given that total debt exceeds equity. This isn’t surprising for large-caps, as equity can often be more expensive to issue than debt, plus interest payments are tax deductible. Consequently, larger-cap organisations tend to enjoy lower cost of capital as a result of easily attained financing, providing an advantage over smaller companies. No matter how high the company’s debt, if it can easily cover the interest payments, it’s considered to be efficient with its use of excess leverage. As a rule of thumb, a company should have earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of at least three times the size of net interest. For MMM, the ratio of 22.31x suggests that interest is amply covered. Large-cap investments like MMM are often believed to be a safe investment due to their ability to pump out ample earnings multiple times its interest payments.Although MMM’s debt level is towards the higher end of the spectrum, its cash flow coverage seems adequate to meet obligations which means its debt is being efficiently utilised. This may mean this is an optimal capital structure for the business, given that it is also meeting its short-term commitment. This is only a rough assessment of financial health, and I’m sure MMM has company-specific issues impacting its capital structure decisions.

These rewards, approved by the board of directors, have aided the company’s share price to gain 0.7% yesterday.We believe that such disbursements reflect 3M’s shareholder-friendly policies and strong cash position. Details of Share Buyback & Quarterly DividendUnder the new buyback program, 3M was allowed to repurchase shares of up to $10 billion. This program will replace the company’s existing share buyback programs.Additionally, the company declared that it has been authorized to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $1.36 per share to shareholders of record as of Nov 23. The payment, pertaining to the fourth quarter of 2018, will be made this year on Dec 12. Sound Capital-Allocation Strategies3M uses free resources for strengthening its growth prospects and rewarding shareholders through share buybacks, and dividend payments.Over the last five years (2013-2017), 3M’s annual dividend payments increased from $2.54 in 2013 to $4.70 in 2017. In the first three quarters of 2018, the company distributed a dividend of $4.08 per share. It’s worth noting here that the quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 16% in January 2018.Regarding share buybacks, the company repurchased $3.6 billion worth of shares in the first three quarters of 2018. It had $1.5 billion authorization left in its $10-billion buyback program approved in February 2016.For 2018, 3M anticipates repurchasing shares worth $4-$5 billion. Our TakeWe believe that improvement in profitability and strong cash position will enable 3M to return higher value to shareholders in the years ahead. In the third quarter of 2018, the company’s net income increased 8% year over year. Further, its cash and cash equivalents were $3,185 million exiting the period.For 2018, 3M now anticipates earnings of $9.90-$10.00 per share, with the mid-point reflecting year-over-year growth of 8.5%.

The state had sued the Company for $5 billion and alleged that drinking water in several east Twin Cities suburbs was contaminated due to disposal of perfluorochemicals (PFCs) over the last fifty plus years adversely impacting the health of people.

This morning, 3M most recent news is on our radar and our team decided to put out a fantastic report on the company that is now available for free below:www.active-investors.com/registration-sg/?symbol=MMM PFC's were used by 3M once to make Scotchgard fabric protector and other products. Research indicates that PFCs are linked to increased risks of cancer, thyroid disease, fertility issues, liver damage, and impacts on growth and learning in children. The settlement was announced by Lori Swanson, Minnesota's Attorney General (AG).Agreement between 3M and State of MinnesotaAs per the terms of the settlement between 3M and the State, both parties have agreed to work together and invest in environment and community. Accordingly, 3M has agreed to provide a $850 million grant to the State for a special fund called - ""3M Grant for Water Quality and Sustainability Fund"". This fund is expected to support water sustainability projects in the Twin Cities East Metro region. This could include projects related to the reduction of PFCs in the environment and to the enhancement of groundwater sustainability. The fund also plans to support projects which encourage and result in habitat and recreation improvements, such as fishing piers, trails, and open space preservation.The Company has also shared that the settlement and related legal fees will negatively impact Company's EPS for Q1 2018 by approximately $1.10 to $1.15 per share.Commenting on the matter, John Banovetz, Senior VP - Research & Development and CTO with 3M, said:""We are proud of our record of environmental stewardship, and while we do not believe there is a PFC-related public health issue, 3M will work with the State on these important projects. Sustainability is embedded firmly at the core of our business. This settlement reflects our commitment to acting with integrity and conducting business in a sustainable way that is in the best interest of all who live and work in Minnesota.""AG Swanson was pleased with the settlement and stated:""We think the settlement will help solve a problem for Minnesota. It's a problem that's been a long time in the making for many decades. These chemicals as I mentioned were put into the ground and we are very hopeful that this settlement can help fix that.""The LawsuitThe lawsuit against 3M was filed in 2010 for contamination of the fish and waterways in Minnesota and later morphed into a case of 3M being held responsible for causing health risks for the residents of the state, especially in the East Twin Cities Metro region.The AG alleged that the Company's use and disposal of petro-fluorochemicals (PFCs) since the 1950's had contaminated the water supplies in East Twin Cities Metro region leading to health problems for the people drinking the contaminated water. 3M owns the patent for PFCs and used them in the manufacture of products like Teflon brand non-stick cookware and Scotchguard stain repellants. The Company had been disposing these chemicals legally at different landfills in the Twin Cities suburbs of Oakdale, Woodbury and Lake Elmo till the 1970s. The Company stopped making PFCs in early 2000s. The AG believed that the Company continued disposing the chemicals with full knowledge that the groundwater could be contaminated with PFCs and would increase health hazards like cancer and infertility amongst the residents in the region. It is estimated that approximately 67,000 consumed the contaminated water in the affected area.Although 3M conceded that the presence of PFCs is widespread it claimed that they were harmless and only caused disease in laboratory animals in ""ultra-high concentrations"". The Company completely denied the AGs allegations that it was knowingly covering up the health risks of PFCs. The Company referred to a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) studies that show PFCs in someone's blood does not necessarily mean their health will be impacted.The case which has been delayed for a long time and was further delayed after a report by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) in February 07, 2018, said that drinking water contaminated by 3M apparently has not caused higher rates of cancer or low birth weights in parts of Washington County compared to the rest of the state. The case was headed for a jury selection of February 20, 2018, when in a dramatic turn, the Company announced the settlement with the State.This is not the end of the matter for 3M as it still faces similar lawsuits related to PFCs across the country.About 3M Co.St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M is a global science Company that never stops inventing. The Company has 46 technology platforms, ranging from adhesives and abrasives, to ceramics and nanotechnology. The Company has $30 billion in sales and offices across over 70 countries.
