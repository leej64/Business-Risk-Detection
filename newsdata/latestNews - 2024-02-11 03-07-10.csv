Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferré breaks down the latest action in the commodity markets.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Stephanie MikulichSEANA SMITH: Let's take a look at oil and gold, both on the move this morning. Lots of speculation about what exactly delayed rate cut is going to mean for these commodity trades. Ines Ferre, standing by at the big board-- the closer look at some of the downward pressure that we've seen on prices this morning. Ines.INES FERRE: Yeah, Seana. And we are seeing downward pressure on WTI and Brent Crude futures. I do want to point out the US dollar index, this is at a three-month high. So this is also causing pressure on commodities, which are invoiced in US dollars. So let's take a look at the board, where we're seeing WTI down about 8/10 of a percent. We're also watching Brent Crude, that is down about 6/10 of a percent.I'm going to pull up a six-day chart here, so you can see the decline that we also saw on Friday, as well. You do have those comments over the weekend from Jerome Powell, basically, saying that a rate cut in March is unlikely. So that is putting a pressure on commodities because if you cut rates, then economic activity goes up. And so, therefore, you would see demand for oil going up. So that's why we're seeing some of the pressure here with crude oil.You also do have the US that is pushing for a truce in Gaza. I also want to note that one analyst is saying that we haven't really seen much of a supply disruption despite what has been going on in the Middle East because US producers have been outputting a record amount of oil in the market. So we are seeing all of-- any tensions from the Middle East, what we have seen in the Red Sea, all of that is, basically, priced into oil right now.And then just following up with gold futures, we are seeing gold that is up about $2,033 per ounce. Analysts are expecting this to maintain above the $2,000 level. But, again, the US dollar index going up also putting pressure on gold, as well.

Gold Shines as the US Economy Slows`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-shines-us-economy-slows-102254701.html`2024-02-02 10:22:54`With the Federal Reserve (‘the Fed’) having signalled that a cut to the funds rate is unlikely next month, the slight majority of traders now expects a hold on 20 March according to CME FedWatch Tool.Instability in the Middle East and specifically the USA’s response to attacks on its troops in Jordan has moved out of traders’ view temporarily but remains likely to have some effect on sentiment into next week. The critical release affecting gold today, 2 February, is the job report for January. The figure for total nonfarm is expected to decline around 40,000 to 180,000 while unemployment might edge up to 3.8%. Whatever the result, volatility for gold is likely to increase further around the release at 13.30 GMT.The overall uptrend still seems to be active, with momentum on 1 February having increased and the price pushing clearly above resistance around $2,050. Whether it holds there in the near future depends mainly on the result of the NFP and traders’ reactions to it. However, on the whole the technical picture has become more positive in recent days.Buyers appeared to overcome selling pressure as shown by the large upward real body on Thursday coming after two fairly long wicks. Meanwhile the price remains above all of the 20, 50, 100 and 200 SMAs. The movement on 1 February could be interpreted as an upward breakout from a symmetrical triangle, signalling further gains, but a strong result from the NFP could easily drive the price back down.The pound sterling has been flat overall against the dollar since December 2023 with relatively low volatility. As widely expected, the Bank of England (‘the BoE’) held its rate on 1 February and hinted that it sees further hikes as unnecessary unless inflation starts rising significantly again. For now, it’s probably still too early to make a very educated guess on how long or even whether the BoE’s rate will be higher than the Fed’s this summer.Overall, the American economy certainly seems to be performing better than the UK’s in terms of GDP and employment. Apart from the NFP, traders are looking ahead eagerly this month to American inflation and British preliminary GDP for last quarter on 15 February. If the latter’s negative, the UK is likely in recession.As for gold above, the NFP is the critical release for cable this week. Here, though, the potential for a decisive movement seems to be less. The current $1.27 is the same area as late November’s high and generally one wouldn’t expect a major forex pair to sustain a directional trend for a long time. The base case around the job report seems to be movement towards the top of the channel around $1.282 or the bottom near $1.262 depending on the result.The opinions in this article are personal to the author.

Mali gold production stable at 66.5 metric tons in 2023`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mali-gold-production-stable-66-172435031.html`2024-01-26 17:24:35`BAMAKO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Mali's industrial gold production stood at 66.5 metric tons last year, almost unchanged from 66.2 tons in 2022, the West African country's mines ministry said on Friday.Mali is one of Africa's top gold producers and home to industrial mines operated by international companies including Barrick Gold, B2Gold Corp, Resolute Mining and Hummingbird Resources.According to the ministry's data, Barrick Gold remains the country's biggest gold producer, with an output of 23.5 tons in 2023, followed by B2Gold at 20.6 tons and Resolute Mining at 7.3 tons.With an estimated 6 tons produced in artisanal mines, Mali's total gold production in 2023 is expected to reach 72.5 tons, the mines ministry said.Industrial gold output remained stable year-on-year, failing to reach the forecast of 67.7 tons announced by a mines ministry official.Last November, Mali signed an agreement with Russia to build a 200-ton-per-year gold refinery in the capital Bamako.It also adopted a new mining code that will allow the military-led government to increase its ownership in mining projects to 35% from 20%.More than 70 artisanal gold miners were killed in Mali's southwestern Koulikoro Region last week after the shaft they were working in collapsed.Artisanal mining is a common activity across much of West Africa and has risen in recent years due to growing demand for metals and rising prices. Deadly accidents are frequent, however, as these miners often use unregulated digging methods.

These Are the 4 Best Silver Coin Types To Buy in Order To Turn a Profit`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-best-silver-coin-types-123010528.html`2024-01-26 12:30:10`Silver coins are highly prized by dealers and collectors — not just because of their silver content, but also because they tend to be scarcer than coins minted with copper, nickel, zinc and other metals. The most valuable silver coins sell for millions of dollars, but even ones worth much less than that can turn a tidy profit.See: Lincoln Pennies With Dime Reverse Sides Are So Rare They’ll Fetch Upwards of $100KFind: Pocket an Extra $400 a Month With This Simple HackFinding rare and valuable silver coins outside of dealers and auctions can be a challenge because there aren’t a ton in circulation anymore. The Coinage Act of 1965, signed by President Lyndon Johnson, eliminated 90% silver coins from circulation, according to a blog from ModernCointMart. That law mainly affected U.S. dimes and quarters. Half-dollar coins were still made with 40% silver from 1965 to 1970, but after 1970 no more circulating U.S. coins were made with silver.You can find still find valuable silver coins on the collectibles market, however, and they might be a good investment. If nothing else, adding silver coins can help diversify your portfolio and give you a hedge against inflation and economic volatility. When spot price eventually rises, provided you have a low dollar cost average regarding your silver stack, you can sell for a profit.If you are interested in buying silver coins, here are four basic types as listed by the United States Gold Bureau (USGB).Also: Rare Bicentennial Quarter Has Nearly $20K Value — Plus 7 More Worth Big MoneySponsored: Owe the IRS $10K or more? Schedule a FREE consultation to see if you qualify for tax relief.These are 90% silver coins minted before 1965, as referenced above. “Junk silver,” as a category, represents coinage from their period which holds “no collectible or numismatic value” — and is therefore “worthless” to collectors, according to the USGB. It should be noted that not all 90% silver from that period can be classified as “junk silver,” merely common and/or more damaged or circulated examples. However, you might be able to make a profit from them based on their silver content. As the USGB noted, you can buy these coins cheaply and in bulk to build a large collection with relatively pure silver content.The American Silver Eagle began production in 1986 when the U.S. Defense National Stockpile wanted to get rid of its surplus silver, according to the USGB. One advantage of the American Silver Eagle (ASE) is that it can be used as a silver investment. They’re even eligible as an IRA asset.There are three variations of this 0.999 fine silver coin: bullion ASEs, which are the cheapest and mainly used for silver investing; burnished ASEs, which are the rarest; and proof ASEs, which are the most expensive.The USGB calls the silver Britannia “one of the most recognized rare silver coins on the planet.” The UK Royal Mint created these coins in 1997 following the success of their gold Britannia coins. The 1998 to 2012 editions contained 0.958 pure silver, while those from 2013 on contained 0.999 pure silver. Most of the coins bear images of Queen Elizabeth II, though from 2023 onward the coins bear the visage of King Charles III.This is another silver sovereign coin valued by collectors. It contains 0.9999 fine pure silver and is minted yearly by the Royal Canadian Mint. Like the silver Britannia, many of the Silver Maple Leafs (SMLs) feature Queen Elizabeth II. They have since been updated following the death of the queen in 2022, and newer versions — similarly to the Britannias — feature King Charles III.More From GOBankingRatesI'm a Bank Teller: Here Are 10 Mistakes You Are Making With Your Banking5 Used Cars You Shouldn't BuyUse This Checklist To See Whether Your Bank is Costing You a Lot of Money7 Creative Sources of Passive Income to Consider in 2024This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: These Are the 4 Best Silver Coin Types To Buy in Order To Turn a ProfitRelated Quotes`2024-01-26T12:30:10.000Z`['GC=F', 'ZG=F', 'HG=F', 'SI=F', 'ZI=F']`

It looks like some investors are giving up on the market.""Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei slid 1%, retreating from a 34-year high hit at the start of the week, as bets ramped up that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) could soon exit its massive stimulus.BOJ policymakers agreed to further debate the timing of an exit from its ultra-loose monetary policy, and the appropriate pace of interest rate hikes thereafter, minutes of their December meeting showed on Friday.Separate data on Friday meanwhile showed core inflation in Tokyo slowed below the central bank's 2% target to hit the lowest level in nearly two years.Earlier in the week, the BOJ stood pat on its ultra-easy monetary settings, but signalled its growing conviction that conditions for phasing out its huge stimulus were falling into place.Those expectations helped the yen firm slightly to last stand at 147.56 per dollar.""The overall message is that the BOJ is getting closer to pulling the trigger on calling a first rate hike,"" said Joy Yang, head of Asian economic research at Point72.European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers likewise kept interest rates steady on Thursday, as expected, and reaffirmed their commitment to fighting inflation.However, four sources told Reuters that the ECB was open to a change in its rhetoric at the next meeting, paving the way for an interest rate cut possibly in June, if upcoming data confirms inflation has been vanquished.The euro eased 0.05% to $1.0840 and was on track to end the week with a 0.5% loss.U.S. RESILIENCEIn the broader market, focus was on the release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index later on Friday, with expectations for the so-called core PCE price index - the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation - to rise 3% on an annual basis.Data on Thursday showed the U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter amid strong consumer spending, shrugging off dire predictions of a recession in the world's largest economy.""This release shows further resilience in U.S. growth,"" said David Doyle, Macquarie's head of economics.""While challenges remain ahead that suggest weaker activity, there were encouraging developments.""U.S. Treasury yields slipped in the wake of the report which also showed inflation pressures subsiding further, with the benchmark 10-year yield last at 4.1126%.The two-year yield, which closely reflects near-term interest rate expectations, eased 3 basis points to 4.2850%.In currencies, the U.S. dollar drew support from the strong GDP data, pushing sterling down 0.07% to $1.2702. The Aussie dipped 0.05% to $0.6582.Oil prices eased slightly after settling roughly 3% higher in the previous session, as tensions in the Red Sea continued to pose a threat to global trade.Brent futures dipped 0.4% to $82.11 a barrel. U.S. crude eased 0.57% to $76.92 per barrel.Gold last bought $2,021.50 an ounce.
