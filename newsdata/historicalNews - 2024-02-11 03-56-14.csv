To keep it practical, we’ll show how 3M Company’s (NYSE:MMM) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Based on the last twelve months, 3M’s P/E ratio is 25.97. That means that at current prices, buyers pay $25.97 for every $1 in trailing yearly profits.  Check out our latest analysis for 3M  The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for 3M:P/E of 25.97 = $198.37 ÷ $7.64 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2018.)A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it’s better to pay a low price — but as Warren Buffett said, ‘It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.’When earnings fall, the ‘E’ decreases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others — and that may encourage shareholders to sell.3M’s earnings per share fell by 17% in the last twelve months. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 2.9%. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 1.1% per year over the last three years. This growth rate might warrant a low P/E ratio. This might lead to low expectations.The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that 3M has a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the industrials industry average (26.5).That indicates that the market expects 3M will perform roughly in line with other companies in its industry. So if 3M actually outperforms its peers going forward, that should be a positive for the share price. Checking factors such as the tenure of the board and management could help you form your own view on if that will happen.The ‘Price’ in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.3M’s net debt is 9.8% of its market cap. So it doesn’t have as many options as it would with net cash, but its debt would not have much of an impact on its P/E ratio.3M trades on a P/E ratio of 26, which is above the US market average of 17.9. With some debt but no EPS growth last year, the market has high expectations of future profits.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. People often underestimate remarkable growth — so investors can make money when fast growth is not fully appreciated.

One reason being its ‘too big to fail’ aura which gives it the appearance of a strong and stable investment. However, the health of the financials determines whether the company continues to succeed. Today we will look at 3M’s financial liquidity and debt levels, which are strong indicators for whether the company can weather economic downturns or fund strategic acquisitions for future growth. Remember this is a very top-level look that focuses exclusively on financial health, so I recommend a deeper analysis into MMM here. View our latest analysis for 3MMMM’s debt levels surged from US$11.70B to US$14.01B over the last 12 months , which is made up of current and long term debt. With this increase in debt, MMM’s cash and short-term investments stands at US$4.13B , ready to deploy into the business. Additionally, MMM has produced US$6.24B in operating cash flow in the last twelve months, leading to an operating cash to total debt ratio of 44.54%, meaning that MMM’s operating cash is sufficient to cover its debt. This ratio can also be interpreted as a measure of efficiency as an alternative to return on assets. In MMM’s case, it is able to generate 0.45x cash from its debt capital.At the current liabilities level of US$7.69B liabilities, the company has been able to meet these commitments with a current assets level of US$14.28B, leading to a 1.86x current account ratio. Usually, for Industrials companies, this is a suitable ratio as there’s enough of a cash buffer without holding too capital in low return investments.3M is a highly levered company given that total debt exceeds equity. This isn’t surprising for large-caps, as equity can often be more expensive to issue than debt, plus interest payments are tax deductible. Consequently, larger-cap organisations tend to enjoy lower cost of capital as a result of easily attained financing, providing an advantage over smaller companies. No matter how high the company’s debt, if it can easily cover the interest payments, it’s considered to be efficient with its use of excess leverage. As a rule of thumb, a company should have earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of at least three times the size of net interest. For MMM, the ratio of 22.31x suggests that interest is amply covered. Large-cap investments like MMM are often believed to be a safe investment due to their ability to pump out ample earnings multiple times its interest payments.Although MMM’s debt level is towards the higher end of the spectrum, its cash flow coverage seems adequate to meet obligations which means its debt is being efficiently utilised. This may mean this is an optimal capital structure for the business, given that it is also meeting its short-term commitment. This is only a rough assessment of financial health, and I’m sure MMM has company-specific issues impacting its capital structure decisions.

GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $523 million or 85 cents per share compared with $1,155 million or $1.88 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year decline in GAAP earnings despite higher sales was largely due to tax expense of $762 million or $1.25 per share.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.10, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03.

These rewards, approved by the board of directors, have aided the company’s share price to gain 0.7% yesterday.We believe that such disbursements reflect 3M’s shareholder-friendly policies and strong cash position. Details of Share Buyback & Quarterly DividendUnder the new buyback program, 3M was allowed to repurchase shares of up to $10 billion. This program will replace the company’s existing share buyback programs.Additionally, the company declared that it has been authorized to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $1.36 per share to shareholders of record as of Nov 23. The payment, pertaining to the fourth quarter of 2018, will be made this year on Dec 12. Sound Capital-Allocation Strategies3M uses free resources for strengthening its growth prospects and rewarding shareholders through share buybacks, and dividend payments.Over the last five years (2013-2017), 3M’s annual dividend payments increased from $2.54 in 2013 to $4.70 in 2017. In the first three quarters of 2018, the company distributed a dividend of $4.08 per share. It’s worth noting here that the quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 16% in January 2018.Regarding share buybacks, the company repurchased $3.6 billion worth of shares in the first three quarters of 2018. It had $1.5 billion authorization left in its $10-billion buyback program approved in February 2016.For 2018, 3M anticipates repurchasing shares worth $4-$5 billion. Our TakeWe believe that improvement in profitability and strong cash position will enable 3M to return higher value to shareholders in the years ahead. In the third quarter of 2018, the company’s net income increased 8% year over year. Further, its cash and cash equivalents were $3,185 million exiting the period.For 2018, 3M now anticipates earnings of $9.90-$10.00 per share, with the mid-point reflecting year-over-year growth of 8.5%. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWith a market capitalization of $115.5 billion, 3M currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Solid product offerings, expanding geographical footprints and restructuring initiatives will benefit the company. However, inflation in input prices and high-interest expenses remain major concerns.In the past three months, the company’s share price has decreased 1.5% compared with 9% decline recorded by the industry.Moreover, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share declined 3.1% to $10.02 for 2018 and 3.2% to $10.89 for 2019.3M Company Price and Consensus 3M Company Price and Consensus | 3M Company QuoteSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Macquarie Infrastructure Company MIC, Crane Company CR and Federal Signal Corporation FSS.

On February 20, 2018, the Company and the State of Minnesota announced that they have reached a resolution to end the State's lawsuit against 3M. The state had sued the Company for $5 billion and alleged that drinking water in several east Twin Cities suburbs was contaminated due to disposal of perfluorochemicals (PFCs) over the last fifty plus years adversely impacting the health of people.

This morning, 3M most recent news is on our radar and our team decided to put out a fantastic report on the company that is now available for free below:www.active-investors.com/registration-sg/?symbol=MMM PFC's were used by 3M once to make Scotchgard fabric protector and other products. Research indicates that PFCs are linked to increased risks of cancer, thyroid disease, fertility issues, liver damage, and impacts on growth and learning in children. The settlement was announced by Lori Swanson, Minnesota's Attorney General (AG).Agreement between 3M and State of MinnesotaAs per the terms of the settlement between 3M and the State, both parties have agreed to work together and invest in environment and community. Accordingly, 3M has agreed to provide a $850 million grant to the State for a special fund called - ""3M Grant for Water Quality and Sustainability Fund"". This fund is expected to support water sustainability projects in the Twin Cities East Metro region. This could include projects related to the reduction of PFCs in the environment and to the enhancement of groundwater sustainability. The fund also plans to support projects which encourage and result in habitat and recreation improvements, such as fishing piers, trails, and open space preservation.The Company has also shared that the settlement and related legal fees will negatively impact Company's EPS for Q1 2018 by approximately $1.10 to $1.15 per share.Commenting on the matter, John Banovetz, Senior VP - Research & Development and CTO with 3M, said:""We are proud of our record of environmental stewardship, and while we do not believe there is a PFC-related public health issue, 3M will work with the State on these important projects. Sustainability is embedded firmly at the core of our business. This settlement reflects our commitment to acting with integrity and conducting business in a sustainable way that is in the best interest of all who live and work in Minnesota.""AG Swanson was pleased with the settlement and stated:""We think the settlement will help solve a problem for Minnesota. It's a problem that's been a long time in the making for many decades. These chemicals as I mentioned were put into the ground and we are very hopeful that this settlement can help fix that.""The LawsuitThe lawsuit against 3M was filed in 2010 for contamination of the fish and waterways in Minnesota and later morphed into a case of 3M being held responsible for causing health risks for the residents of the state, especially in the East Twin Cities Metro region.The AG alleged that the Company's use and disposal of petro-fluorochemicals (PFCs) since the 1950's had contaminated the water supplies in East Twin Cities Metro region leading to health problems for the people drinking the contaminated water. 3M owns the patent for PFCs and used them in the manufacture of products like Teflon brand non-stick cookware and Scotchguard stain repellants. The Company had been disposing these chemicals legally at different landfills in the Twin Cities suburbs of Oakdale, Woodbury and Lake Elmo till the 1970s. The Company stopped making PFCs in early 2000s. The AG believed that the Company continued disposing the chemicals with full knowledge that the groundwater could be contaminated with PFCs and would increase health hazards like cancer and infertility amongst the residents in the region. It is estimated that approximately 67,000 consumed the contaminated water in the affected area.Although 3M conceded that the presence of PFCs is widespread it claimed that they were harmless and only caused disease in laboratory animals in ""ultra-high concentrations"". The Company completely denied the AGs allegations that it was knowingly covering up the health risks of PFCs. The Company referred to a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) studies that show PFCs in someone's blood does not necessarily mean their health will be impacted.The case which has been delayed for a long time and was further delayed after a report by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) in February 07, 2018, said that drinking water contaminated by 3M apparently has not caused higher rates of cancer or low birth weights in parts of Washington County compared to the rest of the state. The case was headed for a jury selection of February 20, 2018, when in a dramatic turn, the Company announced the settlement with the State.This is not the end of the matter for 3M as it still faces similar lawsuits related to PFCs across the country.About 3M Co.St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M is a global science Company that never stops inventing. The Company has 46 technology platforms, ranging from adhesives and abrasives, to ceramics and nanotechnology. The Company has $30 billion in sales and offices across over 70 countries. It is also supported by a team of 90,000 employees. Some of the popular brands of the Company include Post-it, Scotch, Scotch-Brite, Command, Filtrete, Nexcare, ScotchBlue, etc.Stock Performance SnapshotFebruary 22, 2018 - At Thursday's closing bell, 3M's stock rose 1.65%, ending the trading session at $236.00.Volume traded for the day: 2.28 million shares.Stock performance in the last three-month – up 1.95%; previous six-month period – up 14.86%; past twelve-month period – up 26.85%; and year-to-date - up 0.27%After yesterday's close, 3M's market cap was at $140.73 billion.Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio was at 26.38.The stock has a dividend yield of 2.31%.The stock is part of the Industrial Goods sector, categorized under the Diversified Machinery industry.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Wal-Mart (WMT), 3M (MMM) and Union Pacific (UNP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Buy-rated Wal-Mart’s shares have been strong performers lately, with the stock up +32.1% over the last six months, outperforming the S&P 500's +13.3% gain in the same time period. Wal-Mart Stores, recently announced plans to drop the “hyphen” and “stores” from its name to officially emerge as an omnichannel retailer. The company has been riding on its robust past record, which derives strength from constant e-commerce initiatives, like buyouts, alliances, surging grocery business and improved delivery systems. Thanks to these trends, along with solid traffic, Walmart’s third-quarter fiscal 2018 marked its ninth and 13th straight quarter of positive earnings surprise and comps growth, respectively. Also, the company’s international business remains a growth driver. However, costs associated with technological and e-commerce investments; mix impact from growing e-commerce operations and a compelling pricing strategy have been hurting Walmart’s gross margin for a while now. Stiff competition and volatile consumer spending also pose threats.(You can read the full research report on Wal-Mart here >>>).Shares of Buy-rated 3M have gained +11.8% over the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which has gained +1.9% over the same period. The Zacks analyst likes 3M's global footprint, diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate different markets. Moreover, 3M is continuing with its portfolio restructuring efforts by divesting assets that no longer fit in its strategy and continues to make investments in other lucrative markets. Portfolio management, investment in innovation and business transformation are the three key levers on which 3M intends to focus. 3M also intends to continue investing in capital expenditures and R&D to support organic growth as it aims a prudent capital structure strategy and increased capital deployment. Furthermore, 3M is standardizing its business processes through a new, global ERP system and expects to save $500 to $700 million annually by 2020. However, high pension expenses continue to be a drag on the company’s bottom line.(You can read the full research report on 3M here >>>).Buy-rated Union Pacific’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Rail industry as well as fellow railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corporation over the last six months. While Union Pacific has gained 29.5%, the industry it belongs to and Norfolk Southern have rallied 15.5% and 25%, respectively, in the same time period. The Zacks analyst expects volume growth to aid Union Pacific's results in the fourth quarter of 2017. Key segments like intermodal and chemicals should drive growth. Detailed results should be out on Jan 25. The company's efforts to reward shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payouts are also impressive. Its efforts to cut costs to drive its bottom line are encouraging too. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be made out from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised 0.7% upward over the last 60 days. However, declining automotive volumes and high debt levels are concerns.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here >>>).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Humana (HUM), Southern (SO) and Western Duke Energy (DUK).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

I’m Rebekah Mintzer, Law.com’s in-house editor, and I’m very pleased to be bringing you another week’s worth of legal department news and insights. In this edition, we’ll talk about the newest venture from UnitedLex, a legal services provider with a reputation for splashy projects—though the in-house experts we spoke to had mixed opinions about how effective the venture would be. Plus, it was a big week for GC moves, but one attorney is taking on a position that most job seekers would probably avoid like the plague. Read on to find out more... If you have tips, story ideas or other feedback, email me at rmintzer@alm.com or find me on Twitter: @rmintzer.When UnitedLex talks, the legal industry tends to listen. So it was with the service provider’s total redesign of DXC Technology’s legal department announced late last year, and again last week when UnitedLex revealed it is partnering with LeClair Ryan to form “ULex Partners.” The new platform will allow law firms to outsource their non-legal operations and benefit from UnitedLex technologies and the ability to access investor funds for new legal technologies. It’s also supposed to improve corporate client service. But do in-house experts see this as a plus? In-House reporter Sue Reisingerasked some of her sources what they thought. She found that feedback was mixed. Color Me Skeptical. Former GE general counsel and current Goodwin Procterpartner Brackett Denniston said he doesn’t think this announcement is the great disruptor that some have said it could be—more just a “broader expansion” of existing outsourcing practices. “UnitedLex is not a secret. It’s not hard to find them.And you don’t have to go to LeClairRyan to locate them,” he told Sue. Thomas Sager, former GC at DuPont, who is now at BallardSpahr, didn’t sing the new project’s praises either. In his view, it should be the role of the corporate client—not the law firm—to oversee the performance of legal service providers like UnitedLex. He said law firms generally “don’t have the business discipline” to manage these engagements well. But Wait….DXC’s Bill Deckelman pointed out some of the venture’s advantages. He said that with ULex Partners, law firms can focus on the work for their clients that really matters, which should make legal departments happy. “At the same time, UnitedLex can significantly enhance the law firm’s client service capabilities through leverage of UnitedLex’s technology, process design and project management discipline,” he added.This week, Sue Reisinger also got the inside scoop on how a company that seems to make every type of product under the sun, The 3M Company, also manages to undertake some great pro bono work around the world. Tone from the Top. It helps if the top legal boss is enthusiastic about a pro bono project, and Ivan Fong, 3M’s general counsel, certainly is. Fong, who oversees 260 in-house lawyers around the world, calls pro bono one of the most “fun and rewarding”activities his department carries out. “Pro bono work exposes legal professionals to new areas of law, and sharpens their legal analysis and client communication skills,” Fong told Sue. Solid Partnerships. 3M makes its pro bono program run with a little help from its friends, which include law firms like Hogan Lovells and Dentons and nonprofit groups like the Legal Aid Society and the International Refugee Assistance Project. In total, 3M works with 20 outside groups to make pro bono happen. Harrowing Tales. Through pro bono, the company’s in-house lawyers have gotten involved in some pretty dramatic legal battles. One 3M compliance counsel shared how he worked with a Syrian college student who was shot and tortured by the government there and had to flee. The lawyer worked to win residency for the student in Germany.In-house leaders are moving up in the world, and getting recognized (rightfully) for what they can contribute to the C-suite. With newfound power comes the growing need for sound advice from peers. In-house reporter Caroline Spiezio recently attended a conference at Stanford University and gathered wise words from the many in-house attorneys from major companies speaking there. Here are some pointers she picked up: ➤ Really “get” what the business does. Just knowing a company’s legal work isn’t going to cut it anymore--knowing the business, products and services, is essential for in-house success. “Once you’ve taken the time to understand how the pieces fit together it can be really powerful because it will buy you credibility with people who might not listen to you,” said Anthony Falzone, deputy general counsel at Pinterest. ➤ Travel as much as you can. Don’t just stay at HQ....Eleanor Lacey, general counsel at Sophos, said that visiting different offices and places where the company operated scored her plenty of points with colleagues and employees. “It was amazing to me how at a senior level [visiting] just seemed to buy me a lot of credibility,” she said.Monday, June 25- Friday, June 29. Global Leaders in Law will hold its Mini MBA for GCs in Oxford, UK. GLL is an invitation-only membership group, offering GCs a global platform for in-person collaboration to exchange ideas and receive advice and guidance from peers. For more information, contact Meena Heath at mheath@alm.com. Tuesday, July 10. Questions of building a harassment and discrimination-free culture have perhaps never been more urgent for legal departments. The New York City Barwill hold an event Shaping Corporate Culture: Best Practices for In-House Counsel in the Wake of #MeToo. Panelists include counsel from J. Crew and Hogan Lovells. Thursday, September 13-Friday September 14. Prominent in-house lawyers willmeet to discuss disruption and the changing role of GCs at Corporate Counsel Forum Europe 2018. The conference, which is co-chaired by two prominent general counsel, Sabine Chalmers of BT and Phillip Bramwell of BAE, will take place in the U.K. at Pennyhill Park, Surrey.A Dream Job? Probably Not. Normally, when a GC makes it to the CEO spot, it’s something to celebrate. But emotions may be more mixed for David Taylor of troubled Theranos, who was promoted late last week after his former boss, CEO Elizabeth Holmes was indicted for fraud. Taylor, who joined the company from Munger Tolles & Olson in 2016 and quickly stepped up to become its acting general counsel, now has to try to make things right for Theranos from the very top of the corporate ladder. Best of luck, David. IP to the Top. In Silicon Valley, heading up the IP side of the legal department can position you for a bigger step someday. Take Dana Rao, the brand new GC at Adobe Systems. The software company announced this week that it had promoted Rao to replace former legal leader Mike Dillon. Rao has been Adobe’s vice president and associate general counsel of intellectual property and litigation since April 2012. Learning the Ropes. Last week, a source close to Bain Capital informed Law.com that the firm is getting a new managing director and general counsel—Christopher Green, who is currently a partner at Ropes & Gray. Green replaces Ropes & Gray alum Sean Doherty, who is leaving Bain after 13 years as head of legal there. Green Is currently co-lead of his law firm’s global private equity and hedge fund SEC enforcement and litigation group. He will begin his transition into the job Sept. 1. Closing on a New Job. Professional services and investment and real estate management company Jones Lang LaSalle has a brand new global GC and corporate secretary. Alan Tse succeeds retiring Mark Ohringer, and will take over in the job June 27. He comes from Petco, where he became GC in 2016. Previously, he was general counsel at Churchill Downs, the company behind the famous Kentucky Derby. Sold! A longtime lawyer at Christie’s auction house, Martin Wilson, is moving on to the rival auction house Phillips. Wilson spent 20 years at Christie’s, most recently serving as global managing director and general counsel to the president’s office. The London-based attorney will lead Phillips’ global legal and compliance functions and also play an active role in top client business development and dealmaking.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Today, I will break down what the P/E ratio is, how to interpret it and what to watch out for.  View our latest analysis for Abbott India  A common ratio used for relative valuation is the P/E ratio. By comparing a stock’s price per share to its earnings per share, we are able to see how much investors are paying for each dollar of the company’s earnings.P/E Calculation for ABBOTINDIAPrice-Earnings Ratio = Price per share ÷ Earnings per shareABBOTINDIA Price-Earnings Ratio = ₹8348 ÷ ₹204.881 = 40.7xOn its own, the P/E ratio doesn’t tell you much; however, it becomes extremely useful when you compare it with other similar companies. Our goal is to compare the stock’s P/E ratio to the average of companies that have similar attributes to ABBOTINDIA, such as company lifetime and products sold. One way of gathering a peer group is to use firms in the same industry, which is what I’ll do. At 40.7, ABBOTINDIA’s P/E is higher than its industry peers (25.5). This implies that investors are overvaluing each dollar of ABBOTINDIA’s earnings. This multiple is a median of profitable companies of 25 Pharmaceuticals companies in IN including Vasundhara Rasayans, Vivimed Labs and Vivimed Labs. You could think of it like this: the market is pricing ABBOTINDIA as if it is a stronger company than the average of its industry group.However, you should be aware that this analysis makes certain assumptions. The first is that our “similar companies” are actually similar to ABBOTINDIA. If not, the difference in P/E might be a result of other factors. For example, Abbott India Limited could be growing more quickly than the companies we’re comparing it with. In that case it would deserve a higher P/E ratio. We should also be aware that the stocks we are comparing to ABBOTINDIA may not be fairly valued. So while we can reasonably surmise that it is optimistically valued relative to a peer group, it might be fairly valued, if the peer group is undervalued.Since you may have already conducted your due diligence on ABBOTINDIA, the overvaluation of the stock may mean it is a good time to reduce your current holdings. But at the end of the day, keep in mind that relative valuation relies heavily on critical assumptions I’ve outlined above. Remember that basing your investment decision off one metric alone is certainly not sufficient. There are many things I have not taken into account in this article and the PE ratio is very one-dimensional.

Notably, diabetes patients using the FreeStyleLibre system in Europe will no longer need to carry the FreeStyle Libre readerseparately to get glucose result. Diabetes patients will now be able to check glucose results directly from their smartphones.Per company, the FreeStyle LibreLink app allows users to hold their smartphone near their FreeStyle Libre sensor to capture and view real-time glucose levels. Also, it shows eight-hour glucose history and how the glucose levels are changing.FreeStyle LibreLink app customers will have access to several updates and new features when compared to the FreeStyle Libre reader. The company also said that the app can replace the reader and also be used in combination with each other.  FreeStyle LibreLink customers will have the option to share information with their physicians through LibreView and LibreLinkUp. These are other digital health tools that are part of the FreeStyle Libre platform.The FreeStyle LibreLink app is free of cost for both iPhone and Android users, and will initially be available in 12 European countries. Also, Abbott is planning for a mobile app solution for FreeStyle Libre users outside Europe, based on in-country regulatory approvals.Developments in FreeStyle LibreFreeStyle Libre System is the flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. The company has been witnessing solid growth in the global Diabetes Care business. Notably, Diabetes Care sales rose 27.6% on a comparable operational basis in the last reported fourth quarter, buoyed by double-digit international sales growth, led by continued consumer uptake of FreeStyle Libre. Accordingly, it is leaving no stone unturned to cash in on the growing popularity of this system that eliminates the need for daily finger sticks.Following the FDA approval in September 2017 for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system, Abbott recently achieved another major milestone after U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) granted FreeStyle Libre approval for Medicare coverage.Meanwhile, Abbott has been steadily progressing with the development of its Diabetes Care segment. Last September, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre in the U.K., marking another milestone for the company. Notably, the FreeStyle Libre system is partially or fully covered in 21 countries, including France, Germany and Japan.Moreover, the company announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System in June 2017. This drove the Diabetes Care segment, which saw revenue growth of 37.6% in third-quarter 2017 on continued acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.Market PotentialAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is expected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development will help Abbott gain traction in this space.Share Price & Estimate Revision TrendAbbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

ABBV together with its partner Neurocrine Biosciences announced that the FDA has approved its pipeline candidate, elagolix, for the treatment of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis, a common gynecologic disorder in women.The candidate to be marketed by the trade name of Orilissa is expected to hit the retail markets in the United States from this early August onward.The approval was granted on a priority review basis. It was supported by positive results from two replicate studies in the largest endometriosis phase III trials, which evaluated Orilissa for the given indication in women. The detailed data from the analysis showed that treatment with Orilissa resulted in statistically significant reductions in menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared with placebo.Endometriosis affects an estimated one in 10 women of reproductive age and is associated with pain symptoms. The pain associated with it is currently managed with oral contraceptives, progestins, danazol, NSAIDS, opioids and GnRH agonists. Many medicines are not specifically indicated for treating endometriosis. With Orilissa approved to treat pain associated with endometriosis, it can address a market with significant unmet need to bring in more sales for AbbVie.Notably, last September, the FDA accepted AbbVie's new drug application (NDA) for Orilissa and subsequently, granted priority review status in October. However, in April this year, the regulatory body extended its review period of marketing application for Orilissa by three months.The FDA requested for a prolonged time frame to review additional information provided by AbbVie along with its NDA related to the results of liver function tests.Shares of AbbVie have decreased 5.4% so far this year versus the industry’s decline of 1.4%.    AbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the pharma sector include Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. VNDA, Illumina, Inc. ILMN and Eli Lilly and Company LLY.

The designation also covers the esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma, which is a cancer that affects the lower part of the oesophagus.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with ABBV. Click here to check it out. ABBV 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ABBVPeter Lynch Chart of ABBVImbruvica is the trade name under which the healthcare company markets ibrutinib. Ibrutinib is a small molecule drug used to treat several B cell cancers.Under the Orphan Drug Act of January 1983, pharmaceutical companies, that otherwise would be discouraged by excessive costs and other issues, are incentivized to try to develop a cure for rare diseases.Rare diseases are those that afflict less than 200,000 people in the U.S. and incentivisation consists of fiscal benefits and a seven-year exclusive right to develop the treatment for a specific condition. The period of seven years begins once the FDA assigns the ""orphan drug"" status.Pharmacyclics, LLC is the sponsor involved into the review process before the designation of the Orphan Drug status is approved by the FDA. Pharmacyclics, LLC is a California-based U.S. biopharmaceutical company, whose core business is to develop cancer therapies. The company, which was purchased by AbbVie in 2015, is the developer of Ibrutinib.AbbVie is currently trading at $109.51 on the New York Stock Exchange. On Monday, the healthcare stock tumbled 4.9% and the current share price is nearly $16.6 above the 52-week range of $60.05 to $125.86.As Yahoo Finance's chart illustrates, for the 52-weeks through Feb. 5, AbbVie has gained 80.6% and outperformed the S&P 500 index by 65%. The stock is down trending since Jan. 26.Source: Yahoo FinanceAbbVie has a dividend yield of 2.42% versus an industry median of 1.58% and versus a S&P 500 current dividend yield of 1.85%.AbbVie has a forward dividend of $2.84 and a forward yield of 2.47%. While the industry has a median forward yield of 1.05%.Despite AbbVie is trading above the 200, 100 and the 50-SMA lines and well over the Peter Lynch's earnings line with and without nonrecurring items, the healthcare stock is still generally perceived as a buy by analysts, who predict that shares can rise a good 14% within the ensuing 12 months of trading.The RSI (14 days) has yet to reach overbought levels. However, downtrend patterns in the indicator leads us to prefigure further downsides to come. I would wait a bit before starting increasing holding AbbVie again.Company's sales are not only well supported by Humira, but the recent sales growth in the RA treatment drug should make investors sleep soundly about the future of AbbVie's flagship and main income source.(Disclosure: I have no positions neither in AbbVie nor in the S&P 500 index nor in any other stocks that belong to the same industry of AbbVie.)This article first appeared on GuruFocus.Warning!

The financial terms of the deal were kept under the wraps.Kaplan, which engages in developing and operating marketing technology platforms and touchpoints, is now part of Accenture Interactive with access to a wide range of design and innovation, marketing, content, and commerce offerings on a global scale.Benefits for AccentureAccenture Interactive considers Nordics as a strategic growth region and the acquisition appears to be the company's bid to expand digital capabilities and enrich creative talent in the region.The acquisition strengthens Accenture Interactive’s customer experience offerings and data-driven marketing capabilities in Nordics.The recent acquisition of business and certain assets of Swedish creative agency — The World Loves in October and the appointment of Adam Kerj as chief creative officer for the Nordic region in August were done to boost the company's Nordics presence.So far this year, shares of Accenture have gained 6.2%, outperforming the 1.9% rise of the Zacks S&P 500 composite. To ConcludeWe believe Accenture’s acquisitions strategy, which helps it broaden its product portfolio, market share and boost revenues, gives it an edge over competitors like Genpact G, Cognizant Technology Solutions CTSH and Infosys INFY.

Although some investors may jump to the conclusion that this is a great buying opportunity, understanding the assumptions behind the P/E ratio might change your mind. Today, I will deconstruct the P/E ratio and highlight what you need to be careful of when using the P/E ratio.  See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland  A common ratio used for relative valuation is the P/E ratio. By comparing a stock’s price per share to its earnings per share, we are able to see how much investors are paying for each dollar of the company’s earnings.P/E Calculation for ADMPrice-Earnings Ratio = Price per share ÷ Earnings per shareADM Price-Earnings Ratio = $46.46 ÷ $3.438 = 13.5xThe P/E ratio itself doesn’t tell you a lot; however, it becomes very insightful when you compare it with other similar companies. We want to compare the stock’s P/E ratio to the average of companies that have similar characteristics as ADM, such as size and country of operation. A common peer group is companies that exist in the same industry, which is what I use. At 13.5, ADM’s P/E is lower than its industry peers (17.2). This implies that investors are undervaluing each dollar of ADM’s earnings. This multiple is a median of profitable companies of 24 Food companies in US including China Modern Agricultural Information, Hostess Brands and Kraft Heinz. One could put it like this: the market is pricing ADM as if it is a weaker company than the average company in its industry.However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on two key assumptions. The first is that our “similar companies” are actually similar to ADM, or else the difference in P/E might be a result of other factors. For example, if you are comparing lower risk firms with ADM, then its P/E would naturally be lower than its peers, as investors would value those with lower risk at a higher price. The second assumption that must hold true is that the stocks we are comparing ADM to are fairly valued by the market. If this does not hold true, ADM’s lower P/E ratio may be because firms in our peer group are overvalued by the market.If your personal research into the stock confirms what the P/E ratio is telling you, it might be a good time to add more of ADM to your portfolio. But keep in mind that the usefulness of relative valuation depends on whether you are comfortable with making the assumptions I mentioned above. Remember that basing your investment decision off one metric alone is certainly not sufficient. There are many things I have not taken into account in this article and the PE ratio is very one-dimensional. If you have not done so already, I highly recommend you to complete your research by taking a look at the following:Future Outlook: What are well-informed industry analysts predicting for ADM’s future growth?

A substantial bounce in the value of the Turkish lira helped to convince many market participants that worries about a possible spread of financial uncertainties were likely overblown, and continuing optimism about the U.S. economy and the prospects for the biggest players in the corporate world helped spur gains. Some companies had particularly good news, and Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ANF), Tapestry (NYSE: TPR), and Advance Auto Parts (NYSE: AAP) were among the best performers on the day. Here's why they did so well.Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch jumped nearly 10% after the latest round of hedge fund disclosures revealed that well-known investor David Einhorn sold off his position in the apparel retailer. Einhorn's Greenlight Capital made numerous sales, ranging from some of the most important tech companies in the world to a number of retailers. Abercrombie's recent results have been solid, but the company hasn't been as reassuring that hard-earned gains will continue. With Einhorn now apparently out of the picture, shareholders can at least have the certainty of knowing that Abercrombie management's strategic moves won't be subject to challenge from activist investors.Image source: Abercrombie & Fitch.Tapestry stock climbed 12% in the wake of the release of the company's fiscal fourth-quarter financial report. The luxury-fashion retailer said that revenue soared 31%, led higher by the acquisition of the Kate Spade retail chain. With the merger, Tapestry now comprises handbag specialist Coach, footwear designer Stuart Weitzman, and Kate Spade. CEO Victor Luis pointed to 2019 as ""a pivotal year"" for the company, especially with Kate Spade, where new collections will test the willingness of the public to embrace the brand after the death of its founder. Even as retail overall has gone through challenges, luxury brands appear to be recovering from the worst of their losses, and that gives Tapestry some tailwinds to help drive its growth in the year to come.Finally, shares of Advance Auto Parts picked up 8%. The auto parts store posted comparable-store sales growth of 2.8% in the second quarter, which helped result in a nearly 25% boost to adjusted earnings per share. Advance also announced that it would authorize stock repurchases of as much as $600 million, or more than 5% of its current market capitalization, amid a brighter outlook for the full year that included revenue expectations of between $9.3 billion and $9.5 billion. With better conditions in the industry and improved execution on an internal basis, Advance Auto Parts wants to make the most of its opportunities while the time is right.

Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned.Advanced Micro Devices has a market capitalization of US$26.69b, so it’s too big to fly under the radar. We’d expect to see both institutions and retail investors owning a portion of the company. Taking a look at the our data on the ownership groups (below), it’s seems that institutional investors have bought into the company. Let’s take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about AMD.  See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices  Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it’s included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Advanced Micro Devices already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 71.6% of the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Advanced Micro Devices, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don’t have a meaningful investment in Advanced Micro Devices. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. As it is a large company, we’d only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it’s worth noting that they own US$246.2m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. With a 27.5% ownership, the general public have some degree of sway over AMD. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past. You can access this detailed graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.To help readers see past the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data.

While AMD might seem like a stock to avoid or sell if you own it, it is important to understand the assumptions behind the P/E ratio before you make any investment decisions. In this article, I will explain what the P/E ratio is as well as what you should look out for when using it. See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro DevicesThe P/E ratio is a popular ratio used in relative valuation since earnings power is a key driver of investment value. By comparing a stock’s price per share to its earnings per share, we are able to see how much investors are paying for each dollar of the company’s earnings.P/E Calculation for AMDPrice-Earnings Ratio = Price per share ÷ Earnings per shareAMD Price-Earnings Ratio = $11.13 ÷ $0.164 = 68xOn its own, the P/E ratio doesn’t tell you much; however, it becomes extremely useful when you compare it with other similar companies. Our goal is to compare the stock’s P/E ratio to the average of companies that have similar attributes to AMD, such as company lifetime and products sold. One way of gathering a peer group is to use firms in the same industry, which is what I’ll do. AMD’s P/E of 68x is higher than its industry peers (24.1x), which implies that each dollar of AMD’s earnings is being overvalued by investors. Therefore, according to this analysis, AMD is an over-priced stock.While our conclusion might prompt you to sell your AMD shares immediately, there are two important assumptions you should be aware of. The first is that our “similar companies” are actually similar to AMD, or else the difference in P/E might be a result of other factors. For example, if you compared higher growth firms with AMD, then its P/E would naturally be lower since investors would reward its peers’ higher growth with a higher price. The second assumption that must hold true is that the stocks we are comparing AMD to are fairly valued by the market. If this does not hold, there is a possibility that AMD’s P/E is lower because our peer group is overvalued by the market.You may have already conducted fundamental analysis on the stock as a shareholder, so its current overvaluation could signal a potential selling opportunity to reduce your exposure to AMD. Now that you understand the ins and outs of the PE metric, you should know to bear in mind its limitations before you make an investment decision. Remember that basing your investment decision off one metric alone is certainly not sufficient. There are many things I have not taken into account in this article and the PE ratio is very one-dimensional.

The stock initially popped following the earnings release, but AMD's shares have been notoriously volatile over the past year, and February was no exception.AMD's revenue increased 33.3% in the fourth quarter to $1.48 billion. The semiconductor specialist's net income vastly improved from a GAAP loss of $0.06 per share in the year-ago quarter to earnings of $0.06 per share. For context, Wall Street was expecting earnings of $0.05 per share. The company also managed to increase its full-year 2017 revenue by nearly 25% year over year, to $5.33 billion.Image source: Getty Images.That was enough good news for investors to push AMD's stock up about 7% the day the fourth-quarter results were released, but it immediately began tumbling over the next few days. To understand why, it's best to take a look at this chart:AMD data by YCharts.AMD's stock has been very volatile for at least the past 12 months. The stock price drop in February likely came because enough investors started thinking that the company's shares were getting too expensive. At the time of the fourth-quarter release, AMD's shares were trading at about 30 times forward earnings and about 21 times book value.AMD stock has continued to slide this month and is down just over 2% as of this writing. The semiconductor company has certainly proved that it can grow its business in an increasingly competitive market, but AMD's share price swings mean that investors will likely have to stomach more ups and downs in the coming quarters.

Favorable earnings from the leader of the social media space suggested that concerns about the misuse of its user data were overblown, which helped to lift market sentiment and spur a rebound from recent weakness. A host of other companies had good news to report as well. Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ALXN) were among the best performers on the day. Here's why they did so well.Shares of Domino's Pizza climbed 7% after the pizza chain reported its first-quarter financial results. Revenue jumped 17% on an 8.3% rise in comparable-restaurant sales within the U.S., showing the strength of the chain's resurgence in popularity, and earnings soared nearly 60% compared to the prior year's quarter. Domino's international segment also did well, seeing a 21% rise in sales over the year-ago period, and the company expects to keep concentrating expansion efforts overseas to bulk up its global reach. With superior metrics compared to competitors in the pizza space, Domino's continues to have a strong grip on the market.Image source: Domino's Pizza.Advanced Micro Devices stock jumped 14% in the wake of the company's first-quarter results. The chipmaker said that demand for central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) remained strong, with demand coming from a diverse set of sources ranging from data centers and video gaming to cryptocurrency mining. In particular, AMD's lines of Ryzen CPUs, Radeon GPUs, and EPYC server chips all look like long-term winners for the company. AMD can expect to see some bumps along the way, especially if bitcoin price volatility leads to a pullback in cryptocurrency-related activity. Nevertheless, AMD has mounted an impressive comeback, and many investors see more potential upside as long as the chipmaker can keep up its momentum.Finally, shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals gained 14.5%. The biopharmaceutical company said that revenue for the first quarter of 2018 rose 7% from year-ago levels, helping push adjusted earnings higher by more than 20%. Yet investors really seemed to respond well to news that a phase 3 study of its long-acting C5 complement inhibitor ALXN1210 demonstrated non-inferiority based on primary and secondary endpoints in patients with a rare blood disease called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. After having had bad luck with some of its pipeline candidate drugs in the past, Alexion investors were pleased to see the company score a promising win.

But if you dig in and look at the component parts of the energy sector, you'll find there are investment opportunities for just about any kind of stock investor. Here's a primer so you can better understand what the energy sector is all about, including a short list of some energy sector stocks you might want to look at today.""Energy"" is often used to refer to oil, which has long been one of the most important global energy resources. However, that's not the only energy source in the world and oil isn't the only energy investment you should be looking at. But let's start there and then move on to other ways to play the broad energy sector.Getting oil and natural gas generally requires drilling a hole and pumping the fuels out of the ground. The notable exception here is oil sands, like those found in Canada, which are mined and then processed to separate the oil out from the earth that's been dug up. Oil sands are referred to as upstream in the oil and gas industry.Energy is a lot bigger than just oil. Image source: Getty Images.There are many companies that focus just on finding oil and extracting it. And there's a great deal of variety within that space, too, as it includes very small companies willing to take on material risks (often called wildcatters) all the way up to large multinationals like ConocoPhillips that are more conservatively run.Production, or how much oil and gas a company is pulling out of the ground, is one of the most important factors to examine. Steady or growing production should be the preference in most cases. Production has to be compared with reserves, or how much oil and gas is still in the ground to pull out. A company that doesn't find new oil and gas to replace what it is producing, via exploration and development spending, will be setting itself up for a dismal future.Also important in all of this is the oil and natural gas price at which a driller can turn a profit. Oil and gas are commodities that go through often volatile ups and downs, causing spikes and dips in the top lines of oil and gas producers. Commodity prices are vital, even though there's little a company can do to control them. It is a problem if a company's production costs are higher than what it can get for the oil it's producing.For example, when oil prices dipped below $50 a barrel following the oil bear market that started in mid-2014, a lot oil drillers were bleeding red ink. Sometimes called a break-even price, the key is that oil and gas commodity prices are high enough to cover both drilling costs and exploration costs. For companies that pay a dividend, distributions to shareholders should be covered as well.Once oil and natural gas are pulled out of the ground, they have to be moved from the well to where they are used and processed from their raw state (crude oil, for example) into a usable one (gasoline and jet fuel). That is where the midstream sector comes in. This is the initial part of the downstream segment of the oil and gas industry. Companies in this sector are frequently structured as limited partnerships, with long-term, fee-based contracts for use of pipelines and processing facilities used to support distributions to unitholders. An example of a large midstream partnership is industry giant Enterprise Products Partners LP. However, there are plenty of regular corporations that operate in the midstream sector as well, including similarly large Kinder Morgan, Inc.Some key factors to examine in the midstream sector are a company's size and reach (larger companies can have scale advantages), the percentage of its business that is fee-based (as opposed to revenue tied to volatile commodity prices), and, for those companies that pay dividends, distribution coverage. Since companies here generally grow by expanding their collection of assets, which can include ground-up construction and acquisitions, you'll also want to keep an eye on capital spending plans.Leverage and share issuances are additional factors to watch, since many midstream companies pass on significant portions of their cash flow to shareholders via distributions and dividends. Unit sales can dilute current unitholders and, if the yield is material at the time of the sale, increase the cost of capital. Debt, meanwhile, can be a useful tool, but it can also increase risk if leverage gets excessive.There's a bit of overlap at this point as we move further downstream. Many midstream companies own pipes and processing facilities, making money for moving oil and natural gas and turning these products into more usable commodities. However, there are some companies, like HollyFrontier Corporation (NYSE: HFC), that focus mainly on the processing side in the downstream space. Key factors to watch here are throughput, or how much oil and gas is being processed, and margins.Unlike midstream companies that usually charge fees for the use of their assets, often including processing facilities, refiners generally make money on the difference, or spread, between the cost of acquiring and processing oil and natural gas and the market prices of the products created. Specialty chemicals tend to have wider margins than commodity materials like gasoline. The breakdown of the products being made should be something you pay attention to as well, since many refiners produce both commodity and specialty products. That said, prices on both sides of the business can be volatile, leading to big swings in profitability.In addition, refiners often have relationships with the locations where products are sold, most notably gas stations. These can consist of silent supply agreements, the use of a refiner's name on the gas station, or outright ownership of gas stations.So we've taken oil and natural gas out of the ground, moved it to processing sites, processed it, and sold it. There are companies focused on each step along the way, but there are also energy companies that do it all under one roof, like integrated energy giant ExxonMobil Corporation. The benefit of the integrated model is scale and diversification. For example, when oil prices are falling, the refining side of the industry will likely be benefiting from low input costs. That helps to even out performance at integrated energy companies.All of the factors that impact drilling, pipeline, and processing/refining companies will be important to watch at integrated oil companies. That said, you'll want to keep an eye on the actual breakdown within each company here. Some have more exposure to upstream operations and some have more exposure to downstream operations. But make sure to monitor production, reserves, and capital spending plans. Break-even points are also important, though often these giant international companies have enough financial strength to use debt to help them through periods of low oil and natural gas prices.Interestingly, it is the integrated energy companies where we are starting see to a convergence between the oil and natural gas side of the energy industry and the electric side, another important component of the big picture of energy. For example, France's Total SA recently agreed to buy an electric and natural gas utility as it executes on its goal of diversifying its business beyond oil.Oil and natural gas don't cover the full spectrum of energy we use and consume every day by a long shot. They're important, but waking up to hot water, a heated home, and lighting -- not to mention all of the fully powered electronic gadgets we use -- is tied to your local electric utility.Usually these companies receive a monopoly to produce and deliver electricity in a specific region in exchange for having the rates customers pay approved by regulators. That said, there are also unregulated energy producers, sometimes called independent power producers, that sell electricity to utilities based on supply and demand or under long-term contracts. And there are companies that own only the transmission assets that are used to move electricity around the country (normally for a set fee), without any exposure to utility plants.There are also utilities that are focused not on electricity, but on the delivery of natural gas. Natural gas utilities work under the same basic model as electric utilities, where a monopoly is granted in exchange for regulation. As with the integrated oil and natural gas companies, however, there are large, diversified utilities that do all of the above, such as Duke Energy, which owns electric utilities, natural gas utilities, and independent power assets (largely renewables).One key factor to look at for electricity producers is their fuel source. Electricity has historically been generated by burning coal, natural gas, and even oil. These are carbon-based fuels that tend to be relatively dirty (gas is the cleanest of the group). However, electricity also gets generated via nuclear power plants, harnessing the sun's rays (solar), using the wind (wind turbines), and water flowing through rivers (hydroelectric). The last three are an increasingly important component of the power grid as the world seeks to focus on cleaner energy options. You'll want to pay attention to the mix here as production increasingly shifts toward cleaner options. Companies with significant exposure to legacy fuels could find themselves at a disadvantage in the stock market and, perhaps, with their regulators.That said, regulated utilities have been transitioning to cleaner energy options for many years. The biggest shift lately has been from coal to natural gas, which many consider a transition fuel between today and a point in time when renewable power is a larger contributor to the power grid. This shift keys in on an important aspect of the regulated utility space: Rates generally get approved based on a utility's spending. So building new generating assets and power lines and upgrading existing assets all increase the odds of a utility getting rate hikes approved. In other words, you'll want to pay attention to capital spending plans here. Regulator relationships are also important, with regulator relationships in some regions more constructive than in others.Execution on big projects is another area on which to focus, since building power plants can cost huge sums and take many years. Problems can be material. For example, SCANA Corporation was recently forced to stop construction on a nuclear power plant in the middle of the project when its contractor went bankrupt. The utility is facing notable regulator and customer backlash, as well as a material financial hit from this decision.With unregulated power generators, meanwhile, you'll want to pay attention to the way in which they sell power. Long-term contracts will provide the most stability, but operating on the spot electricity market can lead to outsize profits during peak demand times. Unfortunately, electric prices on the spot market have been relatively low for many years, outside of brief peaks, making it harder for these companies to turn a profit. That said, there's a shift taking place here as well, with renewable generation displacing carbon options. Unregulated power generators with material carbon-based production could end up with assets that have little value as customers demand cleaner power options.Although not necessarily a part of the energy industry, power is where energy increasingly touches mining. Coal and the uranium used in nuclear power plants are pulled from the ground. (Natural gas is, as noted above, drilled for and included in the energy space.) And some of the companies that mine for these materials have increasingly shifted their business models along with their utility customers. For example, the ""old"" CONSOL Energy started to divest itself of its coal assets (which was the core of the business for over 100 years) as it started to drill for natural gas. It eventually split itself up, with the coal business taking the CONSOL name and the gas business rebranding itself as CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE: CNX).The point here is that just because a company isn't technically in the energy sector doesn't mean that the energy sector isn't an important area to monitor. As another example, a supply demand imbalance in the uranium market is wreaking havoc on Cameco Corp. (NYSE: CCJ) as low commodity prices make turning a profit increasingly difficult. This is partly being driven by overproduction on the mining side of the business, but also by the demand side from utility customers. Demand for nuclear power fell off after the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster in Japan even though long-term construction trends in places like China and India suggest it will recover in the future.If we shift back to oil and natural gas for second, you'll also want to monitor the impact that energy prices have in the drilling services space. Companies like Helmerich & Payne (NYSE: HP) build, lease, and operate drilling rigs. When oil prices fall, demand for this company's products and services tends to fall as well.In the end, energy is an incredibly broad term for a sector that touches a huge portion of our everyday lives and broad swathes of the business world.That said, you need to keep abreast of the energy industry as it changes over time. Although every industry shifts as time goes on, there is a great deal of change going on right now in the energy space. Here are some of the key issues to monitor.At this point, you should be pretty clear on the biggest trend in the energy industry: a shift toward cleaner fuels. For companies engaged in the oil and natural gas sector, this is potentially a very big problem. What they sell is, effectively, being made obsolete. That's a bit of hyperbole, however, because the world is decades away from the day when it no longer needs oil and natural gas. Where the impact has been more meaningful has been in the coal mining industry, as coal-powered generating plants have lost material share of the U.S. power grid. It's likely that coal power will be relatively weak globally, as well, as countries around the world increasingly shift toward cleaner fuel sources.That said, natural gas has actually seen a net benefit from the shift away from coal even though it is a carbon-based fuel. This is because natural gas burns more cleanly than coal and renewable power options aren't yet sizable enough to offset coal's decline. That has left natural gas to pick up much of coal's share of the power grid during the big-picture transition to renewable power sources. This helps explain why some of the largest integrated energy companies are increasingly focused on natural gas and, specifically, liquefied natural gas (LNG) -- the only way to transport the fuel across oceans or to places that pipelines don't reach.The longer-term issue in all of this is the swift growth of renewable power. It's starting from an incredibly small base, so growth won't always be as robust as it is today. But these are still early days in the transition, allowing companies that get in early a huge growth runway. You can invest in this space in a number of different ways, from diversified utilities like NextEra Energy, which gets nearly half of its revenue from renewable power, or with companies like Brookfield Renewable Partners LP (NYSE: BEP) , which is strictly focused on renewable power. Note that Brookfield's core business is well-established hydroelectric power plants, but the partnership's expansion is likely to increasingly be in the solar and wind space.The shift toward renewables is deeper than just a shift away from carbon fuels -- it also touches the consumption side of the equation. For example, the move toward electric automobiles and trucks being pushed by companies like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Efficiency improvements are also a notable aspect of the change, as evidenced by incandescent light bulbs giving way to more efficient fluorescent bulbs giving way to even more efficient LED bulbs. In fact, one of industrial giant Eaton Corp.'s (NYSE: ETN) primary goals is to help customers make better use of power. And while it doesn't make light bulbs, it now makes heavy use of LED bulbs in its large-scale lighting projects (think lighting sports stadiums), and it recently created a division to serve electric-auto makers.So as you think about the energy industry, you should be thinking about what happens after the energy is generated. That means consumption, as noted above, but also the fact that oil, natural gas, and gasoline are easy to store. It is much harder to store electricity. Historically this might have been done by pumping water uphill so that gravity could be used to turn an electric turbine at a later time. But today companies like Tesla and global utility AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) are looking to create batteries capable of storing energy at the household and utility levels, respectively.Another key issue to monitor is the increasingly obvious trend of people producing their own power. That largely means putting solar panels on top of homes. Solar panel manufacturers would seem like a huge beneficiary here, but that hasn't happened. The cost of solar panels has been falling while their efficiency has been increasing amid intense competition and rapid technological advances. This has made it hard for panel makers to achieve lasting profitability.Solar panel installers have been able to capitalize on these trends, however, since the cost to put solar panels on a roof is declining along with solar panel prices. Every new solar panel installation, meanwhile, potentially means less demand for the local utility. To make matters worse, in some cases, utilities are forced to buy extra power from customers at rates higher than the utility's cost of generation. This is known as distributed generation. Although a relatively small issue on a global scale today, it's something that investors will want to keep an eye on over the long term.Is it worth investing in the energy space? The answer is yes, but you need to carefully consider which stocks are the best fit for your portfolio. The energy industry encompasses a huge collection of companies and just about any investor should be able to find something to their liking in the space.Some Energy Stocks Worth Researching TodayNameMarket CapYieldEnergy Sub-Sector(s)NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE)$82 billion2.5%Utility, renewable powerDuke Energy (NYSE: DUK)$58 billion4.5%UtilitySCANA (NYSE: SCG)$5.5 billion1.3%UtilityConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP)$81 billion1.6%Oil and gas drillingExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM)$330 billion4.2%Integrated oil and gasTotal SA (NYSE: TOT)$161 billion4.6%Integrated energyPioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD)$30 billion0.2%Oil and gas drillingEnterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD)$63 billion5.9%MidstreamKinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI)$39 billion4.5%MidstreamCalumet Specialty Products Partners (NASDAQ: CLMT)$0.5 billionN/ARefiningData source: Yahoo Finance. Data as of 8/20/18.Utilities: For example, NextEra Energy's mix of renewable power and regulated utility operations is expected to support earnings growth of 6% to 8% and dividend growth of 10% or more through 2020. Those returns will be driven by capital spending of as much as $44 billion between 2017 and 2020, a relatively low payout ratio, and modest leverage. With a yield of 2.8%, this is really more of a dividend growth stock than your typical utility.Giant diversified utility Duke, which is projecting dividend and earnings growth in the mid-single digits, is more of the slow-and-steady income play you'd expect from an established utility. Duke's current yield is a robust 4.8% and it plans to spend around $37 billion on its business between 2018 and 2022 to support its earnings and dividend growth. It's a good fit for more conservative investors.SCANA, meanwhile, is a special situation stock as it attempts to deal with the fallout from its nuclear power plant decision. In fact, it is a potential acquisition target, adding even more drama to the story. Only aggressive investors should be looking at the stock today.Oil and gas: The same diversity of investment option lives in the upstream oil and natural gas drilling space. For example, ConocoPhillips has a broad reach, with operations in 17 countries around the world. After splitting off its refining assets (its downstream operations), it's a pure-play driller. Moreover, it has an average cost of supply of less than $35 a barrel. Although the plan right now is for disciplined spending and debt reduction, rising oil prices will likely lead to a rising share price for this driller. Investors will also benefit from the company's goal of returning 30% to 40% of cash flow from operations to shareholders via dividends (the yield is a modest 1.6%) and stock buybacks. If you think oil and natural gas are heading higher, this is a good option to consider.At the other end of the spectrum would be a company like Exxon. The yield is currently around 4%, with a 30-year-plus history of annual dividend increases behind it. The integrated oil giant has among the least leveraged balance sheets of its peers and a long history of cautious management. Higher oil prices haven't helped the company as much as peers, however, as it has lagged behind in production growth and its returns on capital employed have fallen from industry-leading levels to simply middle of the pack. It's working to address these issues, but in its typically slow and deliberate way. While management works to turn the ship, conservative investors can get a decent yield from a company that errs on the side of safety every chance it gets.Total, meanwhile, is beginning to push into new spaces as it tries to shift away from its oil and gas history. The recently announced plan to acquire European utility Direct Energie for $1.6 billion materially increases the pace of the transition. Although Total is a big and diversified company taking a largely measured approach in the utility space, that doesn't mean its spending will pan out as expected. I'd rather own a company that's sticking to its core business, like Exxon. But investors with an eye to the future might want to take a look at what it's doing.And then there's an aggressive driller like Pioneer Natural Resources, which continues to blow past analyst expectations with strong production growth. That said, if oil prices should materially decline, robust production growth won't save the company or its investors from commodity-induced pain. This is an even more aggressive play on oil and gas prices than ConocoPhillips, which would be my preference between the two if I had to pick (but I tend to be pretty conservative).Midstream/Pipeline: In the midstream and downstream spaces, conservative investors would probably like what they find at Enterprise Products Partners. It is one of the largest and most diversified owners of pipelines and processing facilities in the United States. It has maintained robust distribution coverage of more than 1.2 times for many years, including through the oil downturn. It also has a relatively modest amount of leverage. And while near-term distribution growth is set to slow as it shifts to a self-funding model, that's simply going to make an already conservative partnership even more conservative. Once the transition to self-funding is complete, however, distribution growth at this 5.8% yielding partnership is likely to pick up again.More aggressive types, meanwhile, might be attracted to Kinder Morgan. It, too, is large and diversified, but it has long taken a more bold approach to growth. For example, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio is roughly 50% higher than Enterprise's. That said, it is projecting robust dividend growth over the next couple of years. This one wouldn't be on my buy list because its aggressive approach led to a dividend cut a few years back, but for risk takers it might be worth a deep dive.As for special situations, the opportunities are huge in the downstream space. For example, refiner Calumet Specialty Products Partners is working its way back from a dividend suspension as it looks to reduce debt and shift more toward high-margin specialty chemicals. It's still a work in progress, as leverage remains elevated and there's no indication that the partnership will resume distributions in the near term. Essentially, it's a turnaround play -- not my preference, but it may be yours.So no matter what you're looking for (income, value, growth, or special situations), you can find something that will fit the bill in the energy stock space. Of course, you need to take the big picture of the energy landscape into consideration, but there's something for everyone in this broadly defined industry.Not everyone, however, wants to be a stock picker. That's understandable, and there are options for index-focused investors as well. For example, if you're fond of midstream stocks (perhaps for their relatively high yields), you should look at the Alerian MLP ETF (NYSEMKT: AMLP). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracks a large basket of midstream partnerships and offers an impressive 8% yield. If you are looking for safe midstream investments, you'd be better off with Enterprise Products Partners. (I prefer to own individual stocks, myself, so ETFs in general aren't a good fit for me.) But if you want to own a collection of midstream stocks without having to do much work, Alerian MLP ETF is a solid option.On the upstream side, you could buy SPDR Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSEMKT: XOP). This exchange-traded fund is heavily focused on smaller exploration and production companies, but also includes some integrated giants and some refiners. If oil prices are heading higher, it should benefit. But for more conservative types looking to focus on integrated energy companies like Exxon, iShares Global Energy ETF (NYSEMKT: IXC) would be a better fit. Roughly 50% of its assets are in larger global oil and natural gas stocks.On the utility side, Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEMKT: VPU) provides broad exposure to this piece of the energy sector. With 74 holdings, you will definitely get diversification, but don't expect much excitement. That said, the current yield is around 3%, which is modestly enticing if you are an income investor. Even in the exchange-traded fund space there are a lot of energy sector options to consider.Energy is both a diverse and changing industry. There's too much going on to say that just one company is the right way to play the space. In fact, there's likely to be something for just about every type of investor if you take the time to dig a little deeper. That said, keep the energy industry's changing dynamics in mind as you do your research. Some companies will be better-positioned over the long term than others.

But if you dig in and look at the component parts of the energy sector, you'll find there are investment opportunities for just about any kind of stock investor. Here's a primer so you can better understand what the energy sector is all about, including a short list of some energy sector stocks you might want to look at today.""Energy"" is often used to refer to oil, which has long been one of the most important global energy resources. However, that's not the only energy source in the world and oil isn't the only energy investment you should be looking at. But let's start there and then move on to other ways to play the broad energy sector.Getting oil and natural gas generally requires drilling a hole and pumping the fuels out of the ground. The notable exception here is oil sands, like those found in Canada, which are mined and then processed to separate the oil out from the earth that's been dug up. Oil sands are referred to as upstream in the oil and gas industry.Energy is a lot bigger than just oil. Image source: Getty Images.There are many companies that focus just on finding oil and extracting it. And there's a great deal of variety within that space, too, as it includes very small companies willing to take on material risks (often called wildcatters) all the way up to large multinationals like ConocoPhillips that are more conservatively run.Production, or how much oil and gas a company is pulling out of the ground, is one of the most important factors to examine. Steady or growing production should be the preference in most cases. Production has to be compared with reserves, or how much oil and gas is still in the ground to pull out. A company that doesn't find new oil and gas to replace what it is producing, via exploration and development spending, will be setting itself up for a dismal future.Also important in all of this is the oil and natural gas price at which a driller can turn a profit. Oil and gas are commodities that go through often volatile ups and downs, causing spikes and dips in the top lines of oil and gas producers. Commodity prices are vital, even though there's little a company can do to control them. It is a problem if a company's production costs are higher than what it can get for the oil it's producing.For example, when oil prices dipped below $50 a barrel following the oil bear market that started in mid-2014, a lot oil drillers were bleeding red ink. Sometimes called a break-even price, the key is that oil and gas commodity prices are high enough to cover both drilling costs and exploration costs. For companies that pay a dividend, distributions to shareholders should be covered as well.Once oil and natural gas are pulled out of the ground, they have to be moved from the well to where they are used and processed from their raw state (crude oil, for example) into a usable one (gasoline and jet fuel). That is where the midstream sector comes in. This is the initial part of the downstream segment of the oil and gas industry. Companies in this sector are frequently structured as limited partnerships, with long-term, fee-based contracts for use of pipelines and processing facilities used to support distributions to unitholders. An example of a large midstream partnership is industry giant Enterprise Products Partners LP. However, there are plenty of regular corporations that operate in the midstream sector as well, including similarly large Kinder Morgan, Inc.Some key factors to examine in the midstream sector are a company's size and reach (larger companies can have scale advantages), the percentage of its business that is fee-based (as opposed to revenue tied to volatile commodity prices), and, for those companies that pay dividends, distribution coverage. Since companies here generally grow by expanding their collection of assets, which can include ground-up construction and acquisitions, you'll also want to keep an eye on capital spending plans.Leverage and share issuances are additional factors to watch, since many midstream companies pass on significant portions of their cash flow to shareholders via distributions and dividends. Unit sales can dilute current unitholders and, if the yield is material at the time of the sale, increase the cost of capital. Debt, meanwhile, can be a useful tool, but it can also increase risk if leverage gets excessive.There's a bit of overlap at this point as we move further downstream. Many midstream companies own pipes and processing facilities, making money for moving oil and natural gas and turning these products into more usable commodities. However, there are some companies, like HollyFrontier Corporation (NYSE: HFC), that focus mainly on the processing side in the downstream space. Key factors to watch here are throughput, or how much oil and gas is being processed, and margins.Unlike midstream companies that usually charge fees for the use of their assets, often including processing facilities, refiners generally make money on the difference, or spread, between the cost of acquiring and processing oil and natural gas and the market prices of the products created. Specialty chemicals tend to have wider margins than commodity materials like gasoline. The breakdown of the products being made should be something you pay attention to as well, since many refiners produce both commodity and specialty products. That said, prices on both sides of the business can be volatile, leading to big swings in profitability.In addition, refiners often have relationships with the locations where products are sold, most notably gas stations. These can consist of silent supply agreements, the use of a refiner's name on the gas station, or outright ownership of gas stations.So we've taken oil and natural gas out of the ground, moved it to processing sites, processed it, and sold it. There are companies focused on each step along the way, but there are also energy companies that do it all under one roof, like integrated energy giant ExxonMobil Corporation. The benefit of the integrated model is scale and diversification. For example, when oil prices are falling, the refining side of the industry will likely be benefiting from low input costs. That helps to even out performance at integrated energy companies.All of the factors that impact drilling, pipeline, and processing/refining companies will be important to watch at integrated oil companies. That said, you'll want to keep an eye on the actual breakdown within each company here. Some have more exposure to upstream operations and some have more exposure to downstream operations. But make sure to monitor production, reserves, and capital spending plans. Break-even points are also important, though often these giant international companies have enough financial strength to use debt to help them through periods of low oil and natural gas prices.Interestingly, it is the integrated energy companies where we are starting see to a convergence between the oil and natural gas side of the energy industry and the electric side, another important component of the big picture of energy. For example, France's Total SA recently agreed to buy an electric and natural gas utility as it executes on its goal of diversifying its business beyond oil.Oil and natural gas don't cover the full spectrum of energy we use and consume every day by a long shot. They're important, but waking up to hot water, a heated home, and lighting -- not to mention all of the fully powered electronic gadgets we use -- is tied to your local electric utility.Usually these companies receive a monopoly to produce and deliver electricity in a specific region in exchange for having the rates customers pay approved by regulators. That said, there are also unregulated energy producers, sometimes called independent power producers, that sell electricity to utilities based on supply and demand or under long-term contracts. And there are companies that own only the transmission assets that are used to move electricity around the country (normally for a set fee), without any exposure to utility plants.There are also utilities that are focused not on electricity, but on the delivery of natural gas. Natural gas utilities work under the same basic model as electric utilities, where a monopoly is granted in exchange for regulation. As with the integrated oil and natural gas companies, however, there are large, diversified utilities that do all of the above, such as Duke Energy, which owns electric utilities, natural gas utilities, and independent power assets (largely renewables).One key factor to look at for electricity producers is their fuel source. Electricity has historically been generated by burning coal, natural gas, and even oil. These are carbon-based fuels that tend to be relatively dirty (gas is the cleanest of the group). However, electricity also gets generated via nuclear power plants, harnessing the sun's rays (solar), using the wind (wind turbines), and water flowing through rivers (hydroelectric). The last three are an increasingly important component of the power grid as the world seeks to focus on cleaner energy options. You'll want to pay attention to the mix here as production increasingly shifts toward cleaner options. Companies with significant exposure to legacy fuels could find themselves at a disadvantage in the stock market and, perhaps, with their regulators.That said, regulated utilities have been transitioning to cleaner energy options for many years. The biggest shift lately has been from coal to natural gas, which many consider a transition fuel between today and a point in time when renewable power is a larger contributor to the power grid. This shift keys in on an important aspect of the regulated utility space: Rates generally get approved based on a utility's spending. So building new generating assets and power lines and upgrading existing assets all increase the odds of a utility getting rate hikes approved. In other words, you'll want to pay attention to capital spending plans here. Regulator relationships are also important, with regulator relationships in some regions more constructive than in others.Execution on big projects is another area on which to focus, since building power plants can cost huge sums and take many years. Problems can be material. For example, SCANA Corporation was recently forced to stop construction on a nuclear power plant in the middle of the project when its contractor went bankrupt. The utility is facing notable regulator and customer backlash, as well as a material financial hit from this decision.With unregulated power generators, meanwhile, you'll want to pay attention to the way in which they sell power. Long-term contracts will provide the most stability, but operating on the spot electricity market can lead to outsize profits during peak demand times. Unfortunately, electric prices on the spot market have been relatively low for many years, outside of brief peaks, making it harder for these companies to turn a profit. That said, there's a shift taking place here as well, with renewable generation displacing carbon options. Unregulated power generators with material carbon-based production could end up with assets that have little value as customers demand cleaner power options.Although not necessarily a part of the energy industry, power is where energy increasingly touches mining. Coal and the uranium used in nuclear power plants are pulled from the ground. (Natural gas is, as noted above, drilled for and included in the energy space.) And some of the companies that mine for these materials have increasingly shifted their business models along with their utility customers. For example, the ""old"" CONSOL Energy started to divest itself of its coal assets (which was the core of the business for over 100 years) as it started to drill for natural gas. It eventually split itself up, with the coal business taking the CONSOL name and the gas business rebranding itself as CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE: CNX).The point here is that just because a company isn't technically in the energy sector doesn't mean that the energy sector isn't an important area to monitor. As another example, a supply demand imbalance in the uranium market is wreaking havoc on Cameco Corp. (NYSE: CCJ) as low commodity prices make turning a profit increasingly difficult. This is partly being driven by overproduction on the mining side of the business, but also by the demand side from utility customers. Demand for nuclear power fell off after the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster in Japan even though long-term construction trends in places like China and India suggest it will recover in the future.If we shift back to oil and natural gas for second, you'll also want to monitor the impact that energy prices have in the drilling services space. Companies like Helmerich & Payne (NYSE: HP) build, lease, and operate drilling rigs. When oil prices fall, demand for this company's products and services tends to fall as well.In the end, energy is an incredibly broad term for a sector that touches a huge portion of our everyday lives and broad swathes of the business world.That said, you need to keep abreast of the energy industry as it changes over time. Although every industry shifts as time goes on, there is a great deal of change going on right now in the energy space. Here are some of the key issues to monitor.At this point, you should be pretty clear on the biggest trend in the energy industry: a shift toward cleaner fuels. For companies engaged in the oil and natural gas sector, this is potentially a very big problem. What they sell is, effectively, being made obsolete. That's a bit of hyperbole, however, because the world is decades away from the day when it no longer needs oil and natural gas. Where the impact has been more meaningful has been in the coal mining industry, as coal-powered generating plants have lost material share of the U.S. power grid. It's likely that coal power will be relatively weak globally, as well, as countries around the world increasingly shift toward cleaner fuel sources.That said, natural gas has actually seen a net benefit from the shift away from coal even though it is a carbon-based fuel. This is because natural gas burns more cleanly than coal and renewable power options aren't yet sizable enough to offset coal's decline. That has left natural gas to pick up much of coal's share of the power grid during the big-picture transition to renewable power sources. This helps explain why some of the largest integrated energy companies are increasingly focused on natural gas and, specifically, liquefied natural gas (LNG) -- the only way to transport the fuel across oceans or to places that pipelines don't reach.The longer-term issue in all of this is the swift growth of renewable power. It's starting from an incredibly small base, so growth won't always be as robust as it is today. But these are still early days in the transition, allowing companies that get in early a huge growth runway. You can invest in this space in a number of different ways, from diversified utilities like NextEra Energy, which gets nearly half of its revenue from renewable power, or with companies like Brookfield Renewable Partners LP (NYSE: BEP) , which is strictly focused on renewable power. Note that Brookfield's core business is well-established hydroelectric power plants, but the partnership's expansion is likely to increasingly be in the solar and wind space.The shift toward renewables is deeper than just a shift away from carbon fuels -- it also touches the consumption side of the equation. For example, the move toward electric automobiles and trucks being pushed by companies like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Efficiency improvements are also a notable aspect of the change, as evidenced by incandescent light bulbs giving way to more efficient fluorescent bulbs giving way to even more efficient LED bulbs. In fact, one of industrial giant Eaton Corp.'s (NYSE: ETN) primary goals is to help customers make better use of power. And while it doesn't make light bulbs, it now makes heavy use of LED bulbs in its large-scale lighting projects (think lighting sports stadiums), and it recently created a division to serve electric-auto makers.So as you think about the energy industry, you should be thinking about what happens after the energy is generated. That means consumption, as noted above, but also the fact that oil, natural gas, and gasoline are easy to store. It is much harder to store electricity. Historically this might have been done by pumping water uphill so that gravity could be used to turn an electric turbine at a later time. But today companies like Tesla and global utility AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) are looking to create batteries capable of storing energy at the household and utility levels, respectively.Another key issue to monitor is the increasingly obvious trend of people producing their own power. That largely means putting solar panels on top of homes. Solar panel manufacturers would seem like a huge beneficiary here, but that hasn't happened. The cost of solar panels has been falling while their efficiency has been increasing amid intense competition and rapid technological advances. This has made it hard for panel makers to achieve lasting profitability.Solar panel installers have been able to capitalize on these trends, however, since the cost to put solar panels on a roof is declining along with solar panel prices. Every new solar panel installation, meanwhile, potentially means less demand for the local utility. To make matters worse, in some cases, utilities are forced to buy extra power from customers at rates higher than the utility's cost of generation. This is known as distributed generation. Although a relatively small issue on a global scale today, it's something that investors will want to keep an eye on over the long term.Is it worth investing in the energy space? The answer is yes, but you need to carefully consider which stocks are the best fit for your portfolio. The energy industry encompasses a huge collection of companies and just about any investor should be able to find something to their liking in the space.Some Energy Stocks Worth Researching TodayNameMarket CapYieldEnergy Sub-Sector(s)NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE)$82 billion2.5%Utility, renewable powerDuke Energy (NYSE: DUK)$58 billion4.5%UtilitySCANA (NYSE: SCG)$5.5 billion1.3%UtilityConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP)$81 billion1.6%Oil and gas drillingExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM)$330 billion4.2%Integrated oil and gasTotal SA (NYSE: TOT)$161 billion4.6%Integrated energyPioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD)$30 billion0.2%Oil and gas drillingEnterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD)$63 billion5.9%MidstreamKinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI)$39 billion4.5%MidstreamCalumet Specialty Products Partners (NASDAQ: CLMT)$0.5 billionN/ARefiningData source: Yahoo Finance. Data as of 8/20/18.Utilities: For example, NextEra Energy's mix of renewable power and regulated utility operations is expected to support earnings growth of 6% to 8% and dividend growth of 10% or more through 2020. Those returns will be driven by capital spending of as much as $44 billion between 2017 and 2020, a relatively low payout ratio, and modest leverage. With a yield of 2.8%, this is really more of a dividend growth stock than your typical utility.Giant diversified utility Duke, which is projecting dividend and earnings growth in the mid-single digits, is more of the slow-and-steady income play you'd expect from an established utility. Duke's current yield is a robust 4.8% and it plans to spend around $37 billion on its business between 2018 and 2022 to support its earnings and dividend growth. It's a good fit for more conservative investors.SCANA, meanwhile, is a special situation stock as it attempts to deal with the fallout from its nuclear power plant decision. In fact, it is a potential acquisition target, adding even more drama to the story. Only aggressive investors should be looking at the stock today.Oil and gas: The same diversity of investment option lives in the upstream oil and natural gas drilling space. For example, ConocoPhillips has a broad reach, with operations in 17 countries around the world. After splitting off its refining assets (its downstream operations), it's a pure-play driller. Moreover, it has an average cost of supply of less than $35 a barrel. Although the plan right now is for disciplined spending and debt reduction, rising oil prices will likely lead to a rising share price for this driller. Investors will also benefit from the company's goal of returning 30% to 40% of cash flow from operations to shareholders via dividends (the yield is a modest 1.6%) and stock buybacks. If you think oil and natural gas are heading higher, this is a good option to consider.At the other end of the spectrum would be a company like Exxon. The yield is currently around 4%, with a 30-year-plus history of annual dividend increases behind it. The integrated oil giant has among the least leveraged balance sheets of its peers and a long history of cautious management. Higher oil prices haven't helped the company as much as peers, however, as it has lagged behind in production growth and its returns on capital employed have fallen from industry-leading levels to simply middle of the pack. It's working to address these issues, but in its typically slow and deliberate way. While management works to turn the ship, conservative investors can get a decent yield from a company that errs on the side of safety every chance it gets.Total, meanwhile, is beginning to push into new spaces as it tries to shift away from its oil and gas history. The recently announced plan to acquire European utility Direct Energie for $1.6 billion materially increases the pace of the transition. Although Total is a big and diversified company taking a largely measured approach in the utility space, that doesn't mean its spending will pan out as expected. I'd rather own a company that's sticking to its core business, like Exxon. But investors with an eye to the future might want to take a look at what it's doing.And then there's an aggressive driller like Pioneer Natural Resources, which continues to blow past analyst expectations with strong production growth. That said, if oil prices should materially decline, robust production growth won't save the company or its investors from commodity-induced pain. This is an even more aggressive play on oil and gas prices than ConocoPhillips, which would be my preference between the two if I had to pick (but I tend to be pretty conservative).Midstream/Pipeline: In the midstream and downstream spaces, conservative investors would probably like what they find at Enterprise Products Partners. It is one of the largest and most diversified owners of pipelines and processing facilities in the United States. It has maintained robust distribution coverage of more than 1.2 times for many years, including through the oil downturn. It also has a relatively modest amount of leverage. And while near-term distribution growth is set to slow as it shifts to a self-funding model, that's simply going to make an already conservative partnership even more conservative. Once the transition to self-funding is complete, however, distribution growth at this 5.8% yielding partnership is likely to pick up again.More aggressive types, meanwhile, might be attracted to Kinder Morgan. It, too, is large and diversified, but it has long taken a more bold approach to growth. For example, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio is roughly 50% higher than Enterprise's. That said, it is projecting robust dividend growth over the next couple of years. This one wouldn't be on my buy list because its aggressive approach led to a dividend cut a few years back, but for risk takers it might be worth a deep dive.As for special situations, the opportunities are huge in the downstream space. For example, refiner Calumet Specialty Products Partners is working its way back from a dividend suspension as it looks to reduce debt and shift more toward high-margin specialty chemicals. It's still a work in progress, as leverage remains elevated and there's no indication that the partnership will resume distributions in the near term. Essentially, it's a turnaround play -- not my preference, but it may be yours.So no matter what you're looking for (income, value, growth, or special situations), you can find something that will fit the bill in the energy stock space. Of course, you need to take the big picture of the energy landscape into consideration, but there's something for everyone in this broadly defined industry.Not everyone, however, wants to be a stock picker. That's understandable, and there are options for index-focused investors as well. For example, if you're fond of midstream stocks (perhaps for their relatively high yields), you should look at the Alerian MLP ETF (NYSEMKT: AMLP). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracks a large basket of midstream partnerships and offers an impressive 8% yield. If you are looking for safe midstream investments, you'd be better off with Enterprise Products Partners. (I prefer to own individual stocks, myself, so ETFs in general aren't a good fit for me.) But if you want to own a collection of midstream stocks without having to do much work, Alerian MLP ETF is a solid option.On the upstream side, you could buy SPDR Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSEMKT: XOP). This exchange-traded fund is heavily focused on smaller exploration and production companies, but also includes some integrated giants and some refiners. If oil prices are heading higher, it should benefit. But for more conservative types looking to focus on integrated energy companies like Exxon, iShares Global Energy ETF (NYSEMKT: IXC) would be a better fit. Roughly 50% of its assets are in larger global oil and natural gas stocks.On the utility side, Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEMKT: VPU) provides broad exposure to this piece of the energy sector. With 74 holdings, you will definitely get diversification, but don't expect much excitement. That said, the current yield is around 3%, which is modestly enticing if you are an income investor. Even in the exchange-traded fund space there are a lot of energy sector options to consider.Energy is both a diverse and changing industry. There's too much going on to say that just one company is the right way to play the space. In fact, there's likely to be something for just about every type of investor if you take the time to dig a little deeper. That said, keep the energy industry's changing dynamics in mind as you do your research. Some companies will be better-positioned over the long term than others.

Incredible mix of preeminent leaders, passionate change-makers and rising stars of all ages. More than a conference: it’s invitation-only, off-the-record. Non-partisan: All participants heard, all opinions welcome. More light than heat.”No political or commercial agenda. Yet the Weekends' friendships have fostered hundreds of commercial ventures, historic projects, and commitments to public service. Urgent questions of our times are examined with candor: All participants, heard; broadly divergent views, expressed. Eminent adversaries disagree without being disagreeable. The alchemy of ideas and substantive relationships has an incredibly transforming power.Part of the magic of these weekends is that the discussion themes must be general and unattributed, and “…what happens at Renaissance, stays at Renaissance…” but we do learn in this conversation about some poignant, instructive, some surprising experiences they have had in more than 130 weekends thus far.It shouldn’t be a surprise, as the hosts are amazingly accomplished have must have the world’s best Rolodex. Ambassador Philip Lader graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Duke University, received his master’s in History from the University of Michigan, and completed graduate law studies at Pembroke College, Oxford University, and received his J.D. as a Leopold Schepp Scholar from Harvard Law.Linda LeSourd Lader received her Bachelor’s Degree from Ohio Wesleyan University and then went to Yale Divinity School where she received her Masters of Divinity.Philip is the former U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James’s and Chairman of WPP plc and is a Senior Adviser to Morgan Stanley.Ambassador Lader served in President Clinton’s Cabinet while Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration and was White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Assistant to the President, and Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Previously, he was Executive Vice President of Sir James Goldsmith’s U.S. holdings and President of Sea Pines Company as well as universities in South Carolina and Australia.A trustee of the RAND Corporation and an Honorary Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford University, and London Business School, an Honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple (Inns of Court), and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Philip has served on the boards of Lloyds of London, the American Red Cross, the British Museum, St. Paul's Cathedral, the Smithsonian Museum of American History, the Atlantic Council, Marathon Oil, AES, Minerva and Rusal Corporations, as well as several banks and universities.He has also been a partner in the Nelson Mullins law firm and President of Business Executives for National Security. He holds 14 honorary doctorates, and has won the Benjamin Franklin Medal, the Rotary International Foundation’s Global Service to Humanity Award, and the British-American Business’ Founders Award.Linda, ordained Presbyterian minister, is President of the Renaissance Institute. She is a graduate of Yale Divinity School and Ohio Wesleyan University. Formerly she was Associate Pastor of Washington, D.C.'s historic New York Avenue Presbyterian Church.Reflecting a career-long commitment to non-profit initiatives, she has served on the boards of Habitat for Humanity, Yale Divinity School, Communities in Schools, Spoleto USA, Alpha USA, International Justice Mission, Harvard Divinity School's Center for the Study of Values in Public Life, Sojourners, the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and the American International University in London.From 1993 to 1996, she assisted with White House liaison to American communities of faith and advised the President on public policy issues pertaining to religion. Associated with the National Prayer Breakfast Ministries throughout the 1970s, she coordinated the 1979 National Prayer Breakfast. In recognition of such public service, she received the International Women’s Foundation Leadership Award in 2000 and the 2012 Humanitarian Award from Emma Willard School, her alma mater.Her editing work continues the tradition of her parents — Leonard LeSourd, longtime editor of ""Guideposts"" and Catherine Marshall, author of A Man Called Peter, Christy and other best-sellers.In this episode, you’ll enjoy not only learning about the world-wide adventures this powerhouse couple and their daughters, Mary-Catherine and Whitaker, have experienced—from rock stars to the Queen Mother.They have developed a way to build bridges among innovative leaders from diverse fields, one weekend at a time, with their families.

Incredible mix of preeminent leaders, passionate change-makers and rising stars of all ages. More than a conference: it’s invitation-only, off-the-record. Non-partisan: All participants heard, all opinions welcome. More light than heat.”No political or commercial agenda. Yet the Weekends' friendships have fostered hundreds of commercial ventures, historic projects, and commitments to public service. Urgent questions of our times are examined with candor: All participants, heard; broadly divergent views, expressed. Eminent adversaries disagree without being disagreeable. The alchemy of ideas and substantive relationships has an incredibly transforming power.Part of the magic of these weekends is that the discussion themes must be general and unattributed, and “…what happens at Renaissance, stays at Renaissance…” but we do learn in this conversation about some poignant, instructive, some surprising experiences they have had in more than 130 weekends thus far.It shouldn’t be a surprise, as the hosts are amazingly accomplished have must have the world’s best Rolodex. Ambassador Philip Lader graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Duke University, received his master’s in History from the University of Michigan, and completed graduate law studies at Pembroke College, Oxford University, and received his J.D. as a Leopold Schepp Scholar from Harvard Law.Linda LeSourd Lader received her Bachelor’s Degree from Ohio Wesleyan University and then went to Yale Divinity School where she received her Masters of Divinity.Philip is the former U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James’s and Chairman of WPP plc and is a Senior Adviser to Morgan Stanley.Ambassador Lader served in President Clinton’s Cabinet while Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration and was White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Assistant to the President, and Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Previously, he was Executive Vice President of Sir James Goldsmith’s U.S. holdings and President of Sea Pines Company as well as universities in South Carolina and Australia.A trustee of the RAND Corporation and an Honorary Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford University, and London Business School, an Honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple (Inns of Court), and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Philip has served on the boards of Lloyds of London, the American Red Cross, the British Museum, St. Paul's Cathedral, the Smithsonian Museum of American History, the Atlantic Council, Marathon Oil, AES, Minerva and Rusal Corporations, as well as several banks and universities.He has also been a partner in the Nelson Mullins law firm and President of Business Executives for National Security. He holds 14 honorary doctorates, and has won the Benjamin Franklin Medal, the Rotary International Foundation’s Global Service to Humanity Award, and the British-American Business’ Founders Award.Linda, ordained Presbyterian minister, is President of the Renaissance Institute. She is a graduate of Yale Divinity School and Ohio Wesleyan University. Formerly she was Associate Pastor of Washington, D.C.'s historic New York Avenue Presbyterian Church.Reflecting a career-long commitment to non-profit initiatives, she has served on the boards of Habitat for Humanity, Yale Divinity School, Communities in Schools, Spoleto USA, Alpha USA, International Justice Mission, Harvard Divinity School's Center for the Study of Values in Public Life, Sojourners, the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and the American International University in London.From 1993 to 1996, she assisted with White House liaison to American communities of faith and advised the President on public policy issues pertaining to religion. Associated with the National Prayer Breakfast Ministries throughout the 1970s, she coordinated the 1979 National Prayer Breakfast. In recognition of such public service, she received the International Women’s Foundation Leadership Award in 2000 and the 2012 Humanitarian Award from Emma Willard School, her alma mater.Her editing work continues the tradition of her parents — Leonard LeSourd, longtime editor of ""Guideposts"" and Catherine Marshall, author of A Man Called Peter, Christy and other best-sellers.In this episode, you’ll enjoy not only learning about the world-wide adventures this powerhouse couple and their daughters, Mary-Catherine and Whitaker, have experienced—from rock stars to the Queen Mother.They have developed a way to build bridges among innovative leaders from diverse fields, one weekend at a time, with their families. I think that trumps TED, Aspen, and comes close to Davos, but you don’t bring the kids to Davos to speak!Linda and Phil are truly living their lives in full, and helping to me the world a much better place.Listen on iTunes or download here.

These days, it is probably best known for its loveable spokesperson, that seemingly ubiquitous Aflac duck. Over the past year, the company's stock has nearly matched the S&P 500 index blow for blow, with appreciation between the two within a single percentage point over the time period.When the company reported its second-quarter earnings last month, the numbers appeared decent for a stock price firmly rooted in value territory. Total revenues grew to $5.6 billion, a 3% increase year over year, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped to $1.07, a 20.2% increase year over year.After reviewing the company's second-quarter conference call, transcribed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, I believe there are three noteworthy takeaways for investors from the quarter. Let's take a closer look at each.Aflac sells third-sector insurance policies, which cover things such as injuries and illnesses. Image source: Getty Images.One thing casual investors might not know about Aflac is that most of its sales, usually in the neighborhood of two-thirds, are actually generated in Japan, not the U.S. This quarter, total revenues for Aflac Japan amounted to $3.8 billion, or about 67% of the company's total. In the company's first quarter, CEO Daniel Amos stated the delayed launch of new cancer insurance plans led to challenges.This quarter, with the launch of the new plans acting as a tailwind, sales in third-sector insurance products soared. (Third-sector insurance policies refer to insurance products for things such as sickness, injuries, and hospital stays. First sector is life insurance; second sector is for property.) In the conference call, Amos said:Aflac Japan's outstanding third sector sales increase of 16% was well above our expectations. The strong results was largely due to April's introduction of our new cancer insurance product. ... First, the new cancer insurance policy offered popular enhanced benefit features, while carefully managing the risk profiles of the product as we've done in the past. In addition, we launched a targeted promotional campaign for all this cancers -- the new cancer product that incorporated television ads with the largest direct mail campaign we have ever done. And finally, we fully engaged our wide-reaching distribution network.Amos also credited a large distribution network provided through a key partnership with Japan Post for driving sales.One of the best ways to measure the profitability of an insurer is by looking at its combined ratio, the sum of claim-related losses and business expenses divided by its earned premiums. This formula measures an insurer's profitability before the investment gain it earns on its float is taken into consideration.For Aflac, all applicable figures can be found on its latest 10-Q filing with the SEC. For the numerator, go to page three and add Aflac's ""Benefits and claims, net"" with ""Total acquisition and operating expenses."" The denominator can be found by adding Aflac Japan's and Aflac U.S.'s net earned premiums from page 16 of the 10-Q. This looks like:(3,031 + 1,427)/(3,227 + 1,426) = 0.96As a good rule of thumb, I look for a ratio under 1.0, indicating the insurance company is profitable from its policy underwriting before its investment income is taken into account. I have been a shareholder for Aflac for quite a while and calculate this formula almost every single quarter and have never found it to be above 1.0.Aflac's management continues a shareholder-friendly approach. In Q2, Aflac repurchased about $306 million worth of shares and maintained its target of $1.1 to $1.4 billion of buybacks for the full calendar year.Headed into the 2017 fourth quarter, Aflac raised its dividend 4.7%, marking the 35th consecutive year Aflac had hiked its payout to shareholders. The streak easily places Aflac among the elite group of Dividend Aristocrats, companies in the S&P 500 index that have raised their dividend for the past 25 consecutive years. In the first quarter, Aflac then raised its dividend again, this time by 15.6%, citing tax reform as the reason for the hike. The $0.26 quarterly dividend gives the stock a decent 2.23% yield while sporting a low payout ratio under 30%.Aflac remains a company performing well and selling at a discount to the vast majority of the market. Based on the midpoint of its full-year 2018 guidance, Aflac sports a P/E ratio of just 11.7. While it will never be mistaken for a sexy tech stock, sometimes slow and steady does win the race. Maybe the tortoise -- scratch that -- the duck can beat the hare. Aflac offers investors an undervalued stock with a management team willing to reward investors with consistent dividend hikes and share buybacks. All in all, Aflac is a company that value investors might want to reserve a place for in their portfolios.

Tillman describes Aflac as a leading provider of voluntary insurance. Known for television commercials featuring its mascot, the Aflac Duck, the company touts its ability to pay cash benefits fast when a policyholder gets sick or hurt. Although the company is headquartered in Columbus, Georgia, about 75 percent of its proceeds come from Japan, Tillman says. As general counsel, Tillman directs Aflac’s legal division and functions related to corporate communications, federal relations, global cybersecurity, human resources, the office of the corporate secretary and government regulations. She also oversees the general counsel and compliance offices at Aflac Japan. LEGAL TEAM: Aflac’s legal division has 26 team members, including 13 lawyers. In addition to the lawyers on the legal team, there are attorneys Tillman oversees in other divisions, including the company’s state and federal regulations, U.S. and Japan compliance and cybersecurity teams. Because of its small size, the legal division outsources much of its work. “We have a diversity of counsel we go to,” Tillman says. OUTSIDE COUNSEL: Aflac has had a longstanding relationship with Alston & Bird, headquartered in Atlanta. Tillman says the firm handles employment law matters for the company. For matters involving securities or governance work, the company turns to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which has its headquarters in New York City. The company also uses a number of smaller firms and individual lawyers as its outside counsel, Tillman says. DAILY DUTIES: “My day can start very, very early and end very late,” Tillman says, noting that she may begin the day in a meeting with colleagues in Japan and end the day at a meeting in Aflac’s headquarters. “I’m in a lot of meetings,” she says. Tillman says she is available to consult with or advise the company’s chief executive officer or members of the executive committee or board of directors. She says she also maintains a large network of general counsel at other companies as a sounding board. ROUTE TO THE TOP: After graduating from the University of Georgia School of Law, Tillman served as a law clerk for Judge Richard C. Erwin, then-chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. Working for Erwin made her see the application of everything she had studied in law school, Tillman says. Tillman also worked as an associate in the Greensboro office of Smith Helms Mulliss & Moore, which she says was the largest law firm in North Carolina at the time, and served as an associate professor at North Carolina School of Law. Tillman joined Aflac as a staff attorney in January 1996 after her husband, Dr. Chip Tillman, accepted a medical position in Columbus. She did not remain a staff attorney for long, however. “I tell people all the time you can get to the top by starting at the bottom,” she says. In 1997, Tillman was promoted to second vice president of the legal department and became vice president in 2000. She became senior vice president of human resources in August 2001 and executive vice president of corporate services in 2008. Heading the different business units at Aflac helped broaden her perspective of the company’s business, she says. PERSONAL: Tillman, 52, and her physician husband, whose practice focuses on internal and sports medicine, have been married 27 years. They have three children, one in college and two in high school. LAST BOOK READ: The last book Tillman had read at the time of this interview was nonfiction, “A Hillbilly Elegy” by J.D. Vance. “It was very enlightening on a number of levels,” she says. WHAT KEEPS HER UP AT NIGHT: Tillman says she worries about cybersecurity: “To know there are constantly people out there trying to get your confidential information for profit.” PRIORITIES: Tillman says she wants the leaders who report to her to see a broader view of Aflac than just what is on their desk. “As the business is trying to evolve, we have to evolve,” she says.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

With supplemental insurance products for workers both in the U.S. and Japan, Aflac has tapped into the need among employees to go beyond the default group coverage that employers typically provide as part of their benefits packages.Coming into Wednesday's first-quarter financial report, Aflac investors hoped that the insurer would be able to keep up its positive momentum and continue to find new ways to serve its customer base. With a corporate move to make its Japanese business into a subsidiary, Aflac hopes to keep making incremental progress in boosting revenue and net income for years to come.Image source: Aflac.Aflac's first-quarter results were largely favorable. Revenue was higher by 3% at $5.46 billion, more or less matching what most investors were expecting on Aflac's top line. Net income jumped 21% to $717 million, and after making allowances for extraordinary items, adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share were far higher than the consensus forecast of $0.97 per share among those following the stock.Aflac turned things around from previous quarters largely because of a reversal in the prior strength of the U.S. dollar. The Japanese yen strengthened by about 5% during the quarter compared to the year-earlier period, and that helped make Aflac Japan's growth rates stronger than they were in local-currency terms. Aflac said that the currency gains added about $0.03 per share to its bottom line for the quarter.Even so, Aflac continued to see pressure on its Japanese operations due to its extensive restructuring efforts across the Pacific. Premium income fell 2.6% in local-currency terms, with stable investment income helping to cushion the blow to some extent. Adjusted earnings for the segment inched higher by about 1%, thanks largely to stronger profit margin figures. Even so, weakness in sales of cancer, medical, and income support products sent what Aflac calls its third-sector sales downward by double-digit percentages, as the unit faced difficult comparisons with prior-year results as Aflac contemplates new product rollouts.U.S. results were better for the insurance company. Premium income climbed 2.7%, and a slight decline in investment income still left total revenue higher overall. Adjusted pre-tax earnings were higher by 9%, reflecting better margin.One thing that Aflac did during the quarter that will have some impact on future performance is to make Aflac Japan into a formal subsidiary. CEO Daniel Amos described the move, saying, ""This new corporate structure aligns Aflac with global regulatory frameworks and enhances our financial and business flexibility, while remaining consistent with our current financial strength ratings and enterprise risk management framework."" The CEO also pointed to solid strategies in the U.S. market even as it works to keep improving things in Japan.Looking ahead, Aflac believes it can build even more momentum going forward. The company believes that third-sector sales in Japan should return to their historical 2% to 3% growth rate, and acceleration later in the year in the U.S. could pull full-year sales growth for the segment upward by 3% to 5%. Returning capital to shareholders will also be a key feature for the remainder of the year, with Aflac still seeing buybacks of somewhere from $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion for 2018 in total.Aflac investors took the news in stride, and the stock didn't move much in after-hours trading following the announcement. Investors in insurance companies tend to like predictability in their investments, so the solid results that Aflac has been able to produce over the years are exactly what many of the insurance company's shareholders want to hear quarter after quarter.

The plane, a turbo-propeller Bombardier Q400 operated by Alaska Air Group subsidiary of Horizon Air, then crashed into Ketron Island, a small inland island roughly 30 miles south near Tacoma, Wash. There were reportedly no passengers on the plane.Local authorities described the 29-year-old hijacker as suicidal, the AP reported. Jimmy Thomson, deputy editor of Canadian investigative news outlet The Narwhal, has compiled and transcribed portions of the air-traffic recording of the incident, and they provide a haunting glimpse into the moments before the plane crash.Read More: Alaska Air Suicide Flight Highlights Gaps in Airport SecurityThe hijacker is referred to in the recordings as “Rich.” In one key passage, “Rich” – sounding notably composed – seemed to confirm his suicidal mindset, saying: “I’ve got a lot of people that care about me. It’s going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. I would like to apologize to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose I guess.

At one point he seems to be threatening harm, telling an air traffic controller that “people’s lives are at stake here.” There are also significant signs of premeditation, with the thief at one point saying “I wasn’t really planning on landing” the plane.He sounds very emotional here. #seatac pic.twitter.com/eZAuuC5RNa— Jimmy Thomson (@jwsthomson) August 11, 2018 Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.“Rich” also provides vague hints toward economic and racial grievances.

He expresses confidence in his handling of the plane, citing experience with video games. But he repeatedly refuses to land the plane, and returns multiple times to the idea of doing a barrel roll in the passenger plane.

ALGN has made an extension to its Invisalign clear aligner range with the latest launch of Vivera Retainers with Precision Bite Ramps. This is claimed to be the first-of-its retainers in the market, which can be customized to provide additional support after a deep bite correction.Notably, Vivera retainer is made with the same state-of-the-art technology as Invisalign aligners. It employs 3-D digital imaging, proprietary clear thermoplastic material and advanced fabrication technology for a stronger retention with a precise, comfortable fit.Per Align, Precision Bite Ramps were first introduced in 2014 and are designed to disocclude the posterior teeth or “open the bite”. This improves efficiency in deep bite Invisalign treatments. Since Precision Bite Ramps are part of Invisalign G5, its integration with Vivera Retainers is expected to bring greater clinical success for Align in the orthodontic space.With deep bite malocclusion gradually becoming a very common orthodontic occurrence worldwide, we consider this development a major breakthrough for Align with respect to customer adoption. The rate of deep bite malocclusion cases is mostly high in North America and EMEA, registering 45% of patients from those regions.According to statistics provided by Align, till date, more than 688,000 moderate or severe deep bite patients (including over 185,000 teenagers) have been treated with Invisalign clear aligners. Patient data also showed that doctors are increasingly fixing severe deep bites with Invisalign G5 Precision Bite Ramps.It is important to note that Align has recently undertaken several strategies to improve adoption of Invisalign Technology globally including product/technology development, extending clinical effectiveness, expansion of the Invisalign Technology brand and driving international growth. In a parallel press release today, the company has introduced an expanded Invisalign product portfolio offering new options and greater flexibility to a wider range of patients. Earlier, the company had introduced a clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC. These are indicative of the growing popularity of Align’s dental products in the international market. Over the long term, we expect G6, G7 and similar innovations to act as major catalysts for Align in the new as well as the existing markets. Over the past six months, shares of Align have outperformed its industry. The stock has surged 33.1% compared with the 2.1% increase of the industry.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAlign carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Recognizing whether CEO incentives are aligned with shareholders is a crucial part of investing. Incentives can be in the form of compensation, which should always be structured in a way that promotes value-creation to shareholders. I will break down Kapoor’s pay and compare this to the company’s performance over the same period, as well as measure it against other Indian CEOs leading companies of similar size and profitability.  See our latest analysis for Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals  Earnings is a powerful indication of CHAMBLFERT’s ability to invest shareholders’ funds and generate returns. Therefore I will use earnings as a proxy of Kapoor’s performance in the past year. Most recently, CHAMBLFERT released a profit of ₹4.95b , which is an increase of 29.19% from its prior year’s earnings of ₹3.83b. This is a positive indication that CHAMBLFERT has strived to maintain a good track record of profitability in the face of any headwinds. Since earnings are heading towards the right direction, CEO pay should be reflective of Kapoor’s value creation for shareholders. During the same period, Kapoor’s total compensation increased by 11.54% to ₹42.45m.Though one size does not fit all, as remuneration should be tailored to the specific company and market, we can evaluate a high-level base line to see if CHAMBLFERT deviates substantially from its peers. This exercise helps investors ask the right question about Kapoor’s incentive alignment. Normally, a BSE or NSEI small-cap is worth around ₹9.88b, produces earnings of ₹430m, and remunerates its CEO circa ₹7.3m annually. Allowing for CHAMBLFERT’s size and performance, in terms of market cap and earnings, it appears that Kapoor is paid in-line with the average BSE and NSEI small-cap CEO This could mean Kapoor is paid a suitable level.CEO pay is one of those topics of high controversy. Nonetheless, it should be talked about with full transparency from the board to shareholders. Is Kapoor remunerated appropriately based on other factors we have not covered today? Is this justified? As a shareholder, you should be aware of how those that represent you (i.e. the board of directors) make decisions on CEO pay and whether their incentives are aligned with yours.

While recent generations have abandoned or entirely avoided Sears stores, the company was an early innovator in U.S. retail, a godsend to heartland shoppers a century ago, and arguably a more dominant force in the retail industry than Amazon is today.Here is a look back at the timeline of Sears’ dramatic rise and fall.Richard Sears, who was born into a wealthy Minnesota family that lost its fortune in a speculative stock deal, was working as a station agent in 1866 when he began selling watches in a side business named “R.W. Sears Watch Co.” Sears meets a watch repairman named Alvah Roebuck, and together they expand the company into selling diamonds and jewelry.After selling the first business, Sears moves to Chicago in 1892 and establishes a second mail-order company, renaming it Sears, Roebuck & Co. in 1893. The catalog business offers a much larger inventory and lower prices than rural shoppers are used to paying in local general stores.Sears listed shares in a public offering in 1906, the same year that it opened a catalog plant and the Sears Merchandise Building Tower, the first building in what would become a huge, 40-acre office complex. Richard Sears would step down as president the following year due to declining health. He died in 1914. Goldman Sachs managed the Sears’ IPO.On the west side of Chicago, Sears opens its first retail store inside a mail-order plant, including an optical shop and a soda fountain. Meanwhile, the Sears catalog, sometimes known to all customers as the “wish book,” would eventually grow as large as 1,000 pages. By 1930, Sears would operate 300 retail outlets.Sears pays $500 for the rights to the Craftsman brand in 1927, which would become known for high-quality tools. The Kenmore name begins appearing on washing machines the same year. The two brands would join Allstate, DieHard, and Toughskins as brand names familiar to Sears customers over the decades.Sears completes the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago, moving its headquarters for the first time in a half-century. In the interim, Sears has expanded into countries like Mexico, while becoming a flagship retailer in malls across the U.S.Sears expands into financial services in 1981 by buying stockbroker Dean Witter Reynolds and real estate company Coldwell Banker. During the next two years, Sears would introduce the Discover credit card and partner with IBM on Prodigy, one of the earliest online services.In the late 70s and early 80s, Sears’ annual revenue would reach about 1% of U.S. gross domestic product. By comparison, Amazon’s $99 billion revenue last year (excluding AWS) would equal about 0.8% of U.S. GDP.Competition from other department stores, as well as discount retailers like Kmart and Walmart, forces Sears to start slashing prices on its inventory and take other measures, such as exploring a sale of the Sears Tower and shuttering its founding catalog business. Sears would eventually spin off parts of Allstate and Dean Witter, while divesting itself of Discover, Coldwell Banker, and Prodigy. In 1990, Walmart surpassed Sears as the largest U.S. retailer.Hedge-fund investor Eddie Lampert buys control of Sears for $11 billion in 2005, after having built up a 15% stake in the company. As part of the deal, Sears merges with Kmart, which Lampert bought out of bankruptcy two years earlier.After several years of profitability, Sears begins posting losses that would escalate in time into something of a downward spiral. Sears never made the transition from an essential shopping catalog to an online retailer, ceding ground to Amazon and forcing the company to shutter store after store, lay off workers, and sell off still viable brands like Craftsman.After warning investors in 2017 of “substantial doubt” about remaining a going concern, Sears files for bankruptcy on October 15, 2018. Lampert stepped down as CEO but will remain chairman.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

While recent generations have abandoned or entirely avoided Sears stores, the company was an early innovator in U.S. retail, a godsend to heartland shoppers a century ago, and arguably a more dominant force in the retail industry than Amazon is today.Here is a look back at the timeline of Sears’ dramatic rise and fall.Richard Sears, who was born into a wealthy Minnesota family that lost its fortune in a speculative stock deal, was working as a station agent in 1866 when he began selling watches in a side business named “R.W. Sears Watch Co.” Sears meets a watch repairman named Alvah Roebuck, and together they expand the company into selling diamonds and jewelry.After selling the first business, Sears moves to Chicago in 1892 and establishes a second mail-order company, renaming it Sears, Roebuck & Co. in 1893. The catalog business offers a much larger inventory and lower prices than rural shoppers are used to paying in local general stores.Sears listed shares in a public offering in 1906, the same year that it opened a catalog plant and the Sears Merchandise Building Tower, the first building in what would become a huge, 40-acre office complex. Richard Sears would step down as president the following year due to declining health. He died in 1914. Goldman Sachs managed the Sears’ IPO.On the west side of Chicago, Sears opens its first retail store inside a mail-order plant, including an optical shop and a soda fountain. Meanwhile, the Sears catalog, sometimes known to all customers as the “wish book,” would eventually grow as large as 1,000 pages. By 1930, Sears would operate 300 retail outlets.Sears pays $500 for the rights to the Craftsman brand in 1927, which would become known for high-quality tools. The Kenmore name begins appearing on washing machines the same year. The two brands would join Allstate, DieHard, and Toughskins as brand names familiar to Sears customers over the decades.Sears completes the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago, moving its headquarters for the first time in a half-century. In the interim, Sears has expanded into countries like Mexico, while becoming a flagship retailer in malls across the U.S.Sears expands into financial services in 1981 by buying stockbroker Dean Witter Reynolds and real estate company Coldwell Banker. During the next two years, Sears would introduce the Discover credit card and partner with IBM on Prodigy, one of the earliest online services.In the late 70s and early 80s, Sears’ annual revenue would reach about 1% of U.S. gross domestic product. By comparison, Amazon’s $99 billion revenue last year (excluding AWS) would equal about 0.8% of U.S. GDP.Competition from other department stores, as well as discount retailers like Kmart and Walmart, forces Sears to start slashing prices on its inventory and take other measures, such as exploring a sale of the Sears Tower and shuttering its founding catalog business. Sears would eventually spin off parts of Allstate and Dean Witter, while divesting itself of Discover, Coldwell Banker, and Prodigy. In 1990, Walmart surpassed Sears as the largest U.S. retailer.Hedge-fund investor Eddie Lampert buys control of Sears for $11 billion in 2005, after having built up a 15% stake in the company. As part of the deal, Sears merges with Kmart, which Lampert bought out of bankruptcy two years earlier.After several years of profitability, Sears begins posting losses that would escalate in time into something of a downward spiral. Sears never made the transition from an essential shopping catalog to an online retailer, ceding ground to Amazon and forcing the company to shutter store after store, lay off workers, and sell off still viable brands like Craftsman.After warning investors in 2017 of “substantial doubt” about remaining a going concern, Sears files for bankruptcy on October 15, 2018. Lampert stepped down as CEO but will remain chairman.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

The glass is made by Corning, which Apple has invested in. Turns out, in the four tests SquareTrade performed, including a test where the new phones took a spin in a tumbler, Apple's phones broke nearly every time they were subjected to stress. Both the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max broke when dropped on their backs from 6 feet, and both phones failed when they were bent by a machine.But when dropped face down, the iPhone XS Max proved to be more durable than its smaller sibling. While the screen shattered, the iPhone XS Max touchscreen was still usable. The smaller phone's screen did not work. Youtube Embed: //www.youtube.com/embed/Qzf-eaugEtY?ecver=1 Width: 804px Height: 452pxThat's why SquareTrade gave the iPhone XS Max a better durability score of 70, or ""medium risk,"" compared to the iPhone XS's score of 86, which the insurer considers ""high risk.""Both improve on the now-discontinued iPhone X, which scored a 90 in last year's SquareTrade test and was called the ""most breakable iPhone ever."" SquareTrade, owned by Allstate, uses these tests as a way to sell insurance plans for the new iPhone. If you don't have insurance or AppleCare, repairing the iPhone XS screen is $279, and any other damage — like a cracked back — costs $549.A new screen for the iPhone XS Max is $329 and nearly $600 for other repairs.AppleBut if you are more likely to drop your phone in your beer or other bodies of water than on concrete, you can rest easy.

It also addresses specified categories of law if a request is properly made; “even in the absence of such request, the court has discretion to take judicial notice on its own motion.” Practice Commentaries, Vincent Alexander, CPLR 4511. Judicial notice of adjudicative-type facts is a matter of decisional law. The test is whether the fact rests upon knowledge or sources so widely accepted and unimpeachable that it need not be evidentiarily proven, such as calendar dates and geographical locations.

Appellate review is generally limited to the record made at nisi prius and, absent matters which may be judicially noticed, new facts may not be injected at the appellate level. Ghaffari v. N. Rockland Cent. School Dist., 23 A.D.3d 342 (2d Dept. 2005). Judicial notice is not limited to the trial court; it may be taken by any court at any stage of the litigation, even on appeal. Caffrey v. N. Arrow Abstract & Settlement Services, 2018 NY Slip Op. 01043 (2d Dept. 2018); Cohen v. State, 94 N.Y.2d 1 (1999). Judicial notice may be taken of a record in the same court of either the pending matter or of some other action. Chateau Rive v. Enclave Development Associates, 22 A.D.3d 445 (2d Dept. 2005). In Reed v. Wolff, 242 A.D.2d 375 (2d Dept. 1997), the Appellate Division took judicial notice of the argument regarding standing that had been addressed by the parties in a companion case. In Sam & Mary Hous. v. Jo/Sal Mkt., 100 A.D.2d 901 (2d Dept. 1984), aff’d, 64 N.Y.2d 1107 (1985), the Appellate Division upheld the trial court’s taking judicial notice of facts within its personal knowledge that affected the credibility of a witness, which knowledge had derived from an unrelated earlier case. The trial court also properly gave plaintiff the opportunity to clarify any factual inconsistencies. The Second Department took judicial notice of the circumstances surrounding a subsequent evaluation of a child, foster parents, aunt, and uncle that had been arranged without a court order, to the extent that the information was revealed in the record of a companion appeal. In re Wesley R., 307 A.D.2d 360 (2d Dept. 2003). Judicial Notice of Papers in Other Courts. In Samuels v. Montefiore Medical Center, 49 A.D.3d 268 (1st Dept. 2008), plaintiffs did not dispute the contents of an order that defendants had inadvertently failed to submit on their summary judgment motion. Even though the order was dehors-the-record, it had been included in the motion court’s files, and the court took judicial notice of it. Also, People v. Davis, 161 A.D.2d 787 (2d Dept. 1990). In granting a motion to set aside a jury verdict, the Appellate Division stated that it was “entitled” to take judicial notice of the transcript that defendants did not submit to the motion court. Santos v. National Retail Transp., 87 A.D.3d 418 (1st Dept. 2011). Judicial Notice of ‘Self Authenticating’ Bank Records. Reliability is a fundamental tenet of the rules of evidence. The following cases notwithstanding, the scams that shook the investment world should cause trepidation before a court takes judicial notice of financial-institution grade statements as purportedly “inherently trustworthy” and “self-authenticating.” In Elkaim v. Elkaim, 176 A.D.2d 116 (1st Dept. 1991), lv. dismissed, 78 N.Y.2d 1072 (1991), the Appellate Division held that “a foundation for admissibility [of business records] may at times be predicated on judicial notice of the nature of the business and the nature of the records observed by the court, particularly in the case of bank and similar statements” “when the records are so patently trustworthy as to be self-authenticating.” With no more than a “supposition” that unchallenged European bank statements had actually been created by the named banks, the Elkaim court, nevertheless, upheld the trial court’s judicial notice of the statements. Noting no more than the statements’ “appear[ance] [are] regular on their face, and in a format conforming to the type of statements with which banks customarily supply their customers on a monthly basis,” the Appellate Division surprisingly called them inherently trustworthy, self-authenticating (citing People v. Kennedy, 68 N.Y.2d 569 (1986)), reliable and immune to “serious challenge.” As late as 2014, another court, citing Elkin, upheld the admission of bank records into evidence as self-authenticating documents. MRI Enterprises v. Comprehensive Med. Care of New York, P.C., 122 A.D.3d 595 (2d Dept. 2014). Judicial Notice of Government Websites. Courts may take judicial notice of information published on an official government website. Maisto v. State, 154 A.D.3d 1248, n.4 (3d Dept. 2017); Matter of LaSonde v. Seabrook, 89 A.D.3d 132, n.8 (1st Dept. 2011), lv. den., 18 N.Y.3d 911 (2012). In Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center v. Allstate Ins. Co., 61 A.D.3d 13 (2d Dept. 2009), the Second Department stated that judicial notice has never been strictly limited to constitutions, ordinances, and regulations of government rather it has also been applied by case law to other public documents that are generated in a manner which assures their reliability such as census data, corporate dissolution certificates maintained by the State, legislative journals, the consumer price index, undisputed court records and files, and material derived from official government websites. Kingsbrook took judicial notice of diagnosis and procedure code keys available on the Health and Human Services (HHS) website, notwithstanding that the code numbers require deciphering, because it “rests upon sources widely accepted and unimpeachable,” such as reliable, authentic and uncontested governmental records. That the code system is not readily understood by the lay public is of no significance because it was offered on the basis of its reliable source and its accuracy was not contested. The government documents, in Aristy-Farer, v. State of New York, 143 A.D.3d 101 (1st Dept. 2016), compared annual education spending to demonstrate compliance with Campaign for Fiscal Equity v. State of New York, 86 NY2d 307 (1995). The First Department declined to take judicial notice of the fiscal profile spreadsheets because each consisted of tens of thousands of cells of financial data and were not readily comprehensible without explanatory expert guidance, which had not been provided. The Minute Book of the Clerk of the Court. The contents of a minute book of the Clerk of the Court are an appropriate subject of judicial notice. Based on the record, Supreme Court, in in Deal v. Meenan Oil Co., 153 A.D.2d 665 (2d Dept. 1989), properly granted plaintiffs’ motion to vacate the settlement, The ruling was reversed because, on appeal, defendant submitted documentary proof that the settlement was memorialized in the minute book of the Clerk of the Court. Discovery Motions When Judicial Notice May Taken. In Am. Re-Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 40 A.D.3d 486, n. 6 (1st Dept. 2007), the First Department disapproved of the way motion practice was conducted on the discovery issue because several of the documents were subject to judicial notice. Dehors-the-Record Official Documents, Controverted and Incontrovertible. “However well intentioned, inclusion of non-record material in a record on appeal or references to such material in briefs, on the possibility that a pending motion for enlargement of the record might be granted, is improper.” A party desirous of “enlarging the record on appeal is to make a motion to that effect.” Mount Lucas Assoc. v. MG Ref. and Mktg., 250 A.D.2d 245 (1st Dept. 1998). The Appellate Division “severely condemns” the inclusion of documents in the record on appeal which are not properly part of the record. Terner v. Terner, 44 A.D.2d 702 (2d Dept. 1974); Liebling v. Liebling, 146 A.D.2d 673 (2d Dept. 1989). A court will grant a motion to strike such offending material. Chimarios v. Duhl, 152 A.D.2d 508 (1st Dept. 1989). “It is well settled that an incontrovertible official document, [albeit] dehors-the-record, may be considered on appeal for the purposes of sustaining a judgment” O’Neill v. Board of Zoning Appeals of Town of Harrison, 225 A.D.2d 782 (2d Dept. 1996) (deeds, building permits, tax records); Brandes Meat v. Cromer, 146 A.D.2d 666 (2d Dept. 1989). A failure to dispute the accuracy of such documents concedes their accuracy. O’Neill, 225 A.D.2d 782; State v. Peerless Ins. Co., 117 A.D.2d 370 (3d Dept. 1986). During argument of the appeal, in Estate of Dwyer, 57 A.D.2d 772 (1st Dept. 1977), respondent submitted an affidavit with official documents showing that the IRS had released any federal tax lien: “For the purpose of sustaining a judgment, incontrovertible, documentary evidence dehors-the-appeal record may be received by an appellate court …” Undisputed Documents. A court may take judicial notice of undisputed court records and files. Matter of Khatibi v. Weill, 8 A.D.3d 485 (2d Dept. 2004). In Gustafson v. Dippert, 68 A.D.3d 1678, 1680 (4th Dept. 2009), defendant-Stansberry appealed from an order denying his cross-motion to disqualify the law firm from representing plaintiff based upon conflict of interest. Held: the retainer agreement between Stansberry and the firm was properly included in the record on appeal because it was undisputed that it was accurately described for the court during oral argument, for which no stenographic record was made, and the order denying Stansberry’s cross-motion listed the retainer as having been considered by the court. The Court of Appeals has also recognized “a narrow exception,” which allows the consideration on appeal of reliable documents, the existence and accuracy of which are not disputed, even to modify or reverse the order under review. Brandes Meat Corp. v. Cromer, 146 A.D.2d 666 (2d Dept. 1989), citing Crawford v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, 35 N.Y.2d 291 (1974). While a court may take judicial notice of its records and files, it “may not take judicial notice of a ‘fact’ which is controverted."" “The mere presence of a document in a court file does not mean that judicial notice can properly be taken of any factual material asserted” therein.” Walker ex rel. Velilla v. City of New York, 46 A.D.3d 278 (1st Dept. 2007). Ptasznik v. Schultz, 247 A.D.2d 197 (2d Dept. 1998) stated: “No authoritative case has ever held that an item may be considered and weighed by the finder of fact merely because the item, however unauthenticated and unreliable it may be, happened to repose in the [paperwork] of a court’s file.” In Skiff-Murray v. Murray, 305 A.D.2d 751 (3d Dept. 2003), respondent moved to strike certain judicial documents placed in an addendum to petitioner’s brief. The documents comprised subsequent findings and orders that respondent, inter alia, voluntarily departed the state and willfully disobeyed the child support order resulting in a bench warrant and order of commitment. The Appellate Division took judicial notice of those documents to the extent they established respondent’s absence and default in Family Court proceedings involving the very order from which he was seeking appellate relief. Post-judgment Changed Circumstances in Child Custody Cases. During the pendency of the appeal, in Matter of Michael B., 80 N.Y.2d 299 (1992), appellant admitted neglecting other children in his custody (not Michael), which children were removed from his home. The Court of Appeals “took notice of the new facts and allegations to the extent they indicated that the record was no longer sufficient for determining appellant’s fitness.” These events constituted new circumstances that required remittal for a new hearing. In other child custody cases, where substantial time has elapsed, coupled with the pace of the child’s psychological development, courts, citing Michael B., have found that the records were “no longer sufficient” and remitted them for new hearings. Joseph F., Sr. v. Patricia F., 32 A.D.3d 938 (2d Dept. 2006); In re Evelyse Luz S., 62 A.D.3d 595 (1st Dept. 2009).

But then the stock received its first significant upward jolt with Alphabet's stellar first-quarter 2018 report in late April, which was punctuated by strong growth in ad revenue from both Google's mobile search and YouTube platforms.IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET INC.That's not to say Alphabet's entire year went as planned. In June, the European Commission fined Google a record $2.74 billion for anti-competitive practices -- more specifically claiming that it had unfairly favored its own comparison-shopping service over those of competitors in Google search results. Google unsurprisingly disagreed with the EC's conclusion and is reportedly appealing the decision as it weighs methods to modify its products to appease regulators. But even after absorbing the fine in its entirety as a separate operating expense in the second quarter, Alphabet still managed to generate operating income of more than $3.5 billion in Q2.Most recently in late October, Alphabet stock eclipsed $1,000 per share for the first time following an even more impressive third-quarter report, including 23.7% growth in revenue to nearly $27.8 billion, and 33% growth in net income to more than $6.7 billion.Mobile and YouTube shined as relative outperformers once again, but they weren't Alphabet's only catalysts. Non-advertising revenue at Google climbed 40% year over year last quarter to more than $3.4 billion, driven by Cloud, Play, and hardware sales. And revenue from its ""Other Bets"" segment -- which includes early-stage businesses like Google Fiber high-speed internet, Nest smart-home devices, and Waymo self-driving vehicles -- rose over 53% to $302 million.Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat humbly called its latest results ""terrific,"" adding that its ""momentum is a result of investments over many years in fantastic people, products, and partnerships.""Of course, ""many years"" is a relative term for a company that was founded in 1998. But in terms of massive growth in revenue and profits from an already enormous base, it's hard to overstate the jaw-dropping momentum that Alphabet's businesses demonstrated last year. And while investors will need to wait until early February for their next quarterly update, it will be no surprise if Alphabet sustains that momentum going forward.

According to sources who spoke to Bloomberg the technology developed by Nokia could assist Google in offering a faster alternative to the Wi-Fi that currently exists on aircraft. The sources further said that the talks are at an advanced stage and a deal could be reached soon though there are no guarantees.The LTE-A2G cellular-based technology of Nokia is also capable of creating a direct connection between an airplane and the ground. This could serve as an alternative to having the signal bounce off of a satellite thus allow high-speed internet services in-cabin via Wi-Fi.For years the onboard internet has been a sore point for flyers as they have had to endure weak bandwidth and spotty service. This is despite the high prices travelers pay for in-flight internet connectivity. Thus a business opportunity exists for Google and this could also be a chance to expand its offerings.If Google succeeds in acquiring Nokia’s technology it could lead to new competition for Gogo Inc (NASDAQ:GOGO), a firm which offers in-flight internet services. Though Nokia has not stopped investing in its in-flight internet technology, for now, it is enjoying a low-priority status especially as wireless carriers intensify efforts to roll out 5G standard.The reason the communications group of Google is interested in Nokia’s technology is that its search advertising business and YouTube needs a strong internet service. Combined the ad business of Google generates close to 90% of the firm’s revenues. The communications group of Google oversees various offerings of the tech giant include the wireless business of Project Fi, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee shops Wi-Fi network and the calling service of Google Voice.This comes in the wake of the leader of Google Cloud, Diane Greene, telling employees that the firm would draft new ethical standards which would guide how its technology would be used. An internal revolt at Google led to this following revelations last month that the tech giant was partnering with the U.S. Department of Defense on a project which would analyze drone footage by use of artificial intelligence techniques.Google employees were apparently not amused by this development since such a technology could potentially be used targeting people with the aim of killing them. After the revelation Google employees numbering about 3,000 employees write to the chief executive officer of the company, Sundar Pichai, calling for the scrapping of the deal.Google, however, insisted that the partnership with the Department of Defense was only for non-offensive purposes. According to a report by Defense One Greene made the commitment of having a set of ethical guidelines drafted for purposes of guiding how Google’s technology and products could be used during a town hall she hosted. Per Greene Google will not take up such projects in future without the ethical principles in place.This article was originally posted on FX Empire Higher Gold Prices Reflect Hedge Against Uncertainty  Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 15/04/18  Bitcoin Holds on to $8,000, with $9,000 looking out of reach for now  DAX Index Fundamental Analysis – week of April 16, 2018  GBP/USD Fundamental Analysis – week of April 16, 2018  “A Fresh Fear is Lurking on Global Financial Markets” Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

GOOGL have slipped roughly 9% over the past three months as investors worry that more government intervention could be headed Google's way. With that said, Google's parent company looks poised to post strong top and bottom line Q3 growth, while it expands its products push.Recent News Google recently launched its next-generation Pixel smartphones. The new Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3XL boast an impressive camera, wireless charging, a better battery, dual front-facing cameras, and more. The new phones hope to challenge Apple’s AAPL latest iPhones. The company also sells an iPad-like tablet product called the Pixel Slate.Plus, the search engine powerhouse recently introduced its new Google Home Hub that allows users to voice-control other smart home products, such as security cameras and lights. Home Hub also features Google’s voice-assistant technology as it fights against Amazon AMZN and others in the crowded home assistant market.Investors should also note that Google is considering plans to offer its search engine in China once again. The firm famously pulled out of the world’s second-largest economy in 2010 in order to protest Chinese government censorship, among other things. But the company is reportedly in the midst of deciding whether or not to jump back into China with a tailored version of its search engine to meet Chinese government censorship standards.OverviewGoogle is coming off a quarter that saw its total revenues surge 26% to reach $32.65 billion.The firm that claims roughly 37% of the total U.S. digital advertising market—ahead of Facebook’s FB 20%—posted 24% growth in Q2 ad revenues.Meanwhile, Alphabet’s “Google other revenues” category, which is comprised of the Google Play Store, Google Cloud offerings, and its hardware initiatives, surged over 36% to touch $4.43 billion.Moving on, shares of Google have performed far worse over the last year than some of its tech behemoth peers, such as Amazon and Apple. In fact, GOOGL stock is up roughly 9.5% during the last 12 months, which falls just below the S&P 500’s 10% climb.Google stock has, however, outperformed its industry’s 14% decline. Plus, GOOGL’s recent dip has its stock price resting roughly 15% below its 52-week high. This might set up a solid buying opportunity ahead of its Q3 earnings release.  Q3 Outlook Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Google’s Q3 revenues to climb by approximately 22.4% to reach $27.25 billion. Looking a bit further ahead, the firm is expected to see its fiscal year revenues hit $109.6 billion, which would represent a 22.9% jump.At the other end of the income statement, Alphabet’s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 9.7% to hit $10.50 per share. Meanwhile, the firm’s adjusted EPS figure is expected to expand by 24% in fiscal 2018.Bottom Line Alphabet has seen its earnings estimates trend upward for fiscal 2018 over the last 30 days, but its Q3 revisions have moved in the opposite direction. These mixed earnings revision trends help Alphabet land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment.The firm does currently sport an “A” grade for Growth and a “B” for Momentum in our Style Scores system, and might be worth considering before it releases its Q3 earnings.Alphabet is scheduled to report its third quarter 2018 financial results on Thursday, October 25.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

But investors don't give the iGiant anywhere near the same level of respect as its largest tech peers.Apple is trading at an average 40% discount to Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)! And it's pretty much always been this way.AAPL PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsBut why is this the case?Some investors have resigned themselves to this reality. Others have very plausible excuses:Apple's simply too big for its own good.Apple isn't growing as fast as the other three.But while these make sense on the surface level, I simply don't think they explain the heart of the matter. There's only one plausible explanation: Apple's moat is nowhere near as wide as those of the other three, and the market knows it.It's true, Apple is the largest, most valuable company the world has ever known. With a bump of just 10%, it would become the history's first trillion-dollar organization. But while the law of large numbers does make sense on paper, Apple's not so big compared to its peers that it should necessitate such a discount.If you look at the top ten largest stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, all three of these peers sit in the top six.Data source: Finviz.comIt's also worth stating that just because a company is approaching a landmark like $1 trillion, it doesn't mean it can't stop growing from there. Indeed, because the stock market has always gone up over the long-run, all-time barriers are routinely broken. There's no reason Apple couldn't keep growing.Others will argue that Apple is simply not growing as fast as its tech peers. While that's true with Facebook, it isn't with Microsoft or Alphabet.MetricAppleAlphabetMicrosoftFacebook3-Year Revenue CAGR8%17%3%48%3-Year EPS CAGR13%9%11%53%Data source: E*Trade, SEC filings. CAGR = Compounded Annual Growth Rate. EPS figures calculated using non-GAAP figures when applicable.While Facebook is growing demonstrably faster, Apple's earnings growth has outpaced Alphabet (surprise!), and it has Microsoft beat on both top and bottom lines.And yet Apple still trades at a 40%+ discount.Before getting into the weeds, it's important we define our terms. A ""moat"" is another word for an enduring competitive advantage. In the simplest sense, a moat is what keeps customers (or users) coming back to a single company year after year, and holding the competition at bay for decades.Image source: Getty ImagesThere are four key types of economic moats, and while each company has elements of multiple moats in its business model, a single moat dominates. For the purposes of this article, that's convenient.Network Effect: I consider this the strongest of all moats. With each additional user, the value of a network becomes greater, further incentivizing more users to join. This is Facebook's key moat. As each user joins the network, others are incentivized to join, creating a virtuous cycle.High Switching Costs: If a customer will need to pay dearly to switch away from a service -- in terms of direct costs, time, or headaches in general -- they are more likely to stick with the incumbent. This is Microsoft's key moat. Users the world over have been using the Office Suite -- Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.-- for over two decades. This reliable income helps fund other initiatives.Low-Cost Production: If a company can offer a product or service for markedly lower costs than the competition -- with the same or greater value -- it will be the provider of choice. This is Alphabet's key moat. Remember, Google makes most of its money on advertising. Because it has seven products with over one billion users each -- search, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Chrome, Android, and Play Store -- it has tons of data that it gets just for maintaining these properties. Advertisers pay hand over fist for that data.Intangible Assets: This includes things like brand value, patents, and regulatory protection. This is Apple's key moat. Its brand is the most valuable in the world, and patents on in-house developed chips are a key differentiator.No moat will ever mean that a business is safe forever. As Arjun Sethi -- co-founder and CEO of MessageMe -- recently wrote: ""A moat simply buys a company time to figure out the next great business."" [emphasis in original].Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook have business models with uber-wide moats around them. It would take a herculean effort to create a social network with as much stickiness as Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp (and not get bought out by Facebook). Someone would need to wrest ""Google it"" from our lexicon to break the stranglehold that Alphabet has on our search data. And competitors have been trying for decades to create a better Excel spreadsheet.Those advantages give the leaders of these businesses an enormous head-start on figuring out the Next Big Thing.There's no questioning Apple's status in the industry. But it has to count on its users continually upgrading to the next iPhone to remain relevant. That's not exactly an enduring advantage when viewed against the protection that Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft enjoy.Don't get me wrong -- I'm an Apple shareholder myself. The company has done a great job of introducing high switching-costs via the iCloud, and it benefits from the network effect of third-party app developers building on its iOS. Its efforts in providing services have also been hugely successful.But for now, it is predominantly an iPhone maker. And it is priced accordingly. I think the price is fair -- which is why I'm holding my shares. But I have no illusions of it ever consistently trading above a P/E of 20. You shouldn't either.

Shareholders seem satisifed with the arrangement.But Alphabet is so powerful, and the decisions it makes will have such far-reaching effects, that Page should take more time to communicate with stakeholders beyond the confines of the company's walls.Who speaks for Alphabet GOOGL these days?Mark Zuckerberg is the face of Facebook FB . Jeff Bezos is definitely in charge of Amazon AMZN . Tim Cook runs Apple AAPL . Satya Nadella speaks for Microsoft MSFT .The CEO of Alphabet is Larry Page, who co-founded the company (then called Google) with Sergey Brin in 1998.Page has always been an introvert. He's never liked earnings calls, and stopped doing them in 2013. He hasn't given a keynote at the company's big annual developers' conference, I/O, since 2012. He barely speaks to the press or talks in public: There was a burst of activity in 2014, when he sat for an interview with the FT , spoke at TED , and did a fireside chat with Brin and venture capitalist Vinod Khosla . He also showed up at a Fortune conference in 2015 . That's about it.But times have changed since 2015. The tech industry is under greater scrutiny than it's ever faced.Larry Page is the chief executive of a $740 billion conglomerate whose main division, Google, has a mission statement to ""organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.""That's precisely what people are concerned about -- the responsibility that comes with collecting, storing and analyzing massive amounts of information. How should that information be used? Who gets to decide?Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have so far borne the brunt of the rising public concern over these questions, thanks to the Cambridge Analytica data leak and that firm's connections to President Trump. But insiders tell us that a lot of people at Google -- which collects just as much or more information than Facebook -- are scared of being dragged through the mud next.What does Larry Page think of all this? Is he worried?Sundar Pichai is CEO of company-within-a-company now known as Google, which includes all of Alphabet's most important and profitable businesses like search, ads, cloud computing, enterprise software, YouTube, Android, Chrome...basically everything but the far-out futuristic stuff that doesn't make money. Pichai, also an Alphabet board member, often talks about turning Google into an AI company, where artificial intelligence is at the center of everything it does.But AI goes beyond Google. It's used by Waymo's self-driving cars and some of the health-tech solutions being proposed by Verily. Alphabet's growth investment arm, CapitalG, even shares some of Google's AI expertise with its portfolio companies in a multi-day bootcamp .What does Page think about AI? What are his concerns? What safeguards, if any, would he advocate?Unlike other tech leaders such as Elon Musk and Bill Gates , Page has been silent.Meanwhile, several thousand Alphabet employees have reportedly signed a petition protesting the company's willingness to provide AI technology to a Defense Department drone initiative called Project Maven. About a dozen employees quit, according to Gizmodo and sources familiar.Google Cloud CEO and Alphabet board member Diane Greene reportedly defended Google's decision to participate in Maven.Was Larry Page in favor of Maven as well?Last year, employees staged a walkout over Trump's proposed changes to immigration policy. Pichai and Brin, both immigrants, gave stirring speeches during a massive employee rally over the issue.Page did not.Last year, when the federal government accused Alphabet of systematically underpaying women , Alphabet spokespeople were ready with statements calling the accusations untrue.Page said nothing.Recently, Google made a change to its employee code of conduct: It removed the words ""don't be evil,"" which had been there since 2001.It had already removed those words from its corporate motto in 2016, replacing them with ""do the right thing."" But Gizmodo noticed on Friday the code of conduct had quietly been changed some time in April or May. It's now full of generic corporate language like ""highest ethical standards"" and ""respect.""Pichai makes the decisions for Google, but Page helped create Google and its culture. What does he think of this?Page lets CFO and former Morgan Stanley exec Ruth Porat be the company's liaison to Wall Street. He didn't talk about fact that the company is no longer the second-most valuable tech company after Apple -- it fell behind Amazon in March of this year. It is now hovering around the same level as Microsoft, which hasn't happened since 2012.He had no statement on Eric Schmidt stepping down from the executive chairman spot in December , even though Schmidt was CEO of the company for 10 years as it grew from scrappy start-up to one of the most powerful entities in the world.For that matter, he hasn't said anything about the debate around technology addiction , the role of tech platforms like Google News and YouTube in spreading misinformation , or the role of big tech in media consolidation .The last public appearance Page made was a deposition in a trial where Waymo, formerly the Google self-driving car project, was suing ride-sharing company Uber in an intellectual property dispute. Page gave a deposition last July, but he seemed to have trouble remembering a lot of details, and Uber asked the judge to make him come back to the stand. (The companies settled in February, and Page did not return to the stand.)Larry Page may be able to ignore shareholders -- he, Brin, and Schmidt have unchallenged voting control thanks to the company's multiple share classes and the acquiescence of common shareholders, who seem satisfied with the company's performance.Insiders say that one of the motivations behind the Alphabet reorganization was to give Page good reason to stay out of the limelight, since Pichai now leads the most important company, Google.But as the tech industry becomes the power center of the modern world, hiding from the public is no longer appropriate. These aren't start-ups, and their CEOs aren't awkward teenagers. They shouldn't be allowed to hide in their bedrooms, slipping a letter through the door every couple of years.Facebook's Zuckerberg was silent when the Cambridge Analytica scandal first broke, but eventually apologized multiple times, then spent two days testifying before Congress about how his company uses information it collects about users.Apple's Cook has slammed the entire business model of selling ads around information collected from users, with quips like ""We can make a ton of money if customers were our product. We have elected not to do that.""Microsoft's Nadella hasn't been as critical of the tech industry approach to data privacy, but he speaks often about the company's larger responsibility to society. Amazon's Bezos has been mostly quiet about information-gathering, but has publicized his donations to advocacy groups on other social issues like marriage equality and immigration policy.What does the leader of one of the most powerful companies in the world believe? Does he care about his company's effect on society? Does he believe Alphabet is a force for good? Does he ever have doubts about the data-driven cash machine he's created?Was Larry Page OK with removing ""don't be evil"" from the employee code of conduct of the company he co-founded?We asked these questions, but Page and the company declined to respond for this article. We'll let you know if they have anything more to say.More From CNBC The Obamas are heading to NetflixCritics say big tech is 'mostly useless' —but some tech has changed my lifeMicron shares surge after chipmaker raises its guidanceTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

At the close, Amazon's market cap was about $5 billion greater than Alphabet's. In doing so, Amazon is now the second-most-valuable company in the world behind Apple.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts.While the two companies' market caps are comparable, it's worth remembering that Amazon and the Google parent are still worlds apart in fundamentals.For starters, here are some fundamental metrics for how Amazon and Alphabet fared last year.Metric (TTM)AmazonAlphabetRevenue$177.9 billion$110.9 billionOperating income$4.1 billion$26.1 billionNet income$3 billion$12.7 billionOperating margin2.3%23.6%Net margin1.7%11.4%Free cash flow$8.4 billion$23.9 billionData source: SEC filings. TTM = trailing 12 month.Amazon has long had notoriously thin margins, due to the fact that e-commerce is inherently less profitable combined with Amazon's unrivaled willingness to reinvest in its business. That explains why its margins are so low, as well as why its free cash flow is substantially less than Alphabet's. Amazon's capital expenditures are primarily related to fulfillment infrastructure like warehouses and distribution facilities, while Alphabet's spending includes a lot of network infrastructure like data centers.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Image source: Amazon.The differences in key fundamental metrics point to vastly different valuation ratios, as investors are pricing in much more optimistic expectations into Amazon's future.Valuation MetricAmazonAlphabetP/E (TTM)337.534.3P/S (TTM)4.26.9P/FCF (TTM)54.526P/B (MRQ)275Data source: Reuters. TTM = trailing 12 month. MRQ = most recent quarter.There are also major differences in terms of where each company is looking to expand going forward.Amazon appears to want to disrupt every conceivable industry on Earth, from grocery shopping to healthcare to banking. There are even rumors that the company is preparing to become a major hospital supplier. Whether or not Amazon will be profitable in those endeavors is a different question altogether, and investors may have to wait years for those moves to pay off, if they do at all. But that's par for the course when it comes to Amazon.Meanwhile, Google is expected to start seeing its share of the U.S. ad market slip in the years ahead, although the company is also pushing deeper into hardware in order to better compete with Apple by using the same strategy of integrating hardware and software. That includes its lineup of smart speakers, which looks like an increasingly important battleground.

The NYSE trading suspension highlights the complexity of the fragmented market, but also its resiliency, given that stocks can trade elsewhere when one exchange has a problem.The NYSE is one of last U.S. exchanges to have a physical trading floor, and prior to April 9, only securities that were listed on the exchange could be traded there. But following a recent technology upgrade, the NYSE said it would begin trading securities listed on other exchanges as well.The trading suspension was not likely related to the technology upgrade, Kaus said.In March, the NYSE and two of its affiliate exchanges were fined $14 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, partly in response to a nearly four-hour trading halt in July 2015 that was the result of a flawed software roll out.(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak and John McCrank; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

But then the stock received its first significant upward jolt with Alphabet's stellar first-quarter 2018 report in late April, which was punctuated by strong growth in ad revenue from both Google's mobile search and YouTube platforms.IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET INC.That's not to say Alphabet's entire year went as planned. In June, the European Commission fined Google a record $2.74 billion for anti-competitive practices -- more specifically claiming that it had unfairly favored its own comparison-shopping service over those of competitors in Google search results. Google unsurprisingly disagreed with the EC's conclusion and is reportedly appealing the decision as it weighs methods to modify its products to appease regulators. But even after absorbing the fine in its entirety as a separate operating expense in the second quarter, Alphabet still managed to generate operating income of more than $3.5 billion in Q2.Most recently in late October, Alphabet stock eclipsed $1,000 per share for the first time following an even more impressive third-quarter report, including 23.7% growth in revenue to nearly $27.8 billion, and 33% growth in net income to more than $6.7 billion.Mobile and YouTube shined as relative outperformers once again, but they weren't Alphabet's only catalysts. Non-advertising revenue at Google climbed 40% year over year last quarter to more than $3.4 billion, driven by Cloud, Play, and hardware sales. And revenue from its ""Other Bets"" segment -- which includes early-stage businesses like Google Fiber high-speed internet, Nest smart-home devices, and Waymo self-driving vehicles -- rose over 53% to $302 million.Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat humbly called its latest results ""terrific,"" adding that its ""momentum is a result of investments over many years in fantastic people, products, and partnerships.""Of course, ""many years"" is a relative term for a company that was founded in 1998. But in terms of massive growth in revenue and profits from an already enormous base, it's hard to overstate the jaw-dropping momentum that Alphabet's businesses demonstrated last year. And while investors will need to wait until early February for their next quarterly update, it will be no surprise if Alphabet sustains that momentum going forward.

According to sources who spoke to Bloomberg the technology developed by Nokia could assist Google in offering a faster alternative to the Wi-Fi that currently exists on aircraft. The sources further said that the talks are at an advanced stage and a deal could be reached soon though there are no guarantees.The LTE-A2G cellular-based technology of Nokia is also capable of creating a direct connection between an airplane and the ground. This could serve as an alternative to having the signal bounce off of a satellite thus allow high-speed internet services in-cabin via Wi-Fi.For years the onboard internet has been a sore point for flyers as they have had to endure weak bandwidth and spotty service. This is despite the high prices travelers pay for in-flight internet connectivity. Thus a business opportunity exists for Google and this could also be a chance to expand its offerings.If Google succeeds in acquiring Nokia’s technology it could lead to new competition for Gogo Inc (NASDAQ:GOGO), a firm which offers in-flight internet services. Though Nokia has not stopped investing in its in-flight internet technology, for now, it is enjoying a low-priority status especially as wireless carriers intensify efforts to roll out 5G standard.The reason the communications group of Google is interested in Nokia’s technology is that its search advertising business and YouTube needs a strong internet service. Combined the ad business of Google generates close to 90% of the firm’s revenues. The communications group of Google oversees various offerings of the tech giant include the wireless business of Project Fi, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee shops Wi-Fi network and the calling service of Google Voice.This comes in the wake of the leader of Google Cloud, Diane Greene, telling employees that the firm would draft new ethical standards which would guide how its technology would be used. An internal revolt at Google led to this following revelations last month that the tech giant was partnering with the U.S. Department of Defense on a project which would analyze drone footage by use of artificial intelligence techniques.Google employees were apparently not amused by this development since such a technology could potentially be used targeting people with the aim of killing them. After the revelation Google employees numbering about 3,000 employees write to the chief executive officer of the company, Sundar Pichai, calling for the scrapping of the deal.Google, however, insisted that the partnership with the Department of Defense was only for non-offensive purposes. According to a report by Defense One Greene made the commitment of having a set of ethical guidelines drafted for purposes of guiding how Google’s technology and products could be used during a town hall she hosted. Per Greene Google will not take up such projects in future without the ethical principles in place.This article was originally posted on FX Empire Higher Gold Prices Reflect Hedge Against Uncertainty  Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 15/04/18  Bitcoin Holds on to $8,000, with $9,000 looking out of reach for now  DAX Index Fundamental Analysis – week of April 16, 2018  GBP/USD Fundamental Analysis – week of April 16, 2018  “A Fresh Fear is Lurking on Global Financial Markets” Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

GOOGL have slipped roughly 9% over the past three months as investors worry that more government intervention could be headed Google's way. With that said, Google's parent company looks poised to post strong top and bottom line Q3 growth, while it expands its products push.Recent News Google recently launched its next-generation Pixel smartphones. The new Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3XL boast an impressive camera, wireless charging, a better battery, dual front-facing cameras, and more. The new phones hope to challenge Apple’s AAPL latest iPhones. The company also sells an iPad-like tablet product called the Pixel Slate.Plus, the search engine powerhouse recently introduced its new Google Home Hub that allows users to voice-control other smart home products, such as security cameras and lights. Home Hub also features Google’s voice-assistant technology as it fights against Amazon AMZN and others in the crowded home assistant market.Investors should also note that Google is considering plans to offer its search engine in China once again. The firm famously pulled out of the world’s second-largest economy in 2010 in order to protest Chinese government censorship, among other things. But the company is reportedly in the midst of deciding whether or not to jump back into China with a tailored version of its search engine to meet Chinese government censorship standards.OverviewGoogle is coming off a quarter that saw its total revenues surge 26% to reach $32.65 billion.The firm that claims roughly 37% of the total U.S. digital advertising market—ahead of Facebook’s FB 20%—posted 24% growth in Q2 ad revenues.Meanwhile, Alphabet’s “Google other revenues” category, which is comprised of the Google Play Store, Google Cloud offerings, and its hardware initiatives, surged over 36% to touch $4.43 billion.Moving on, shares of Google have performed far worse over the last year than some of its tech behemoth peers, such as Amazon and Apple. In fact, GOOGL stock is up roughly 9.5% during the last 12 months, which falls just below the S&P 500’s 10% climb.Google stock has, however, outperformed its industry’s 14% decline. Plus, GOOGL’s recent dip has its stock price resting roughly 15% below its 52-week high. This might set up a solid buying opportunity ahead of its Q3 earnings release.  Q3 Outlook Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Google’s Q3 revenues to climb by approximately 22.4% to reach $27.25 billion. Looking a bit further ahead, the firm is expected to see its fiscal year revenues hit $109.6 billion, which would represent a 22.9% jump.At the other end of the income statement, Alphabet’s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 9.7% to hit $10.50 per share. Meanwhile, the firm’s adjusted EPS figure is expected to expand by 24% in fiscal 2018.Bottom Line Alphabet has seen its earnings estimates trend upward for fiscal 2018 over the last 30 days, but its Q3 revisions have moved in the opposite direction. These mixed earnings revision trends help Alphabet land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment.The firm does currently sport an “A” grade for Growth and a “B” for Momentum in our Style Scores system, and might be worth considering before it releases its Q3 earnings.Alphabet is scheduled to report its third quarter 2018 financial results on Thursday, October 25.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

But investors don't give the iGiant anywhere near the same level of respect as its largest tech peers.Apple is trading at an average 40% discount to Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)! And it's pretty much always been this way.AAPL PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsBut why is this the case?Some investors have resigned themselves to this reality. Others have very plausible excuses:Apple's simply too big for its own good.Apple isn't growing as fast as the other three.But while these make sense on the surface level, I simply don't think they explain the heart of the matter. There's only one plausible explanation: Apple's moat is nowhere near as wide as those of the other three, and the market knows it.It's true, Apple is the largest, most valuable company the world has ever known. With a bump of just 10%, it would become the history's first trillion-dollar organization. But while the law of large numbers does make sense on paper, Apple's not so big compared to its peers that it should necessitate such a discount.If you look at the top ten largest stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, all three of these peers sit in the top six.Data source: Finviz.comIt's also worth stating that just because a company is approaching a landmark like $1 trillion, it doesn't mean it can't stop growing from there. Indeed, because the stock market has always gone up over the long-run, all-time barriers are routinely broken. There's no reason Apple couldn't keep growing.Others will argue that Apple is simply not growing as fast as its tech peers. While that's true with Facebook, it isn't with Microsoft or Alphabet.MetricAppleAlphabetMicrosoftFacebook3-Year Revenue CAGR8%17%3%48%3-Year EPS CAGR13%9%11%53%Data source: E*Trade, SEC filings. CAGR = Compounded Annual Growth Rate. EPS figures calculated using non-GAAP figures when applicable.While Facebook is growing demonstrably faster, Apple's earnings growth has outpaced Alphabet (surprise!), and it has Microsoft beat on both top and bottom lines.And yet Apple still trades at a 40%+ discount.Before getting into the weeds, it's important we define our terms. A ""moat"" is another word for an enduring competitive advantage. In the simplest sense, a moat is what keeps customers (or users) coming back to a single company year after year, and holding the competition at bay for decades.Image source: Getty ImagesThere are four key types of economic moats, and while each company has elements of multiple moats in its business model, a single moat dominates. For the purposes of this article, that's convenient.Network Effect: I consider this the strongest of all moats. With each additional user, the value of a network becomes greater, further incentivizing more users to join. This is Facebook's key moat. As each user joins the network, others are incentivized to join, creating a virtuous cycle.High Switching Costs: If a customer will need to pay dearly to switch away from a service -- in terms of direct costs, time, or headaches in general -- they are more likely to stick with the incumbent. This is Microsoft's key moat. Users the world over have been using the Office Suite -- Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.-- for over two decades. This reliable income helps fund other initiatives.Low-Cost Production: If a company can offer a product or service for markedly lower costs than the competition -- with the same or greater value -- it will be the provider of choice. This is Alphabet's key moat. Remember, Google makes most of its money on advertising. Because it has seven products with over one billion users each -- search, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Chrome, Android, and Play Store -- it has tons of data that it gets just for maintaining these properties. Advertisers pay hand over fist for that data.Intangible Assets: This includes things like brand value, patents, and regulatory protection. This is Apple's key moat. Its brand is the most valuable in the world, and patents on in-house developed chips are a key differentiator.No moat will ever mean that a business is safe forever. As Arjun Sethi -- co-founder and CEO of MessageMe -- recently wrote: ""A moat simply buys a company time to figure out the next great business."" [emphasis in original].Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook have business models with uber-wide moats around them. It would take a herculean effort to create a social network with as much stickiness as Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp (and not get bought out by Facebook). Someone would need to wrest ""Google it"" from our lexicon to break the stranglehold that Alphabet has on our search data. And competitors have been trying for decades to create a better Excel spreadsheet.Those advantages give the leaders of these businesses an enormous head-start on figuring out the Next Big Thing.There's no questioning Apple's status in the industry. But it has to count on its users continually upgrading to the next iPhone to remain relevant. That's not exactly an enduring advantage when viewed against the protection that Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft enjoy.Don't get me wrong -- I'm an Apple shareholder myself. The company has done a great job of introducing high switching-costs via the iCloud, and it benefits from the network effect of third-party app developers building on its iOS. Its efforts in providing services have also been hugely successful.But for now, it is predominantly an iPhone maker. And it is priced accordingly. I think the price is fair -- which is why I'm holding my shares. But I have no illusions of it ever consistently trading above a P/E of 20. You shouldn't either.

Shareholders seem satisifed with the arrangement.But Alphabet is so powerful, and the decisions it makes will have such far-reaching effects, that Page should take more time to communicate with stakeholders beyond the confines of the company's walls.Who speaks for Alphabet GOOGL these days?Mark Zuckerberg is the face of Facebook FB . Jeff Bezos is definitely in charge of Amazon AMZN . Tim Cook runs Apple AAPL . Satya Nadella speaks for Microsoft MSFT .The CEO of Alphabet is Larry Page, who co-founded the company (then called Google) with Sergey Brin in 1998.Page has always been an introvert. He's never liked earnings calls, and stopped doing them in 2013. He hasn't given a keynote at the company's big annual developers' conference, I/O, since 2012. He barely speaks to the press or talks in public: There was a burst of activity in 2014, when he sat for an interview with the FT , spoke at TED , and did a fireside chat with Brin and venture capitalist Vinod Khosla . He also showed up at a Fortune conference in 2015 . That's about it.But times have changed since 2015. The tech industry is under greater scrutiny than it's ever faced.Larry Page is the chief executive of a $740 billion conglomerate whose main division, Google, has a mission statement to ""organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.""That's precisely what people are concerned about -- the responsibility that comes with collecting, storing and analyzing massive amounts of information. How should that information be used? Who gets to decide?Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have so far borne the brunt of the rising public concern over these questions, thanks to the Cambridge Analytica data leak and that firm's connections to President Trump. But insiders tell us that a lot of people at Google -- which collects just as much or more information than Facebook -- are scared of being dragged through the mud next.What does Larry Page think of all this? Is he worried?Sundar Pichai is CEO of company-within-a-company now known as Google, which includes all of Alphabet's most important and profitable businesses like search, ads, cloud computing, enterprise software, YouTube, Android, Chrome...basically everything but the far-out futuristic stuff that doesn't make money. Pichai, also an Alphabet board member, often talks about turning Google into an AI company, where artificial intelligence is at the center of everything it does.But AI goes beyond Google. It's used by Waymo's self-driving cars and some of the health-tech solutions being proposed by Verily. Alphabet's growth investment arm, CapitalG, even shares some of Google's AI expertise with its portfolio companies in a multi-day bootcamp .What does Page think about AI? What are his concerns? What safeguards, if any, would he advocate?Unlike other tech leaders such as Elon Musk and Bill Gates , Page has been silent.Meanwhile, several thousand Alphabet employees have reportedly signed a petition protesting the company's willingness to provide AI technology to a Defense Department drone initiative called Project Maven. About a dozen employees quit, according to Gizmodo and sources familiar.Google Cloud CEO and Alphabet board member Diane Greene reportedly defended Google's decision to participate in Maven.Was Larry Page in favor of Maven as well?Last year, employees staged a walkout over Trump's proposed changes to immigration policy. Pichai and Brin, both immigrants, gave stirring speeches during a massive employee rally over the issue.Page did not.Last year, when the federal government accused Alphabet of systematically underpaying women , Alphabet spokespeople were ready with statements calling the accusations untrue.Page said nothing.Recently, Google made a change to its employee code of conduct: It removed the words ""don't be evil,"" which had been there since 2001.It had already removed those words from its corporate motto in 2016, replacing them with ""do the right thing."" But Gizmodo noticed on Friday the code of conduct had quietly been changed some time in April or May. It's now full of generic corporate language like ""highest ethical standards"" and ""respect.""Pichai makes the decisions for Google, but Page helped create Google and its culture. What does he think of this?Page lets CFO and former Morgan Stanley exec Ruth Porat be the company's liaison to Wall Street. He didn't talk about fact that the company is no longer the second-most valuable tech company after Apple -- it fell behind Amazon in March of this year. It is now hovering around the same level as Microsoft, which hasn't happened since 2012.He had no statement on Eric Schmidt stepping down from the executive chairman spot in December , even though Schmidt was CEO of the company for 10 years as it grew from scrappy start-up to one of the most powerful entities in the world.For that matter, he hasn't said anything about the debate around technology addiction , the role of tech platforms like Google News and YouTube in spreading misinformation , or the role of big tech in media consolidation .The last public appearance Page made was a deposition in a trial where Waymo, formerly the Google self-driving car project, was suing ride-sharing company Uber in an intellectual property dispute. Page gave a deposition last July, but he seemed to have trouble remembering a lot of details, and Uber asked the judge to make him come back to the stand. (The companies settled in February, and Page did not return to the stand.)Larry Page may be able to ignore shareholders -- he, Brin, and Schmidt have unchallenged voting control thanks to the company's multiple share classes and the acquiescence of common shareholders, who seem satisfied with the company's performance.Insiders say that one of the motivations behind the Alphabet reorganization was to give Page good reason to stay out of the limelight, since Pichai now leads the most important company, Google.But as the tech industry becomes the power center of the modern world, hiding from the public is no longer appropriate.

Amazon's Bezos has been mostly quiet about information-gathering, but has publicized his donations to advocacy groups on other social issues like marriage equality and immigration policy.What does the leader of one of the most powerful companies in the world believe?

At the close, Amazon's market cap was about $5 billion greater than Alphabet's. In doing so, Amazon is now the second-most-valuable company in the world behind Apple.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts.While the two companies' market caps are comparable, it's worth remembering that Amazon and the Google parent are still worlds apart in fundamentals.For starters, here are some fundamental metrics for how Amazon and Alphabet fared last year.Metric (TTM)AmazonAlphabetRevenue$177.9 billion$110.9 billionOperating income$4.1 billion$26.1 billionNet income$3 billion$12.7 billionOperating margin2.3%23.6%Net margin1.7%11.4%Free cash flow$8.4 billion$23.9 billionData source: SEC filings. TTM = trailing 12 month.Amazon has long had notoriously thin margins, due to the fact that e-commerce is inherently less profitable combined with Amazon's unrivaled willingness to reinvest in its business. That explains why its margins are so low, as well as why its free cash flow is substantially less than Alphabet's. Amazon's capital expenditures are primarily related to fulfillment infrastructure like warehouses and distribution facilities, while Alphabet's spending includes a lot of network infrastructure like data centers.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Image source: Amazon.The differences in key fundamental metrics point to vastly different valuation ratios, as investors are pricing in much more optimistic expectations into Amazon's future.Valuation MetricAmazonAlphabetP/E (TTM)337.534.3P/S (TTM)4.26.9P/FCF (TTM)54.526P/B (MRQ)275Data source: Reuters. TTM = trailing 12 month. MRQ = most recent quarter.There are also major differences in terms of where each company is looking to expand going forward.Amazon appears to want to disrupt every conceivable industry on Earth, from grocery shopping to healthcare to banking. There are even rumors that the company is preparing to become a major hospital supplier. Whether or not Amazon will be profitable in those endeavors is a different question altogether, and investors may have to wait years for those moves to pay off, if they do at all. But that's par for the course when it comes to Amazon.Meanwhile, Google is expected to start seeing its share of the U.S. ad market slip in the years ahead, although the company is also pushing deeper into hardware in order to better compete with Apple by using the same strategy of integrating hardware and software. That includes its lineup of smart speakers, which looks like an increasingly important battleground.

The NYSE trading suspension highlights the complexity of the fragmented market, but also its resiliency, given that stocks can trade elsewhere when one exchange has a problem.The NYSE is one of last U.S. exchanges to have a physical trading floor, and prior to April 9, only securities that were listed on the exchange could be traded there. But following a recent technology upgrade, the NYSE said it would begin trading securities listed on other exchanges as well.The trading suspension was not likely related to the technology upgrade, Kaus said.In March, the NYSE and two of its affiliate exchanges were fined $14 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, partly in response to a nearly four-hour trading halt in July 2015 that was the result of a flawed software roll out.(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak and John McCrank; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated Quotes"`2018-04-25T18:10:13.000Z`GOOG`

Assuming the transaction dilutes the holdings of current shareholders, the founders each own stakes of 3.6 percent, or $1.36 billion apiece, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bowen, 43, and Monsees, 38, each controlled 5.6 percent of Juul after a July funding round that valued each of their holdings at $843 million.The deal makes San Francisco-based Juul more valuable than Airbnb Inc. and Elon Musk’s SpaceX.“This is a disruptive technology and it shows where consumers want to go,” said Ken Shea, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “It’s growing so fast that the cigarette companies like Altria need to look at a way to mitigate not only cigarette use but also think for the future.”Bowen and Monsees came up with their big idea while pursuing master’s degrees at Stanford University and founded Ploom in 2007. They sold the name to Japan Tobacco Inc. eight years later and renamed their company Pax Labs Inc. Around the same time, the pair introduced a USB-shaped e-cigarette and called it the Juul. Last year, Juul was spun out from Pax and has gone on to dominate the market.--With assistance from Tom Maloney, Olivia Zaleski and Michael Hytha.To contact the reporter on this story: Sophie Alexander in New York at salexander82@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Peter Eichenbaum, Steven CrabillFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2018 Bloomberg L.P.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

So far, Altria has been able to do a good job of boosting prices on its loyal customer base in order to offset the negative impact of sliding overall volume. But recently, the shift in interest away from regular cigarettes toward alternatives like e-cigarettes, vaping, and heated-tobacco units has forced Altria to consider more seriously the need to keep up with the pack in pursuit of reduced-risk products.With longtime chief executive Marty Barrington having recently stepped down, now was a good time for new CEO Howard Willard to redefine the tobacco giant's philosophy and strategic thinking toward reduced-risk products. Altria announced a sweeping restructuring that it hopes will be able to bring the company closer to realizing the full potential of innovative tobacco products, and although investors haven't really reacted immediately to the news, the impact of the strategic shift could make or break Altria's future in the long run.Image source: Altria Group.During the new CEO's time as chief operating officer prior to his promotion, Willard had the responsibility of overseeing all of Altria's operating companies. That included not only the divisions that generated the lion's share of revenue and profits that kept Altria's current success intact but also the newer business lines that have the greatest potential for future growth. With a single person having to divide attention between those two very different strategies, the pace of innovation wasn't always as fast as Altria and its investors had hoped.Willard's proposal will take the tobacco side of Altria's business and break it into two parts. The core tobacco division will consist of the Philip Morris USA cigarette business, the U.S. Smokeless Tobacco unit, Middleton cigars, and Nat Sherman premium tobacco products. Going forward, these units will report to tobacco products Senior Vice President Jody Begley, who in turn will have CFO Billy Gifford overseeing him.Meanwhile, all of the reduced-risk products in Altria's current and prospective pipeline will fall under the jurisdiction of Nu Mark, which has been Altria's primary electronic cigarette brand. New Nu Mark CEO Brian Quigley will lead the innovative products business, reporting directly to Willard. The company will oversee not only the e-vapor and innovative inhalable products business but also oral nicotine-containing products, which will potentially include some forms of smokeless tobacco.One interesting thing about the two divisions is who Willard has chosen to lead them. Quigley's experience has largely been in the smokeless tobacco and cigarette divisions, with the executive having led U.S. Smokeless since 2012. Conversely, Begley has been president and general manager of Nu Mark since 2015. Cross-pollinating these positions is an interesting way to ensure that the entire company shares insights across divisions.In addition to those moves, Altria will also have a Chief Growth Officer position. This role will seek out the best growth opportunities in both traditional and alternative products, identifying consumer trends that it can then translate into product development ideas, as well as the subsequent marketing and consumer engagement once those products are available for the general public.In particular, Altria wants to make sure it has the talent and resources it needs to remain atop the tobacco industry and push forward with innovative product development. That will work toward achieving what it calls its ""aspiration of being the U.S. leader in authorized, non-combustible, reduced-risk products.""Obviously, just having a corporate restructuring won't solve the problem of actually coming up with good products that people want to buy. But Altria's strategy does send a message throughout the company and to the broader tobacco industry that the Marlboro maker is serious about building out its capacity beyond traditional cigarettes and its other legacy products.Going forward, Altria will need to squeeze as much value from its strategic move as it can. Only with success will the tobacco giant be able to evolve with the rest of the industry effectively.

In place of traditional cigarettes, consumers have increasingly moved toward alternatives like e-cigarettes and vaping products, and even the largest players in the tobacco space have made efforts to fill in their product lines with newer offerings designed to capitalize on that demand.To allow for consideration of such strategic moves from the tobacco industry, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began accepting applications to have modified risk tobacco products approved by the regulatory agency. Companies in the industry have responded by submitting applications for items like e-cigarettes and heated-tobacco products, hoping that their claims of more favorable health impacts will earn them approval. Yet late last month, Altria submitted an FDA application for a product that's been around for a long time: smokeless tobacco.Image source: Altria.On March 20, Altria said that its U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company subsidiary had submitted a modified risk tobacco product application for its Copenhagen Snuff Fine Cut moist smokeless tobacco product. The product is U.S. Smokeless Tobacco's most popular line, with nearly a third of the nation's market share of smokeless tobacco.The argument in favor of the application is simple: Altria maintains that experience with smokeless tobacco has demonstrated that the product is less risky than combustible cigarettes. As U.S. Smokeless Tobacco unit CEO Brian Quigley described in Altria's analyst day in November, analysis of studies using government data support the company's claim that smokeless tobacco use is 96% less risky from a mortality standpoint than cigarette smoking, and specific risks for respiratory disease, heart disease, lung cancer, and digestive cancers are significantly lower as well.What many will find surprising is that Altria's scientific evidence shows that even for oral cancer, risks are lower for smokeless tobacco than for traditional cigarette smoking. That runs contrary to popular opinion, especially in light of high-profile sufferers of the disease calling out the product in the past. Yet with its argument that the numbers support the claims, Altria believes that it can successfully argue that Copenhagen deserves modified risk approval.Smokeless tobacco is only a tiny part of Altria's overall business, and part of the problem is that many consumers aren't comfortable with the experience of using the product. Even Quigley admits that moist smokeless tobacco ""only appeals to a subset of adult smokers, and for some, there is social friction."" Copenhagen therefore will represent only a portion of Altria's overall reduced-risk strategy, with other products like the MarkTen e-cigarette also carrying their weight.Even in oral tobacco products, Altria sees potential for products that get a more favorable reception from many consumers who don't like snuff. The Verve line of discs, chews, chewables, and melts offer blue and green mint flavors, and early results in lead markets in Virginia have been encouraging. U.S. Smokeless Tobacco expects to file an FDA application for Verve as well this year, and over the long run, a larger portfolio of products taken orally could make it clear how Altria expects to make a transition from traditional cigarettes.The challenge that Altria faces is that the regulatory environment for tobacco products generally isn't all that good right now. The FDA has been vocal about its efforts to rein in nicotine-containing products more broadly, with recent efforts to require the production of low-nicotine alternatives to traditional tobacco products. It could be difficult for the FDA to approve an existing product without a demonstration of reduced nicotine exposure, and that doesn't seem to be the approach that Altria is making.Moreover, even Altria's own explanations admit that smokeless tobacco isn't a perfect answer. As CEO Marty Barrington said, ""It is now accepted by most public health researchers that smokeless tobacco, while not safe, is a far less-risky way to use nicotine than cigarette smoking."" It's unclear whether the FDA will respond well to claims of relative safety, even though the entire idea of ""modified risk"" assumes that some risk could remain.Altria's move to have Copenhagen approved as a reduced-risk product will surprise some investors, but it's part of the tobacco giant's long-term strategy to address falling demand for regular cigarettes. As the application plays out at the FDA, it'll be interesting to see how Altria fares with this and other products that it expects to submit for regulatory consideration.

The wall of his office had ""Amazon.com"" spray painted on it.And that's about it.Image source: AmazonSomehow, it has morphed into one of the largest and most important organizations the world has ever known. How did we get from point A to point B? While it's an oversimplification on many levels, these seven charts largely tell the story.Back when Bezos was first profiled by 60 Minutes, he had about 2,100 employees. Of course, that's not nothing, but it pales in comparison to where the company is today.Data source: Company annual reports, taken every two years starting in 1998.The current massive employee base is a big deal for two reasons: first, it gives the company clout whenever it's looking to expand operations -- ""Look at how many jobs we create!"" Nothing illustrates that better than the recent phenomenon of hundreds of North American municipalities falling all over themselves in their quest to attract Amazon's HQ2.The second reason this is a big deal is simply that the chart indicates not only that Amazon is growing, but that its growth is accelerating.There should be nothing more important to long-term investors than the sustainable competitive advantages that a company has. While Amazon has a host of moats protecting its business, the one that must be viewed as primary among them is its network of fulfillment centers (FCs).And those centers have been growing in number -- fast.Data source: MWPVL.com, 2020 figures represent planned facilities.These FCs are why Amazon can deliver packages to your front door in two days -- often times even faster. For any other company to match this scale, it would have to undertake a massive effort to invest capital and accept that they'd be losing billions along the way.This fast delivery is the best reason for becoming an Amazon Prime member -- two-day shipping is included free with an annual $99 fee. And the program has proven enormously popular since it was launched in 2005.Data source: StatistaOfficially, the company doesn't publish Prime membership numbers, but these are the estimates that outside experts have given.But the benefits for Amazon don't stop there: the average Prime member spends almost twice as much annually on the site as a nonmember.All of these forces -- Amazon's growing the network of fulfillment centers, its guaranteed fast delivery, its loyalty program -- have combined to produce massive sales growth over the past decade.Data source: SEC filingsFor a company the size of Amazon -- valued at over $700 billion -- last year's sales growth of 31% is very impressive. Even more so: management is forecasting that sales in the current quarter will jump even faster -- by between 34% and 42%.You might have noticed those little orange slices at the top of sales chart above. Those represent Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- the company's cloud hosting tool. Operating profit from the segment has been booming.Data source: SEC filingsHere's what's fascinating about AWS -- which has never accounted for more than 10% of sales. Over the past five years, Amazon -- the entire company -- has generated $11.4 billion in operating income. AWS has provided 90% of that.The company started AWS as a way to reduce IT bottlenecks within the company. Once its solution had been perfected, it simply offered it up to outsiders. Don't be surprised to see Amazon do the same thing with fulfillment (it's already started), delivery (just around the corner), and even healthcare (it's teaming up with a few other extremely big names).All of these forces have combined to create one of the greatest wealth-producing opportunities the world has ever seen.AMZN data by YChartsOur own Chief Rule Breaker David Gardner purchased shares for a split-adjusted $3.19 per share. Of course, not selling is important if want returns like this. And many people probably think the days of heady growth fro Amazon are over.But it would be a mistake to anchor on the past prices of Amazon's stock and think that you've completely missed the boat. As it is, e-commerce only accounts for a small slice of retail sales in America.Image source: U.S. Census BureauAs of the end of the third quarter, less than 10% of all retail sales were completed via e-commerce. The momentum of the shift toward it is undeniable, but many investors underestimate the potential for Amazon to continue exploiting it.You can count me as someone who still believes the company has lots of room to grow. My skin is thoroughly in the game -- Amazon stock accounts for roughly 20% of my real-life holdings. If you have a decades-long time horizon and a stomach for volatility, I suggest you consider taking a small portion of the company as well.

AMZN stock closed yesterday up almost 4% in anticipation of first quarter 2018 results.Amazon more than doubled its quarterly net profit to $1.6 billion as revenue jumped by almost 43%. The revenue growth was AMZN’s best since Q3 2011. Amazon.com said the better-than-expected results were fueled by its Amazon Web Services cloud-services unit and a surge in the company’s advertising business.“AWS had the unusual advantage of a seven-year head start before facing like-minded competition, and the team has never slowed down,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and CEO. “As a result, the AWS services are by far the most evolved and most functionality-rich.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, you definitely don’t want to see the company buy Wayfair Inc (NYSE:W). The same is true if you’re a Wayfair employee. But if you own Wayfair stock, you’d love to see it happen. Here’s why.The Boston Globe painted an idyllic picture of the online home goods retailer May 2 after Wayfair announced an $80-million non-GAAP loss in the first quarter, almost double the loss in the same quarter a year earlier.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips“As with Amazon, Wayfair’s employment growth seems boundless. The company added 1,000 positions in the past quarter alone, driving the total workforce up 13 percent to 8,750 as of March 31,” wrote the Globe’s Jon Crespo. 4 Penny Stocks to Own for 2018 “That means the company is onboarding an average of 15-plus employees per workday. And Boston brokers expect a big Wayfair lease to be signed soon, as the company expands its Back Bay base.”Who wouldn’t want to buy a company with this kind of growth — a 48% year-over-year revenue increase in Q1 2018 to $1.4 billion with a 33% increase in active customers to 11.8 million? Wayfair is seemingly the perfect acquisition for Seattle’s e-commerce powerhouse.Heck, Boston’s even in the running for Amazon’s HQ2; the synergies would be massive. Right? Wrong.Amazon doesn’t have a problem generating revenue. It doesn’t need to buy sales; it needs to buy products and services its customers don’t have. Most of the stuff Wayfair is selling isn’t necessarily unique to Wayfair.In the first quarter, Amazon’s North American sales were $30.7 billion, 46% higher than a year earlier. Meanwhile, its North American operating profits were $1.1 billion, 93% higher than a year earlier.Why would it want to buy Wayfair for between $7-$10 billion to add a money-losing operation with $5 billion in revenue? At least Whole Foods was making money.To think some analysts believe this notion makes sense illustrates why investors shouldn’t listen to analysts.It’s a dumb idea.Do you remember the feel-good story in February about Amazon buying Ring for $1 billion after being rejected by Shark Tank in 2013?From what I’ve heard, many of the employees that work at Ring either have been pushed out the door or could be in the future, to make way for Amazon employees who can get the job done saving the company money.It often happens in buyouts, and while I’m sure the Wayfair employees are all friendly people, Amazon is laying off its employees at a time when the company is booming.Don’t think for a second that Jeff Bezos wouldn’t gut the company if he thought his existing e-commerce operations (think Zappos.com, etc.) could handle the heavy lifting.But, you can breathe easy because I don’t see Wayfair being the type of company Bezos wants to blow billions on. I just don’t.You have to hope that Amazon makes an offer, preferably at an outrageous price, before negative Wayfair stock news sends Wayfair’s share price tumbling into the $30s.Don’t think it can happen?InvestorPlace’s Luke Lango said this about Wayfair stock in early April. I’m 100% in agreement with his viewpoint.“The big driver of revenue growth going forward will have to be customer growth. But that has come down meaningfully, too (67% in fiscal 2015, 54% in fiscal 2016, and 33% in fiscal 2017). Plus, competition from Amazon and others is only heating up,” wrote Lango Apr. 9. “Thus, the most likely outcome over the next several years is a continuation of that decelerating revenue growth trend.”He then goes on to suggest there’s a good possibility that Wayfair stock could drop by 50% over the next four years.Amen, to that.Personally, I don’t see the company ever making money. It has terrible margins despite the fact its business model avoids holding inventory. Wayfair Inc Stock Is Destined to Be a Loser. Get Out While You Can Unless I’m missing something, as my colleague hinted, I too see this ending badly for Wayfair shareholders — but not if Amazon comes to the rescue. 3 Red Hot Chip Stocks That Could Stay Hot For A Lot Longer  Wayfair Inc Stock Is Still a Sell After Thursday's Plunge  7 Stocks to Buy That Lost 10% in April As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The Whole Foods acquisition was clearly the biggest move thus far, but the e-commerce behemoth is now reportedly considering getting into the movie theater business. That age-old business does seem ripe for disruption in some ways, and companies like Helios and Matheson Analytics' (NASDAQ: HMNY) majority-owned MoviePass are trying their darnedest to shake things up. But MoviePass is failing spectacularly, hemorrhaging cash and losing approximately $35 on each of its 3 million members in the second quarter.What might Amazon have in mind?Image source: Getty Images.Bloomberg reports that Amazon is among several suitors that are considering acquiring Landmark Theatres, a movie theater chain that specializes in showing foreign and independent films. Landmark is owned in part by billionaire Mark Cuban. With a little more than 50 locations, Landmark is much smaller than AMC (NYSE: AMC), Regal (which was recently acquired by Cineworld), and Cinemark (NYSE: CNK), the three largest domestic movie chains. MoviePass also added Landmark to its service earlier this year.The ""Amazon Effect"" took hold in early trading, with shares of AMC and Cinemark falling on the report before quickly recovering.The potential acquisition would give Amazon broader distribution for its growing portfolio of original content, which currently is primarily streamed through Amazon Prime Video. Like rival Netflix -- which is also rumored to be interested in Landmark -- Amazon Studios has been pushing deeper and deeper into original content in an effort to differentiate Amazon's over-the-top (OTT) streaming service.The report also notes that movie studios are currently prohibited from owning theaters, but regulators are considering eliminating that rule, which dates back to the 1940s. Any acquisition could hinge on that regulatory outcome.If you look at why MoviePass continues to flounder, the basic economics are simple -- and horrendous. MoviePass buys the tickets for full price from theater chains, and only recoups $10 per month in subscription fees (before factoring in the ever-changing fine print like surge pricing). AMC CEO Adam Aron said in May that MoviePass paid AMC an average of $12.02 per ticket in the second quarter, with MoviePass members seeing an average of 2.75 movies in April.MoviePass has already garnered many enemies in the theater industry, risking commoditization while diminishing the value perception of the movie-going experience.The start-up has tried to partner with chains to get a cut of ticket sales in an effort to reduce its costs, as well as trying to get a piece of concession sales. That's worked with some smaller chains, but the big chains have unequivocally shut down that possibility. ""AMC has absolutely no intention -- I repeat, no intention -- of sharing any -- I repeat, any -- of our admissions revenue or our concessions revenue with MoviePass,"" Aron said on the January earnings call.Image source: Getty Images.With a current market cap of less than $300,000, Helios and Matheson is little more than a thorn in the side of the big chains, but Amazon is a heavyweight you don't want stepping in your arena. Vertical integration can be an incredibly potent strategy, particularly for a company that has long shown a unique willingness to absorb losses and sacrifice profits in order to dominate industries. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos once famously said, ""Your margin is my opportunity.""Here's what AMC's and Cinemark's margins in the second quarter looked like:MetricAMCCinemarkAdmissions revenue$896.3 million$508.9 millionCost of admissions$471.4 million$287.2 millionAdmissions gross margin47%44%Concessions revenue$445.8 million$305.3 millionCost of concessions$72.2 million$51 millionConcessions gross margin84%83%Data source: SEC filings.Even before you consider any cost savings associated with vertical integration, those popcorn margins alone suggest that Amazon has quite a bit of opportunity.We also know from the Whole Foods acquisition that Amazon does want to integrate its physical retail aspirations into its wildly popular Prime subscription, as Prime members enjoy benefits and discounts when they shop at Whole Foods. It's not hard to imagine Amazon offering a comparable set of perks at the movies for Prime members, such as heavily discounted ticket prices and affordable concessions.If Amazon were to acquire Landmark, or any other theater chain, it wouldn't face any of the fundamental tensions that MoviePass currently faces within its value chain, as Amazon would own that part of the value chain. Being a loss leader doesn't work if you're a tiny company that's running out of money, like MoviePass.

But now, it has opened a storefront on Amazon, where its merchandise will be eligible for Amazon's two-day shipping through Prime membership. While that promises to help boost sales in its most profitable segment, it also risks antagonizing its dealer network.You can now shop on Amazon for that Harley look. Image source: Harley-Davidson.General merchandise is Harley's smallest operating segment, representing a little more than 5% of total sales. But it generated $262 million in revenue last year and $125 million so far through 2018, so it's not an inconsequential amount. Perhaps more important, it's the most profitable part of the business, more so than the aftermarket parts and accessories it sells, and more than the premiums earned on even its most profitable bikes.Industry data suggests that dealers generate margins of more than 40% for merchandise like the logo leather jackets, boots, and tchotchkes they sell, compared to 38% on parts and accessories such as the chrome pipes, lights, and other accoutrements riders add to their bikes. The motorcycles themselves carry gross margins of around 15% to 20%.By opening a storefront on Amazon, Harley-Davidson expands the number of customers it can reach beyond those who walk into a dealership. It's part of the broader strategy Harley laid out in its More Roads to Harley-Davidson roadmap this past July.One of the key tenets of the plan was ""broader access,"" which Harley defined as ""meet[ing] customers where they are and how they want to engage with a multichannel retail experience.""Unfortunately, it also undercuts one of the other two legs that Harley wants to stand on: strong dealers (the third leg is new products).Because most of the gear that Harley-Davidson sells is sold through its network of nearly 700 dealers in the U.S., opening an Amazon storefront puts the corporate office in direct competition with its dealers, much more so than the company website ever did. It is exposing tens of millions of customers to Harley apparel and merchandise and cutting the dealerships out of the loop.Apparel has been one of the few growth areas for Harley, up 9% in the second quarter, and over 5% for the first six months of the year. In comparison, motorcycle revenue is essentially flat this year, with shipments down 10.5%, while parts and accessories are off 1.1% year to date.What could be worse for the dealers is that if the Amazon apparel storefront is successful, it's quite possible that Harley will begin selling parts and accessories on the site, too. That category generated $804 million in revenue last year and another $400 million in the first half of 2018. Offering these parts online could cut a good percentage of dealers' sales and profits. And then how far behind might a build-your-own-bike option be?It makes sense for Harley-Davidson to have an Amazon storefront in today's marketplace, but it still needs its dealers, as it sells all of its bikes through them. Although you're not likely to see any dealers dumping their dealerships over the new policy, no vehicle manufacturer can afford to antagonize its dealers. The good news is, Harley-Davidson says it hopes to somehow integrate the online experience with them.Still, many dealers are already grumbling about the direction the company is taking toward turning around falling sales and the ineffectiveness of management at reversing the trend. While this maneuver could introduce more people to the brand who might otherwise have not stepped foot in a dealership beforehand, it will take sales away from dealers before a dealer will see any increase in sales. And that's a strategy that will drive a wedge deeper between the company and its dealers.

This was a strong indication that the carrier was nearing a deal to expand its Dreamliner fleet instead.Sure enough, on Friday, Boeing and American Airlines announced an order for 47 Dreamliners, consisting of 22 787-8s and 25 787-9s. This will more than double the size of American's 787 fleet -- and it continues a recent surge of order activity for Boeing's Dreamliner.American Airlines ordered another 47 Boeing 787 Dreamliners last week. Image source: Boeing.US Airways -- which merged with American Airlines back in 2013 -- ordered 22 Airbus A350s more than a decade ago. However, American Airlines has deferred these A350 deliveries twice in the past two years, casting doubt on whether it really wanted to add this aircraft type to its fleet. More recently, management has indicated that it wants to simplify the fleet to improve the carrier's efficiency.This gave Boeing a big advantage vis-a-vis Airbus, because American Airlines already operates the 787-8 and the 787-9. By contrast, it doesn't have any A330neos or A350s today.Last week's aircraft order adds on to the 20 787-8s and 15 787-9s already in American's fleet, as well as the seven additional 787-9s it has on order for 2018 and 2019. Deliveries of the 22 787-8s are set to begin in 2020. These aircraft will be used to replace American Airlines' 24 767s, which are nearing retirement age.Meanwhile, the 25 787-9s are scheduled to arrive beginning in 2023. They will replace some of American's older 777-200ERs, as well as its nine A330-300s, according to the carrier. This seems to imply that American Airlines has decided to hold on to its A330-300s longer than it had previously planned. As of a few months ago, they were all scheduled to exit the fleet in 2020.All of the aircraft ordered last week will be delivered by 2026. Looking further ahead, American Airlines has options to acquire as many as 28 additional 787s between 2026 and 2028.In conjunction with the expanded Dreamliner purchase, American Airlines is canceling its A350 order for good. As a result, it will record a special charge related to writing off purchase deposits that it will forfeit to Airbus.American Airlines has canceled its order for 22 A350-900s. Image source: Airbus.Nevertheless, switching from the A350-900 to a mix of 787-8s and 787-9s should significantly reduce the company's aircraft acquisition costs. US Airways was a small, struggling carrier when it placed the initial A350 order, so it probably didn't get especially good pricing.By contrast, American Airlines is the largest airline in the world. Furthermore, the 787 order it just placed was substantially larger than the 25-30 airplane deal industry observers had expected. The carrier likely used its purchasing power to get a very good deal from Boeing, which has been chasing Dreamliner sales aggressively this year by offering low prices.Boeing brought in 94 net orders for its 787 aircraft family last year, easily its best result since 2013. However, Boeing needs to average closer to 150 orders annually for its plan to build 14 787s per month to be sustainable for more than a handful of years.While Boeing didn't report any Dreamliner order activity in January or February, it has been on a tear since the beginning of March. It has announced a conditional order for 10 787-9s from Hawaiian Holdings, a firm order for 25 787-9s from Turkish Airlines, and now the firm order for 47 787s from American Airlines.Additionally, Emirates signed a commitment for 40 787-10s last November. There is some risk to that order, with U.S. airlines pushing the Trump administration to crack down on the growth of Emirates and its two largest rivals in the Middle East. However, if Emirates does firm up its 787 commitment this year, it would boost the type's 2018 order total to an impressive 122 aircraft.Boeing has had to offer lower prices to win some of these recent deals. Yet the longer it can sustain 787 output at a rate of 14 per month, the lower its production costs will go. This makes its discounting strategy a smart move that will improve its long-term competitiveness in the widebody market.

According to a Facebook post by her husband, Jay Tang, Hu had been previously assured that their cello would be allowed to fly on an American Airlines plane on both her departing and returning flight.In an interview with NBC5 Chicago, Hu said, ""We always buy a extra ticket for our cello so that we can carry our cello on the plane,"" and said that the cello is worth $30,000.Nothing appeared to be problematic on Hu's first leg of the trip.Hu told Chicago-based radio station WMAQ, ""When I flew from Chicago to Miami, I didn’t have any trouble with that."" She even added that the flight crew on the Miami flight had actually given her a special strap to hold the large instrument. But all that changed when she boarded her flight from Miami back to Chicago. Right before takeoff, an American Airlines flight attendant told Hu that her instrument was too big and that the aircraft, a 737, was too small to hold the cello.According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, Federal regulations allow musicians to carry instruments like cellos in the cabin if passengers purchase an additional seat. American Airlines policy states that if passengers buy another seat for their instrument, then that seat's baggage must not weigh more than 165 lbs and must meet seat size restrictions for that specific plane type. NBC5 Chicago reports that Hu's instrument weighs less than 10 lbs.In a statement to Business Insider, an American Airlines spokesperson said, ""A passenger on flight 2457 from Miami to Chicago was traveling with her cello. Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication about whether the cello she was traveling with met the requirements to fit onboard the particular aircraft she was flying, a Boeing 737. We rebooked our passenger on a flight the next morning on a larger aircraft, a Boeing 767. We provided her a hotel and meal accommodations for the inconvenience. We apologize for the misunderstanding and customer relations has reached out to her.""Hu's husband, Jay Tang, wrote that after being escorted off the plane, Hu was surrounded by three police officers while trying to find a new flight that could accommodate her. He said American Airlines offered her the chance to purchase either first class or business class tickets out of pocket. Eventually, after staying overnight at a Holiday Inn, Hu arrived back home in Chicago, Cello in tow, where she had a tearful greeting with her husband.""I don't think we did anything wrong there,"" Tang, told NBC5 Chicago. ""And I think the way they handled it was humiliating.""Tang posted on Twitter a photo Hu had taken of the flight's captain giving her the peace sign as she was being led off the plane.

This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other large companies. Next, we’ll consider growth that the business demonstrates. Third, we’ll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO.  Check out our latest analysis for American Electric Power Company  According to our data, American Electric Power Company Inc has a market capitalization of US$37b, and pays its CEO total annual compensation worth US$12m. (This figure is for the year to 2017). We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at US$1.4m. When we examined a group of companies with market caps over US$8.0b, we found that their median CEO compensation was US$11m.So Nick Akins is paid around the average of the companies we looked at. Although this fact alone doesn’t tell us a great deal, it becomes more relevant when considered against the business performance.You can see, below, how CEO compensation at American Electric Power Company has changed over time.Over the last three years American Electric Power Company Inc has grown its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 9.3% per year. Its revenue is up 5.2% over last year.I would argue that the improvement in revenue isn’t particularly impressive, but it is good to see modest EPS growth. So there are some positives here, but not enough to earn high praise.Shareholders might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts. .I think that the total shareholder return of 51%, over three years, would leave most American Electric Power Company Inc shareholders smiling. So they may not be at all concerned if the CEO is paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.Nick Akins is paid around the same as most CEOs of large companies.The company isn’t showing particularly great growth, but shareholder returns have been pleasing. So all things considered I’d venture that the CEO pay is appropriate. Shareholders may want to check for free if American Electric Power Company insiders are buying or selling shares.

AEO is gaining momentum on the back of its multiple strategic initiatives, including robust omni-channel endeavors and efforts to strengthen brands. Impressively, the company has been putting up a stellar show, posting 14th straight quarter of positive comparable store sales (comps) in second-quarter fiscal 2018. Additionally, it delivered a sales beat in five of the trailing six quarters and a positive earnings surprise in three of the last five quarters.Let’s Delve DeepAmerican Eagle’s comps have been benefiting from strategic initiatives and ability to boost market share through strong brands and compelling merchandise. Further, both digital and in-store business is aiding comps growth.Additionally, the company is witnessing higher transactions backed by an increase in traffic and conversion besides improvement in transaction value and average unit retail price. Brand-wise, comps rose 27% and 7% at Aerie stores and AE brand outlets, respectively, in second-quarter fiscal 2018. The AE brand is gaining from its leadership position in bottoms, with jeans business recording 20th consecutive quarter of comps growth. Further, the quarter marked Aerie brand’s 15th straight quarter of double-digit comps growth, reflecting a significant momentum in all areas of the business.American Eagle continues to witness spectacular growth for its Aerie brand, which contributed about 16% to sales in the fiscal second quarter. Notably, Aerie has evolved into a lifestyle brand and remains focused on expanding market share and rapidly growing customer base. Further, the company is extending category reach with expansions in the swimwear, active wear apparel and continued growth in the intimate space. The Aerie brand remains on track to reach the next milestone of $1 billion in sales.Additionally, American Eagle’s focus on enhancing its digital presence as well as making investment in store fleet is commendable. The company marked 14th straight quarter of double-digit e-commerce growth and contributed 24% to net sales in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, trends in brick-and-mortar stores continued to improve as both AE and Aerie stores reported positive in-store comps, increasing high-single digits.Some other leading retailers that are significantly gaining from its omni-channel experience including e-commerce are Nordstrom, Inc. JWN, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF. DICK'S Sporting recorded e-commerce growth of 12% year over year, with expansion of e-commerce penetration to about 11% of net sales in second-quarter fiscal 2018. Nordstrom’s digital sales improved 23% in the same period, with digitally-enabled sales contribution of 34%. Further, Abercrombie’s Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) sales surged 16% in second-quarter fiscal 2018 and accounted for nearly 26% of net sales.Coming back to American Eagle, we note that the company also enjoys a strong financial status. The company had a debt-free balance sheet, with cash and cash equivalents of $323.3 million as of Aug 4, where it also generated healthy cash flows. These helped the company to make capital investments alongside returning excess cash to its shareholders via dividends and share buybacks.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

(AXP) showed an improvement in revenue and profitability. Compared to the same quarter of the prior year, total revenue increased by 9% to $10 billion, while diluted earnings per share moved 25% higher to $1.84.The company benefited from 19% growth in net interest income, with higher loan balances being the key driver. Increased spending by cardholders was a major catalyst during the period. It helped to increase discount revenue by 8%, while net card fees moved 9% higher.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with AXP. Click here to check it out. AXP 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of AXPPeter Lynch Chart of AXPThe company reaffirmed its previous guidance for the full year. It expects to deliver earnings that are at the high end of its previous range of $6.90 to $7.30 per share.Product differentiationSince the release of its second-quarter results in July, American Express' stock price has risen 5%. That takes its gain in the last year to 24%, which is significantly higher than the 17% rise delivered by the S&P 500 over the same period.The financial performance of the business could be catalyzed by continued product differentiation. It has been able to appeal to a wide range of consumers through product innovation, with around half of customer acquisitions on its U.S. consumer platinum cards coming from millennials. Services such as rewards for its card members, access to exclusive airport lounges and credits to ride-sharing services are appealing to consumers across the globe. This is helping to boost demand for its fee-paying cards in particular, with 60% of its new card acquisitions being in this space.American Express is also seeking to differentiate its offering in terms of the technology it provides to customers. It is making significant investments in the digital space, seeking to develop artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain capabilities to improve customer service levels. These investments seem to be having a tangible impact. The company placed first in J.D. Power's 2018 mobile app competitive survey. Among millennials in particular, an increased focus on technology could lead to rising customer numbers.Strategic focusWith discount revenue contributing to the majority of the company's revenue in the second quarter, American Express' refreshed strategy in this area could make a significant impact on its overall returns. It is focused on increasing discount revenue through maintaining discount rates. This is helping to widen acceptance of American Express products, so that cardholders can use their cards more often. This should provide the company with a higher share of wallet with existing cardmembers.One example of its discount strategy is the OptBlue program. It allows smaller merchants to negotiate directly with a third party for card fees, which has helped to increase merchant acceptance of the company's products. In the last year, the company has signed over a million merchants in the U.S. This could help to make its products more attractive to new customers.The company also has valuable data on customers due, in part, to its business model. Since it lends directly to its account holders, it operates a closed-loop network. This provides it with data that a number of rivals do not have. Customer data could help shape how American Express adapts its customer offers and may be able to keep it a step ahead of the competition in what is a fast-moving industry.Possible threatsA possible threat facing American Express is an increasing provision for bad debt. In the second quarter, total provisions grew 38% to $806 million versus the previous year. This could prove to be a drag on earnings, with the company expecting a rise in provisions at a similar level in the second half of the year to that recorded in the first half. Alongside this, the company's lending net write-off rate has risen from 1.8% in the year-ago quarter to 2.1% in the second quarter. This could have a negative impact on its future prospects if it continues to rise.The company, though, has guided investors toward a higher level of provisions. Its growth in this area in the first half of the year is in line with guidance. It has been targeting new customers who are more likely to be carrying a balance. The increasing size of its loan book also means that provisions are likely to continue to rise. Similarly, a higher net write-off rate is not yet a cause for concern since it remains low compared to its sector peers.VerdictA focus on product differentiation could lead to improved financial performance for American Express. An increasing focus on technology, utilizing data and widening acceptance of its cards could also act as positive catalysts over the medium term. Although provisions and write-offs have risen, an increase in the size of its loan book and favorable comparisons to sector peers mean the company appears to be performing well. Its stock price could, therefore, increase further after outperforming the S&P 500 over the last year.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.Warning!

But it has recently struggled to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape in the business of financial transactions. As a result, both its revenue and profit peaked in 2014. What lies ahead for American Express, and is it undervalued at its current stock price of $99?American Express is a unique financial company which has been led by its well-known CEO Kenneth Chenault for the last sixteen years. While the company is mostly known for its credit cards and traveler cheques, it differs in one important point from other credit card companies like Visa or MasterCard. While these two competitors mostly make money by collecting fees for providing the financial architecture used for financial transactions, American Express additionally also owns the loans. Therefore, it also features many elements of a traditional bank – and indeed American Express is officially registered as a bank since 2008.To determine the value of American Express, let’s start by looking at the company’s history of free cash flow. The free cash flow is important because it represents the company’s ability to retain earnings and grow the business. Most importantly, it demonstrates a return on the principal that might be invested into the ownership of equity of the business. Below is a chart of American Express’ free cash flow over the past ten years.As one can see, the results oscillate around a slowly rising long-term mean value. To model the expected future cash flow, we will use a conservative estimate.Each line in the above graph represents a certain probability for occurring. We assume a 20% chance for the upper growth rate of 3% per year, a 50% chance for an annual growth of 0%, and a 30% chance for the worst-case scenario of -5% annual growth. Assuming these growth rates and probabilities are accurate, American Express can be expected to give a 6.2% annual return at the current price of $99. Now, let’s discuss how and why those free cash flows could be achieved.American Express possesses several advantages:Branding. American Express is a very strong and trusted brand. For many clients, it is even a status symbol to use an “Amex card.” This premium branding is actively reinforced by the company – by offering special gold or platinum cards to important clients and by providing unique deals and bonus offers.Management. Kenneth Chenault has been an outstanding CEO, and even after his recent departure, the strong corporate culture can be expected to continue. Closed-loop business model. In contrast to Visa or MasterCard (which both only provide the architecture for transactions – an “open loop” model), American Express also owns the loans, making it a “closed-loop” model. It, therefore, has two sources of revenue and also has more control and information over the complete process and its clients.The risks for American Express are impossible to overlook in the new era for banks and credit card companies. Here is a list of the most important headwinds:Increasing “traditional” competition. The credit business gets more and more crowded and competitive resulting in lower margins. Besides the long-time competition by Visa and MasterCard (which are both several times larger than American Express), traditional banks like JPMorgan or Bank of America are now also major players in the credit card business.New competition. Several new players have entered the business field that American Express is operating in. These include PayPal, Alibaba’s Alipay, Tencent’s Tenpay, Apple Pay, as well as multiple smaller Fintech startups. All of these companies change and shape the way that we buy things and use credit – and nobody can yet predict, how the future will eventually look like.Creative destruction. All industries can be disrupted by innovation – popularly called “creative destruction.” A company like American Express is affected as well. The blockchain is expected to change the landscape of traditional banking, and new cryptocurrencies can send and process payments a lot fatter and more importantly cheaper than traditional companies. Loss of Costco exclusivity arrangement. From 2004-2016, American Express had a special deal with Costco, a retailer. During this time, Costco had accepted credit cards solely from American Express. When this exclusive deal ended in favor of Capital One and MasterCard, American Express’s revenue decreased by about 5%. Strong focus on the U.S. While American Express cards are routinely accepted in the U.S., in the rest of the world, its cards can often not be used for payment. This makes the company vulnerable to a worsening U.S. economy and limits its growth possibilities.When looking at various investing opportunities on the market today, let’s compare the expected return of American Express to other ideas. First, one could invest in the ten-year treasury bond which is producing a 2.5% return. Considering the bond is completely impacted by inflation, the real return of this option is likely below 1%. Currently, the S&P 500 Shiller P/E ratio is 32. As a result, the U.S. Stock Market is priced at a 3.1% yield. If one were to invest in the S&P500, they might purchase a low-cost ETF to take advantage of this return.The banking and credit card sector is currently experiencing a major disruption– both because of old and new market players. While in the short term, the business model of American Express should continue to work. In the medium and longer term, it is very hard to predict. At this moment, nobody knows how the finance and credit system will work in the future.American Express is a unique company, but its future is quite hard to predict since the financial landscape is undergoing a major change. The jury is still out whether this model will also work in the future. American Express is a strong company with the traditional advantages of a well-establish financial company. However, despite the temporary jump in the trailing twelve-month free cash flow that was not included in the first graph, the risks are piling up and a much more conservative approach with the basis of the end of the financial year of 2016 should instead be used. Given the assumptions outlined in this article, an expected annual return of 6.2% seems like a relatively fair value.*This article was written in collaboration with Christoph Wolf from Christoph Wolf Value InvestingStig Brodersen is the host of the business podcast “We Study Billionaires.” You can find his free intrinsic value index here of popular stock picks.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

But it has recently struggled to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape in the business of financial transactions. As a result, both its revenue and profit peaked in 2014. What lies ahead for American Express, and is it undervalued at its current stock price of $99?American Express is a unique financial company which has been led by its well-known CEO Kenneth Chenault for the last sixteen years. While the company is mostly known for its credit cards and traveler cheques, it differs in one important point from other credit card companies like Visa or MasterCard. While these two competitors mostly make money by collecting fees for providing the financial architecture used for financial transactions, American Express additionally also owns the loans. Therefore, it also features many elements of a traditional bank – and indeed American Express is officially registered as a bank since 2008.To determine the value of American Express, let’s start by looking at the company’s history of free cash flow. The free cash flow is important because it represents the company’s ability to retain earnings and grow the business. Most importantly, it demonstrates a return on the principal that might be invested into the ownership of equity of the business. Below is a chart of American Express’ free cash flow over the past ten years.As one can see, the results oscillate around a slowly rising long-term mean value. To model the expected future cash flow, we will use a conservative estimate.Each line in the above graph represents a certain probability for occurring. We assume a 20% chance for the upper growth rate of 3% per year, a 50% chance for an annual growth of 0%, and a 30% chance for the worst-case scenario of -5% annual growth. Assuming these growth rates and probabilities are accurate, American Express can be expected to give a 6.2% annual return at the current price of $99. Now, let’s discuss how and why those free cash flows could be achieved.American Express possesses several advantages:Branding. American Express is a very strong and trusted brand. For many clients, it is even a status symbol to use an “Amex card.” This premium branding is actively reinforced by the company – by offering special gold or platinum cards to important clients and by providing unique deals and bonus offers.Management. Kenneth Chenault has been an outstanding CEO, and even after his recent departure, the strong corporate culture can be expected to continue. Closed-loop business model. In contrast to Visa or MasterCard (which both only provide the architecture for transactions – an “open loop” model), American Express also owns the loans, making it a “closed-loop” model. It, therefore, has two sources of revenue and also has more control and information over the complete process and its clients.The risks for American Express are impossible to overlook in the new era for banks and credit card companies. Here is a list of the most important headwinds:Increasing “traditional” competition. The credit business gets more and more crowded and competitive resulting in lower margins. Besides the long-time competition by Visa and MasterCard (which are both several times larger than American Express), traditional banks like JPMorgan or Bank of America are now also major players in the credit card business.New competition. Several new players have entered the business field that American Express is operating in. These include PayPal, Alibaba’s Alipay, Tencent’s Tenpay, Apple Pay, as well as multiple smaller Fintech startups. All of these companies change and shape the way that we buy things and use credit – and nobody can yet predict, how the future will eventually look like.Creative destruction. All industries can be disrupted by innovation – popularly called “creative destruction.” A company like American Express is affected as well. The blockchain is expected to change the landscape of traditional banking, and new cryptocurrencies can send and process payments a lot fatter and more importantly cheaper than traditional companies. Loss of Costco exclusivity arrangement. From 2004-2016, American Express had a special deal with Costco, a retailer. During this time, Costco had accepted credit cards solely from American Express. When this exclusive deal ended in favor of Capital One and MasterCard, American Express’s revenue decreased by about 5%. Strong focus on the U.S. While American Express cards are routinely accepted in the U.S., in the rest of the world, its cards can often not be used for payment. This makes the company vulnerable to a worsening U.S. economy and limits its growth possibilities.When looking at various investing opportunities on the market today, let’s compare the expected return of American Express to other ideas. First, one could invest in the ten-year treasury bond which is producing a 2.5% return. Considering the bond is completely impacted by inflation, the real return of this option is likely below 1%. Currently, the S&P 500 Shiller P/E ratio is 32. As a result, the U.S. Stock Market is priced at a 3.1% yield. If one were to invest in the S&P500, they might purchase a low-cost ETF to take advantage of this return.The banking and credit card sector is currently experiencing a major disruption– both because of old and new market players. While in the short term, the business model of American Express should continue to work. In the medium and longer term, it is very hard to predict. At this moment, nobody knows how the finance and credit system will work in the future.American Express is a unique company, but its future is quite hard to predict since the financial landscape is undergoing a major change. The jury is still out whether this model will also work in the future. American Express is a strong company with the traditional advantages of a well-establish financial company. However, despite the temporary jump in the trailing twelve-month free cash flow that was not included in the first graph, the risks are piling up and a much more conservative approach with the basis of the end of the financial year of 2016 should instead be used. Given the assumptions outlined in this article, an expected annual return of 6.2% seems like a relatively fair value.*This article was written in collaboration with Christoph Wolf from Christoph Wolf Value InvestingStig Brodersen is the host of the business podcast “We Study Billionaires.” You can find his free intrinsic value index here of popular stock picks.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

(AXP) showed an improvement in revenue and profitability. Compared to the same quarter of the prior year, total revenue increased by 9% to $10 billion, while diluted earnings per share moved 25% higher to $1.84.The company benefited from 19% growth in net interest income, with higher loan balances being the key driver. Increased spending by cardholders was a major catalyst during the period. It helped to increase discount revenue by 8%, while net card fees moved 9% higher.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with AXP. Click here to check it out. AXP 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of AXPPeter Lynch Chart of AXPThe company reaffirmed its previous guidance for the full year. It expects to deliver earnings that are at the high end of its previous range of $6.90 to $7.30 per share.Product differentiationSince the release of its second-quarter results in July, American Express' stock price has risen 5%. That takes its gain in the last year to 24%, which is significantly higher than the 17% rise delivered by the S&P 500 over the same period.The financial performance of the business could be catalyzed by continued product differentiation. It has been able to appeal to a wide range of consumers through product innovation, with around half of customer acquisitions on its U.S. consumer platinum cards coming from millennials. Services such as rewards for its card members, access to exclusive airport lounges and credits to ride-sharing services are appealing to consumers across the globe. This is helping to boost demand for its fee-paying cards in particular, with 60% of its new card acquisitions being in this space.American Express is also seeking to differentiate its offering in terms of the technology it provides to customers. It is making significant investments in the digital space, seeking to develop artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain capabilities to improve customer service levels. These investments seem to be having a tangible impact. The company placed first in J.D. Power's 2018 mobile app competitive survey. Among millennials in particular, an increased focus on technology could lead to rising customer numbers.Strategic focusWith discount revenue contributing to the majority of the company's revenue in the second quarter, American Express' refreshed strategy in this area could make a significant impact on its overall returns. It is focused on increasing discount revenue through maintaining discount rates. This is helping to widen acceptance of American Express products, so that cardholders can use their cards more often. This should provide the company with a higher share of wallet with existing cardmembers.One example of its discount strategy is the OptBlue program. It allows smaller merchants to negotiate directly with a third party for card fees, which has helped to increase merchant acceptance of the company's products. In the last year, the company has signed over a million merchants in the U.S. This could help to make its products more attractive to new customers.The company also has valuable data on customers due, in part, to its business model. Since it lends directly to its account holders, it operates a closed-loop network. This provides it with data that a number of rivals do not have. Customer data could help shape how American Express adapts its customer offers and may be able to keep it a step ahead of the competition in what is a fast-moving industry.Possible threatsA possible threat facing American Express is an increasing provision for bad debt. In the second quarter, total provisions grew 38% to $806 million versus the previous year. This could prove to be a drag on earnings, with the company expecting a rise in provisions at a similar level in the second half of the year to that recorded in the first half. Alongside this, the company's lending net write-off rate has risen from 1.8% in the year-ago quarter to 2.1% in the second quarter. This could have a negative impact on its future prospects if it continues to rise.The company, though, has guided investors toward a higher level of provisions. Its growth in this area in the first half of the year is in line with guidance. It has been targeting new customers who are more likely to be carrying a balance. The increasing size of its loan book also means that provisions are likely to continue to rise. Similarly, a higher net write-off rate is not yet a cause for concern since it remains low compared to its sector peers.VerdictA focus on product differentiation could lead to improved financial performance for American Express. An increasing focus on technology, utilizing data and widening acceptance of its cards could also act as positive catalysts over the medium term. Although provisions and write-offs have risen, an increase in the size of its loan book and favorable comparisons to sector peers mean the company appears to be performing well. Its stock price could, therefore, increase further after outperforming the S&P 500 over the last year.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.Warning!

Members can earn 5X Membership Rewards points for select products and brands.American Express will initially provide rewards points to Boxed customers for Cheerios cereal, Planters nuts, Dove soap and a few other items, according to the Associated Press. American Express plans to make the program available to nearly all merchant partners in the coming months.The technology has helped to target individual items, which in the past has proven challenging since merchants’ inventory systems differ from one another. Hyperledger blockchain technology enabled American Express to solve the problem so that merchants and American Express can create product-targeted offers.Chris Cracchiolo, who oversees Membership Rewards at American Express, said merchants can develop programs based on time of day and day of week by encouraging the customer to download the merchant’s app. Merchants will have significantly more ways to reward customers.While customers could be targeted for an offer based on spending behavior at a particular merchant under the Amex Offers program in the past, these offers could not target specific products.Because American Express owns and manages the blockchain technology, merchants incur minimal setup time to participate in the program. American Express can get merchants’ offers up and running in weeks rather than months.Also read: American Express wants “full advantage of blockchain,” joins open-source Hyperledger projectA private channel on the company’s blockchain will allow merchants to send and receive information securely. The merchant will have control over the offers they wish to market, and they will be able to create custom Membership Rewards offers and designate SKU level bonuses.American Express will have full visibility of the offers on the blockchain and will ensure the promotions conform to its brand values and merchant agreements.Once the offers are available to customers, the smart contract will automatically send the anonymized transaction to American Express on the private blockchain. American Express will identify the card member and issue them their rewards points.American Express will work with merchants to create the smart contracts for the offers.The credit card giant is a premiere Hyperledger member, along with Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, IBM, Intel, Baidu and Accenture.Marc Gordon, American Express information chief and vice president, said the company wants to take full advantage of blockchain to deliver innovative products for customers and partners when it joined Hyperledger.Featured Image from American ExpressThe post American Express Taps Hyperledger Blockchain for Rewards Program Revamp appeared first on CCN.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Members can earn 5X Membership Rewards points for select products and brands.American Express will initially provide rewards points to Boxed customers for Cheerios cereal, Planters nuts, Dove soap and a few other items, according to the Associated Press. American Express plans to make the program available to nearly all merchant partners in the coming months.The technology has helped to target individual items, which in the past has proven challenging since merchants’ inventory systems differ from one another. Hyperledger blockchain technology enabled American Express to solve the problem so that merchants and American Express can create product-targeted offers.Chris Cracchiolo, who oversees Membership Rewards at American Express, said merchants can develop programs based on time of day and day of week by encouraging the customer to download the merchant’s app. Merchants will have significantly more ways to reward customers.While customers could be targeted for an offer based on spending behavior at a particular merchant under the Amex Offers program in the past, these offers could not target specific products.Because American Express owns and manages the blockchain technology, merchants incur minimal setup time to participate in the program. American Express can get merchants’ offers up and running in weeks rather than months.Also read: American Express wants “full advantage of blockchain,” joins open-source Hyperledger projectA private channel on the company’s blockchain will allow merchants to send and receive information securely. The merchant will have control over the offers they wish to market, and they will be able to create custom Membership Rewards offers and designate SKU level bonuses.American Express will have full visibility of the offers on the blockchain and will ensure the promotions conform to its brand values and merchant agreements.Once the offers are available to customers, the smart contract will automatically send the anonymized transaction to American Express on the private blockchain. American Express will identify the card member and issue them their rewards points.American Express will work with merchants to create the smart contracts for the offers.The credit card giant is a premiere Hyperledger member, along with Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, IBM, Intel, Baidu and Accenture.Marc Gordon, American Express information chief and vice president, said the company wants to take full advantage of blockchain to deliver innovative products for customers and partners when it joined Hyperledger.Featured Image from American ExpressThe post American Express Taps Hyperledger Blockchain for Rewards Program Revamp appeared first on CCN.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

What about increasing a bet on British American Tobacco PLC (BTI)?For the 52 weeks through Sept. 10, its share price has declined 26% to $47.40, trading 17.5% below the 200-day simple moving average line and approximately 10% below the 100- and 50-SMA lines.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with BTI. Click here to check it out. BTI 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BTIPeter Lynch Chart of BTIThe current share price is almost on par with the 52-week low of $47.34 and more than 50% from the 52-week high of $71.44.British American Tobacco has a market capitalization of $108.23 billion on the New York Stock Exchange. Following the drop in the value of the stock, the price-book ratio is 1.34 versus an industry median of 3.7,8 and the price-earnings ratio is 2.02 versus an industry median of 17.38.The British multinational tobacco company is attracting the attention of investors not only for its modest valuation, but for a compelling combination of earnings yield and forward dividend yield.The earnings yield is 49.5% and the forward dividend yield is 5.72%.The first metric reflects a higher yield than the 4.45% spot rate on the 20-year high quality market (HQM) corporate bonds. The HQM corporate bonds refer to the securities representing corporate loans issued by triple-A, double-A and single-A rated companies and with a maturity of 20 years. Value investors usually seek stocks with earnings yields at least double the spot rate on 20-year HQM corporate bonds.The forward dividend yield is based on the closing share price of Sept. 10 and on the forward annual dividend of $2.72. The forward annual dividend is the result of a cash quarterly dividend of 68 cents assumed to be kept constant for the next four quarters. The forward dividend yield of British American Tobacco is higher than the S&P 500 current yield of 1.77% and the 10-year yield on U.S. Treasury bond of 2.9%.British American Tobacco has an important history of paying dividends to its shareholders. Even though the distribution has been erratic, the company has been paying shareholders for almost 35 years already. Therefore, the British tobacco giant is a loyal dividend payer.British American Tobacco is headquartered in London and is the third largest publicly traded tobacco company in the world, preceded by Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) with a market capitalization of $121.84 billion and by Altria Group Inc. (MO) with a market capitalization of $114.2 billion.British American Tobacco is a worldwide provider of cigarettes and other tobacco products. It also produces tobacco heating products and vapor, moist snuff brands and other oral products such as snus, and markets cigars and e-cigarettes.The strategic portfolio of cigarettes includes brands: Kent, Dunhill, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Rothmans. These were previously known as the Global Drive Brands. British American Tobacco is a market leader in more than 50 countries, sells its products to retail stores and has operations in over 180 countries.British American Tobacco closed full fiscal 2017 with revenue of 20.292 billion British pounds, ($27.4 billion), operating income of 6.476 billion British pounds ($8.7 billion) and net income of 37.704 British pounds ($50.87 billion). The net income includes the contribution of the businesses that British American Tobacco acquired during the year, which are Reynolds American, Bulgartabac, Winnington and Fabrika Duhana Sarajevo.The company has grown its revenue at an average annual rate of 9.8% over the last three years versus an industry median of 4.1%. Over the last three years, British American Tobacco has seen its normalized earnings per share at an annual average rate of 122.3% versus an industry median growth rate of 9.1%.GuruFocus has assigned a profitability & growth rating of 8 out of 10. That is concerning the past.Regarding the future, consensus forecasts are that the revenue will grow 16.3% to $31.857 billion this year, 5% to $33.455 billion in 2019 and 3.4% to $34.584 billion in 2020. Earnings per share without non-recurring items is forecasted to be $3.33 in 2018, $3.70 in 2019 and $4.01 in 2020.The balance sheet of the company has $3.06 billion in cash on hand and securities and total debt of $64.13 billion. The huge financial burden is not a problem for British American Tobacco for several reasons: The interest coverage ratio of 5.53 is indicating that it is not having any problem in paying the interest expense on the outstanding debt, and over 90% of the trailing 12-month free cash flow is levered. That means that the outflows for debt repayment needs is outclassed by the impressive magnitude of the cash flow that the company can generate every 12 months from its operations.GuruFocus gives the company a financial strength of 5 out of 10.Disclosure: I have no positions in any security mentioned in this article.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.Warning!

While AMT might seem like a stock to avoid or sell if you own it, it is important to understand the assumptions behind the P/E ratio before you make any investment decisions. In this article, I will explain what the P/E ratio is as well as what you should look out for when using it. Check out our latest analysis for American Tower (REIT)The P/E ratio is a popular ratio used in relative valuation since earnings power is a key driver of investment value. By comparing a stock’s price per share to its earnings per share, we are able to see how much investors are paying for each dollar of the company’s earnings.P/E Calculation for AMTPrice-Earnings Ratio = Price per share ÷ Earnings per shareAMT Price-Earnings Ratio = $140.17 ÷ $2.653 = 52.8xOn its own, the P/E ratio doesn’t tell you much; however, it becomes extremely useful when you compare it with other similar companies. We want to compare the stock’s P/E ratio to the average of companies that have similar characteristics as AMT, such as size and country of operation. One way of gathering a peer group is to use firms in the same industry, which is what I’ll do. AMT’s P/E of 52.8x is higher than its industry peers (22.7x), which implies that each dollar of AMT’s earnings is being overvalued by investors. As such, our analysis shows that AMT represents an over-priced stock.Before you jump to the conclusion that AMT should be banished from your portfolio, it is important to realise that our conclusion rests on two assertions. Firstly, our peer group contains companies that are similar to AMT. If this isn’t the case, the difference in P/E could be due to other factors. For example, if you compared higher growth firms with AMT, then its P/E would naturally be lower since investors would reward its peers’ higher growth with a higher price. The second assumption that must hold true is that the stocks we are comparing AMT to are fairly valued by the market. If this does not hold, there is a possibility that AMT’s P/E is lower because our peer group is overvalued by the market. To help readers see pass the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data. Note that our analysis does not factor in the latest price sensitive company announcements.

The firm won summary judgment for pharmaceutical client Sandoz in a case with implications for companies duties regarding medication guides, and it is national counsel for Valeant Pharmaceuticals in cases over its talcum powder product, securing a series of positive results in various jurisdictions. And in a pro bono case that took five years to complete, the firm got a favorable appellate result on behalf of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, which faced claims of breach of contract and fraud.Kirkland & Ellis took home the award for Best Law Firm of the Year, surpassing a group of competitors comprised of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton; Cooley; Cravath, Swaine & Moore; Davis Polk & Wardwell; Hogan Lovells; and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.An incredible 19 percent leap in revenue in 2017 helped Kirkland pass the $3 billion mark and overtake Latham & Watkins as the biggest law firm in the world, but that was just one facet of a remarkable run. The firm delivered more than 126,000 hours of pro bono work, including its representation of transgender members of the military in striking down President Donald Trump’s ban on their service, and its work helping overturn Maryland’s segregated higher-education system.Kirkland handled Seadrill Ltd.’s $20 billion restructuring and Energy Future Holdings Corp.’s $18.8 billion merger with Sempra Energy. The firm delivered a series of victories for General Motors in litigation tied to its ignition switch and other recalls, and represented Allergan in a host of investigations, inquiries and civil suits related to its sale and marketing of opioid painkillers. Amid all of that, the firm also maintained its spot atop league tables for M&A, and continued to capitalize on the private equity boom.Grace Speights of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius was named Attorney of the Year for her work tied to the #MeToo movement.""We could not have done this without the many clients who are willing to engage us to handle some of the most sensitive employment matters they will ever have,"" she said.Meanwhile, The American Lawyer's Lifetime Achievement Award honorees—Cesar Alvarez of Greenberg Traurig, A.B. Culvahouse Jr. of O'Melveny & Myers, Jamie Gorelick of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, Eric Holder of Covington & Burling, Mary Ann Hynes of Dentons, and Richard Riley of Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough—and Law Firm Distinguished Leader honoree Warren Gorrell of Hogan Lovells were all on hand.""This is an interesting time for our nation,"" Holder said, ""and we have the capacity to ensure that the rule of law is not eroded.""He echoed Martin Luther King Jr.'s notion that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice, urging those in attendance to ""figure out a way to put your hands on that arc and pull it toward justice.""Culvahouse shared a similar sentiment, telling the crowd that ""those of us fortunate enough to practice at the very pinnacle of our profession have a great duty to serve our country.""And Alvarez, reflecting on his childhood as a refugee from Cuba and his father's insistence that the family would repay the United States for what it had provided his family, said, ""In the winter of my life, when I look back, I can say that we as a family fulfilled that promise.""The rest of the winners from the event included:Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe makes innovation an important part of its approach from top to bottom. Through Orrick Labs, the firm is working to help develop the legal technology it can’t find in the market, ensuring that it can stay ahead of the curve even as the industry continues to change.Norton Rose Fulbright's in-house data analysis platform, NSight, can bypass the need for forensic consultants, bringing all the necessary information closer to its legal team. They firm has used NSight to simplify the defense of complex litigation, communicate among multiple teams and client contacts, measure against industry benchmarks, analyze risk and navigate data in a secure, privileged environment. It’s just the type of technology that’s helping to push law firms forward.In seeking a legal services provider outside the traditional paradigm, the organization uprooting the old model was the clear winner. Through its landmark deal with DXC Technology, UnitedLex helped reduce legal operating costs by 30 percent, and may have created a new path forward for in-house departments looking for change.In 2016, 7-Eleven had over 10,000 properties in the U.S. and Canada and a small team of real estate attorneys to handle its real estate portfolio. With its real estate portfolio expanding, changes needed to be made, which led to a collaboration with Seyfarth Shaw that allowed for uniformity in how real estate for the convenience store chain is handled across the country. In addition to handling a large share of the real estate portfolio, Seyfarth streamlined the process by creating a hub that exclusively works on title and survey review for 7-Eleven.Using data analytics, creative fee arrangements, a business intelligence dashboard and more, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius' 40-member business team is bringing together staff members with backgrounds in pricing, project management, finance, math, IT, process mapping and design to benefit both the firm and its clients. Together, they’re building the relationships that form the foundation of every good firm.Ask the people who’ve worked with Apple associate general counsel Jim Fowler over the years and they’ll tell you he leads by example. His work ethic is enough to leave an impression on those coming up behind him, but he goes above and beyond by devoting time and energy to improving the careers of his colleagues, even when they move on to different workplaces. As one former colleague said, he’s “never too busy to answer a question and always had an open-door policy.”As the longtime head of his firm’s professional development program, Joshua Vincent of Hinshaw & Culbertson is known as the dean of Hinshaw University, which has seen roughly 500 attorneys pass through its doors under his guidance. Over the years, he’s designed a program that sends every new attorney at the firm to weeklong boot camps for basic skills and trial advocacy, building better lawyers and getting their careers off to a strong start.Keker, Van Nest & Peters may be considerably smaller than most of the firms it goes up against, but it gets big results. Those results include defending Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong in a $100 million False Claims Act case that settled for a small fraction of that sum; winning a nationwide injunction against President Trump’s attempt to defund sanctuary jurisdictions; and obtaining a settlement on behalf of Lyft that allows its drivers to remain classified as independent contractors. When it comes to litigation, the firm shows that size isn’t everything.California: After a former engineer at Uber published allegations of sexual harassment during her time with the company, Uber turned to Covington & Burling and Eric Holder to conduct the ensuing investigation. Uber’s board unanimously approved the firm’s recommendations. And when the Department of Justice tried to link federal funding to a jurisdiction’s willingness to cooperate with ICE on immigration matters, the firms’ lawyers secured a national injunction in the Central District of California. In a powerful opinion, the firm succeeded on each argument it put forward on behalf of the city of Los Angeles.Florida: Holland & Knight's lawyers secured a $23 million result for the estate of Subway’s founder in a real estate dispute, protected the Dominican Republic’s water resources agency from a $35 million breach of contract suit, and defended Nicklaus Children’s Hospital and a group of physicians against claims that they tried to build a hospital empire at the expense of independent physician groups. The firm also defended Norwegian Cruise Lines and its CEO in a $90 million defamation suit, and secured better treatment for mentally ill inmates incarcerated by the Florida Department of Corrections.New Jersey: More than 30 years ago, Blank Rome became the first out-of-state firm to open an office in New Jersey, and today the firm has established itself as a litigation leader in the Garden State. Over the past couple of years, the firm helped TGI Friday’s overturn a 13-million-member class certification in a case over drink pricing, secured a precedential decision on personal jurisdiction on behalf of WolfBlock, successfully defended PennyMac Loan Services from a consumer class action, and received favorable settlements for pro bono clients in civil rights cases.Pennsylvania: Over the past year, Morgan Lewis has been at the center of the conversation on sexual harassment defined by the #MeToo movement. Among other investigations over the past year, the firm handled NPR’s review of allegations against its senior vice president of news, ultimately making public its finished report and becoming a leader on the issue. The firm also secured for Uber dismissal of an antitrust suit from Philadelphia’s taxi drivers, a case that was affirmed at the Third Circuit. And following a Supreme Court ruling on juveniles sentenced to life without parole, the firm brought hope to two men that they might one day live outside of a prison.Texas: Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher is a national firm, but its Texas litigation practice functions like a local one. Among its large local clients, the firm co-led the defense of AT&T’s $108 billion acquisition of Time Warner against an antitrust challenge from the Department of Justice, and secured a victory for Fort Worth-based BNSF Railway in a multibillion-dollar price-fixing class action. The firm also won a take-nothing judgment in an $8 billion bet-the-company arbitration for construction clients Bechtel Corp. and Jacobs Engineering, and convinced the EPA to voluntarily dismiss all Clean Air Act claims against Texas-based Luminant Energy.Finance Winner: Oi S.A.'s restructuringLitigation/Dispute Resolution Winner: Dow/DuPont antitrust effortsM&A Winner: CVS's acquisition of AetnaPro Bono Winner: Reed Smith's efforts to address refugee crisesDiversity ChampionWhite & CasePro Bono ChampionJenner & BlockTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

(NASDAQ: AMGN) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) actually have quite a bit in common. They co-market one of the world's best-selling drugs, Enbrel. They both face some headwinds with declining sales of older drugs. Each company has promising new drugs. And both stocks are up by nearly the same percentage over the last 12 months.Do Amgen and Pfizer present the same opportunities for investors? No. One stock appears to have an edge, but which one? Here's how Amgen and Pfizer stack up against each other.Image source: Getty Images.You might think that Amgen's current status looks pretty dire if you only looked at its current top products. Mylan recently won FDA approval for a biosimilar to Amgen's best-selling drug, Neulasta. Amgen's other top blockbuster, Enbrel, faces stiff competition. Anemia drug Epogen now must compete against a new biosimilar on the market, which could impact sales for Aranesp as well. Secondary-hyperparathyroidism treatment Sensipar lost a key U.S. patent in March.But while Amgen certainly faces challenges, the biotech also has a stable of products with solid growth prospects. Sales for osteoporosis drugs Prolia and Xgeva continue to enjoy strong momentum. Amgen's multiple myeloma therapy Kyprolis and its cholesterol drug Repatha should have plenty of upside potential. The biotech won FDA approval in May for Aimovig, a migraine drug that is projected to become a blockbuster for Amgen and partner Novartis.Amgen hopes to profit from its biosimilar lineup as well. In October, the company will begin marketing Amjevita, a biosimilar to the world's top-selling drug, Humira, in European markets. Kanjinti, a biosimilar to chemotherapy Herceptin, received a recommendation for approval by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.Market research firm EvaluatePharma recently ranked Amgen's pipeline as the fifth-best in the biopharmaceutical industry. That ranking was finalized before Aimovig won FDA approval, so the drug played an important part in EvaluatePharma's projections. Tezepelumab, which is being evaluated in a phase 3 clinical study targeting asthma and a phase 2 study targeting atopic dermatitis, also looks like a strong candidate with blockbuster sales potential.Amgen is one of only a handful of biotechs that pay a dividend. The company's dividend currently yields 2.85%. And the dividend has grown a lot: Amgen has boosted its dividend payout by 180% over the last five years.Pfizer also has its fair share of issues. The big drugmaker has seen sales declines for several of its older products that have lost patent exclusivity. Pfizer's sterile injectables business, acquired from Hospira in 2015, has been plagued by problems that have caused product shortages. However, these issues should weigh Pfizer down less over the next few years.Like Amgen, Pfizer has some rising stars. Sales continue to soar for breast cancer drug Ibrance. Pfizer and partner Bristol-Myers Squibb claim a huge winner with anticoagulant Eliquis. Immunology drug Xeljanz is performing very well. Pfizer should also enjoy tremendous success for its diabetes drug Steglatro and its combination products.Also like Amgen, Pfizer should get some help from its biosimilars. Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, racked up sales of $145 million in the last quarter. Pfizer won FDA approval for another Remicade biosimilar in December 2017. The company is also now poised to compete directly against Amgen, with Retacrit -- a biosimilar to Epogen -- gaining FDA approval in May 2018.Pfizer's pipeline appears to be solid as well. The company has 28 late-stage clinical programs. Several of these target additional indications for already-approved drugs. Pfizer also has some promising new candidates, with cancer drug talazoparib and pain drug tanezumab especially standing out.Investors have long been attracted to Pfizer's dividend. The dividend currently yields 3.73%. Pfizer has increased its dividend by nearly 42% over the last five years.Which of these two big drug stocks is the better pick for long-term investors? My choice is Pfizer.I think Pfizer's earnings growth will top Amgen's over the next several years. Amgen is just beginning to experience the challenges of declining sales for older products. Pfizer is moving past its similar challenges. I also look for better performance from Pfizer's pipeline than the company has seen in recent years. Pfizer's higher dividend yield also is an important consideration.Amgen is a solid company that should be a winner over the long run. However, the big biotech could have its work cut out for it at a time when Pfizer appears to be ready to blossom.

The APA sponsors this annual Safety & Health awards program to showcase ongoing mill safety enhancement efforts and share them within the industry.The innovation category is designed to recognize a novel, grassroots solution that is proven to reduce on-the-job injuries or improve safety awareness. There are two categories: process-based innovations and equipment-based innovations, and Boise Cascade swept both for 2017!""These awards represent the continuing cultural shift towards a proactive safety program at Boise Cascade,"" said Terry Evans, Wood Products Division Safety Manager. ""We have been on an improvement journey for several years, and now the hard work of our teams in the mills has netted two innovations awards in a single year.""The Boise Cascade Plywood Mill in Oakdale, Louisiana earned first place for creating an in-house safety video. The dryer grading training video covers topics such as using personal protective equipment, properly grading and stacking veneer, high-pressure dryer hazards, and splinter reduction, which had become an incident trend in this part of the mill. As a result of the training, the injury trends are reversing.The Veneer Mill in Willamina, Oregon won for a home-grown equipment innovation. The mill was encountering increasing incidents from veneer debris flying off the machinery due to its belt speed. The mill safety committee brainstormed solutions to address the issue, which resulted in a millwright employee designing, building and installing an innovative device that effectively held down the material on the belt to eliminate the airborne hazard.There were several other highlights on the APA`s Safety & Health Honor Roll. Boise Cascade`s plywood mills in Chester, Kettle Falls and Elgin had the lowest, second lowest and third lowest (respectively) weighted incident rates. Weighted incident rate is a combination of incident severity and frequency. Boise Cascade`s plywood mills were five of the lowest six mills per weighted incident rate, all of which were at or below the industry average weighted incident rate of 8.43, and the top four mills were below the industry total incident rate (the traditional OSHA recordable rate) of 1.77. The Chester mill garnered another award for being the most improved mill over a three year period.""We congratulate Boise Cascade on their achievements in the 2017 APA Safety and Health Awards program,"" said Ed Elias, APA President. ""The objective of this awards program is to work with the manufacturers to ensure that all employees go home to their families at the end of each shift, safe and healthy. To that end, the innovations that Boise Cascade introduced in their facilities, and the stellar records achieved in the plywood mills, speak to a strong corporate commitment to the safety and well-being of all employees.""APA staff will travel to the mill locations to present the awards, as well as recognize these safety accomplishments at the annual meeting later this year.Boise Cascade is one of the largest producers of engineered wood products and plywood in North America and a leading U.S. wholesale distributor of building products.

The firm’s market cap currently stands at around $926.9 Billion and its revenues and free cash flows for the previous financial year were approximately $247.4 Billion and $53.7 Billion respectively. The company’s common stock has fluctuated between a high of $190 and a low of $142 over the past 52 weeks and currently stands at around $188. Is Apple Inc. undervalued at the current price?To determine the intrinsic value of Apple Inc., we’ll begin by looking at the company’s history of free cash flow. A company’s free cash flow is the true earnings which management can either reinvest for growth or distribute back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Below is a chart of Apple Inc.’s free cash flow for the past ten years.As one can see, the company’s free cash flow has grown substantially over the last ten years at an annualized rate of around 22%. In order to determine Apple Inc.’s intrinsic value, an estimate must be made of its potential future free cash flows. To build this estimate, there is an array of potential outcomes for future free cash flows in the graph below.When examining the array of lines moving into the future, each one represents a certain probability of occurrence. The upper-bound line represents a 12% growth rate which represents the analyst consensus for Apple Inc.’s future 5-year growth. The author has used this in lieu of Apple Inc.’s 22% growth rate for the last ten years. This is because companies can seldom maintain such a high growth rate for prolonged periods. This growth rate has been assigned a 10% probability of occurrence to account for a number of factors including the rapid rate of change within the technology industry, the high level of competition, and the increasing risk of market saturation.The middle growth line represents a 7% growth rate which is based on the firm’s historical revenue growth for the previous five years. This has been used as earnings tend to revert toward this rate of growth as a company matures. This scenario has been assigned an 80% probability of occurrence in light of the potential risks outlined above.The lower bound line represents a 2% rate in free cash flow growth and assumes that the company grows in line with current average estimates for GDP growth in the United States for the next ten years. This scenario has been assigned a 10% probability as Apple Inc. and the technology industry’s trend toward innovation is likely to translate into a higher rate of growth than that of the wider economy.Assuming these potential outcomes and corresponding cash flows are accurately represented, Apple Inc. might be priced at a 7.4% annual return if the company can be purchased at today’s price. We’ll now look at another valuation metric to see if it corresponds with this estimate.Based on Apple Inc.’s current earnings yield, which is the inverse of its EV/EBIT ratio, the company is currently yielding 7.41%. This is below the firm’s 10-year historical median of 9.20% but above the Global Consumer Electronics Industry median average of 4.22%. This suggests that the company may be marginally overvalued relative to its historical average yet undervalued on a comparable basis. Finally, we’ll look at Apple Inc.’s free cash flow yield, a metric which assumes zero growth and simply measures the firm’s trailing free cash against its current market price. At the current market price, Apple Inc. has a free cash flow yield of 5.8%.Taking all these points into consideration, it seems reasonable to assume that Apple Inc. is currently trading at a marginal premium to fair value. Furthermore, the company may return around 7% at the current price if the estimated free cash flows are achieved. Now, let’s discuss how and why these estimated free cash flows could be achieved.Apple Inc. has various competitive advantages outlined below.Brand Value. One of Apple Inc.’s most powerful competitive advantage is undoubtedly its brand value. According to the Brand consultancy firm ‘Brand Finance,’ Apple currently holds to the No. 2 position on the 2018 Global 500 list with an estimated brand value of $146.3 Billion. In order for a competitor to challenge Apple Inc.’s competitive position, they would have to deploy a huge amount of capital and resources.Figure 1: Source: Brand Finance, 2018 Global 500This brand value helps to differentiate Apple Inc.’s products thus granting it pricing power with consumers. This pricing power allows the company to outperform the industry on a number of key metrics.High Switching Cost. By developing its own operating systems, marketplaces, and customer support, Apple Inc. has created what is known as a “walled garden.” This closed ecosystem has allowed the firm to create and maintain a captive user base and enables it to more successfully sell value-added services. This means that Apple Inc.’s users are much less likely to switch to an alternative as the company’s technology has become so embedded in their lives.Sophisticated Supply Chain. Apple Inc. has established a network of suppliers, developers, and business partners to create a sophisticated supply chain. The firm owns chip manufacturers, a global network of over 470 branded stores and has a community of over 6 million developers creating applications for its products. The company has also implemented data synchronization between central warehouses, its stores, and customers, and reduced the manufacturing cycle time in order to drive efficiencies. By having control over the entire process of product development, manufacturing, and marketing, Apple Inc. is able to run an extremely efficient and cost-effective supply chain which competitors find difficult to imitate. Figure 2: Apple Inc. Supply Chain. Source; Supplychain247.comNow that Apple Inc.’s competitive advantages have been considered, let’s look at some of the risk factors that could impair my assumptions of investment return.The consumer electronics industry in which Apple Inc. operates is highly competitive. The firm faces competition from a number of companies such as Alphabet, Samsung, and Microsoft. These companies possess their own competitive advantages and the necessary resources to mount a serious challenge against Apple Inc. If one of them can successfully breach its moat, this would be highly detrimental to the company’s future growth prospects. The consumer electronics and the broader technology industry is subject to rapid change and companies must continuously innovate or risk obsolescence through the process of “creative destruction.” If Apple Inc. is unable to successfully innovate new products, it may find its ability to generate future revenues and earnings impeded. Successful innovation requires an ongoing commitment to R&D spending and constant attention to market research and customer feedback. Apple Inc. has come under criticism for its implementation of a closed platform or “walled garden” to ensure a captive user group. If the firm is forced, either by regulatory or public pressure, to open up its platform, it is likely to see its moat weaken and its ability to successfully market and sell value-added products could be compromised.Whenever an investment is considered, one must compare it to any alternatives to weigh up the opportunity cost. At the time of writing, 10-year treasuries are yielding 2.96%. If we take inflation into account, the real return is likely to be closer to 1%. The S&P 500 Index is currently trading at a Shiller P/E of 32.1 which is 89.9% higher than the historical mean of 16.8. Assuming reversion to the mean occurs, the implied future annual return is likely to be -2.8%. Apple Inc., therefore, appears to offer a much better return for investors at present but other individual stocks may be found which offer a similar return relative to the risk profile.Investors must consider macroeconomic factors that may impact economic and market performance as this could influence investment returns. At the time of writing, the S&P is priced at a Shiller P/E of 32.1. This is 89.9% higher than the historical average of 16.8, suggesting markets are at elevated levels. U.S. unemployment figures are at a 30-year low suggesting that the current business cycle is nearing its peak. U.S. private debt/GDP currently stands at 199.6% and is at its highest point since 2009 when the last financial crisis prompted private sector deleveraging.The future for Apple Inc. is by no means certain given that it operates in a highly dynamic and competitive industry. The market has and continues to price the company at a lower multiple than the other tech giants such as Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook – the reason being that Apple Inc.’s moat is not as wide as these other firms and it currently has a heavy reliance on users continuously upgrading to the latest model of its products to remain relevant.Defendants of the company can rightly argue that the firm has taken steps to build a network effect through third-party developers building on its IOS, and that it has risen switching costs via the introduction of the iCloud but the company’s moat is not as wide as the other tech giants. Alphabet owns a “share of your mind” through Google which has become a synonym for “search engine.” The switching costs to replace Microsoft’s suite of products is enormous given how embedded it is in the operations of companies and individuals. As for Facebook, its network effect makes it an incredibly sticky business and its huge user database means it can generate substantial earnings from digital advertising.If Apple Inc. can repeat its past successes with bringing revolutionary products to market, it can open up new avenues for growth to drive future revenues and earnings. The key question is “can the company can continue to expand its moat or is it likely to narrow?”With regards to shareholder friendliness, Apple Inc. has been returning value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases whilst maintaining its R&D operations to ensure the development of new technologies. Between FY 2012 and Q2 2018, the company has returned $275.2 Billion in capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. In that time, the company has also grown its dividend by an annualized rate of around 37% and reduced its share count at an annualized rate of 3.83%.In summary, Apple Inc.’s future is likely to involve a slowing in growth as market saturation of the company’s products occurs, and the law of large numbers comes into play. If, however, the company is able to bring new innovative products to market, such as the hotly touted iCar, there exists the possibility that the firm could silence the naysayers and open up whole new avenues of revenue and earnings growth.

The firm’s market cap currently stands at around $926.9 Billion and its revenues and free cash flows for the previous financial year were approximately $247.4 Billion and $53.7 Billion respectively. The company’s common stock has fluctuated between a high of $190 and a low of $142 over the past 52 weeks and currently stands at around $188. Is Apple Inc. undervalued at the current price?To determine the intrinsic value of Apple Inc., we’ll begin by looking at the company’s history of free cash flow. A company’s free cash flow is the true earnings which management can either reinvest for growth or distribute back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Below is a chart of Apple Inc.’s free cash flow for the past ten years.As one can see, the company’s free cash flow has grown substantially over the last ten years at an annualized rate of around 22%. In order to determine Apple Inc.’s intrinsic value, an estimate must be made of its potential future free cash flows. To build this estimate, there is an array of potential outcomes for future free cash flows in the graph below.When examining the array of lines moving into the future, each one represents a certain probability of occurrence. The upper-bound line represents a 12% growth rate which represents the analyst consensus for Apple Inc.’s future 5-year growth. The author has used this in lieu of Apple Inc.’s 22% growth rate for the last ten years. This is because companies can seldom maintain such a high growth rate for prolonged periods. This growth rate has been assigned a 10% probability of occurrence to account for a number of factors including the rapid rate of change within the technology industry, the high level of competition, and the increasing risk of market saturation.The middle growth line represents a 7% growth rate which is based on the firm’s historical revenue growth for the previous five years. This has been used as earnings tend to revert toward this rate of growth as a company matures. This scenario has been assigned an 80% probability of occurrence in light of the potential risks outlined above.The lower bound line represents a 2% rate in free cash flow growth and assumes that the company grows in line with current average estimates for GDP growth in the United States for the next ten years. This scenario has been assigned a 10% probability as Apple Inc. and the technology industry’s trend toward innovation is likely to translate into a higher rate of growth than that of the wider economy.Assuming these potential outcomes and corresponding cash flows are accurately represented, Apple Inc. might be priced at a 7.4% annual return if the company can be purchased at today’s price. We’ll now look at another valuation metric to see if it corresponds with this estimate.Based on Apple Inc.’s current earnings yield, which is the inverse of its EV/EBIT ratio, the company is currently yielding 7.41%. This is below the firm’s 10-year historical median of 9.20% but above the Global Consumer Electronics Industry median average of 4.22%. This suggests that the company may be marginally overvalued relative to its historical average yet undervalued on a comparable basis. Finally, we’ll look at Apple Inc.’s free cash flow yield, a metric which assumes zero growth and simply measures the firm’s trailing free cash against its current market price. At the current market price, Apple Inc. has a free cash flow yield of 5.8%.Taking all these points into consideration, it seems reasonable to assume that Apple Inc. is currently trading at a marginal premium to fair value. Furthermore, the company may return around 7% at the current price if the estimated free cash flows are achieved. Now, let’s discuss how and why these estimated free cash flows could be achieved.Apple Inc. has various competitive advantages outlined below.Brand Value. One of Apple Inc.’s most powerful competitive advantage is undoubtedly its brand value. According to the Brand consultancy firm ‘Brand Finance,’ Apple currently holds to the No. 2 position on the 2018 Global 500 list with an estimated brand value of $146.3 Billion. In order for a competitor to challenge Apple Inc.’s competitive position, they would have to deploy a huge amount of capital and resources.Figure 1: Source: Brand Finance, 2018 Global 500This brand value helps to differentiate Apple Inc.’s products thus granting it pricing power with consumers. This pricing power allows the company to outperform the industry on a number of key metrics.High Switching Cost. By developing its own operating systems, marketplaces, and customer support, Apple Inc. has created what is known as a “walled garden.” This closed ecosystem has allowed the firm to create and maintain a captive user base and enables it to more successfully sell value-added services. This means that Apple Inc.’s users are much less likely to switch to an alternative as the company’s technology has become so embedded in their lives.Sophisticated Supply Chain. Apple Inc. has established a network of suppliers, developers, and business partners to create a sophisticated supply chain. The firm owns chip manufacturers, a global network of over 470 branded stores and has a community of over 6 million developers creating applications for its products. The company has also implemented data synchronization between central warehouses, its stores, and customers, and reduced the manufacturing cycle time in order to drive efficiencies. By having control over the entire process of product development, manufacturing, and marketing, Apple Inc. is able to run an extremely efficient and cost-effective supply chain which competitors find difficult to imitate. Figure 2: Apple Inc. Supply Chain. Source; Supplychain247.comNow that Apple Inc.’s competitive advantages have been considered, let’s look at some of the risk factors that could impair my assumptions of investment return.The consumer electronics industry in which Apple Inc. operates is highly competitive. The firm faces competition from a number of companies such as Alphabet, Samsung, and Microsoft. These companies possess their own competitive advantages and the necessary resources to mount a serious challenge against Apple Inc. If one of them can successfully breach its moat, this would be highly detrimental to the company’s future growth prospects. The consumer electronics and the broader technology industry is subject to rapid change and companies must continuously innovate or risk obsolescence through the process of “creative destruction.” If Apple Inc. is unable to successfully innovate new products, it may find its ability to generate future revenues and earnings impeded. Successful innovation requires an ongoing commitment to R&D spending and constant attention to market research and customer feedback. Apple Inc. has come under criticism for its implementation of a closed platform or “walled garden” to ensure a captive user group. If the firm is forced, either by regulatory or public pressure, to open up its platform, it is likely to see its moat weaken and its ability to successfully market and sell value-added products could be compromised.Whenever an investment is considered, one must compare it to any alternatives to weigh up the opportunity cost. At the time of writing, 10-year treasuries are yielding 2.96%. If we take inflation into account, the real return is likely to be closer to 1%. The S&P 500 Index is currently trading at a Shiller P/E of 32.1 which is 89.9% higher than the historical mean of 16.8. Assuming reversion to the mean occurs, the implied future annual return is likely to be -2.8%. Apple Inc., therefore, appears to offer a much better return for investors at present but other individual stocks may be found which offer a similar return relative to the risk profile.Investors must consider macroeconomic factors that may impact economic and market performance as this could influence investment returns. At the time of writing, the S&P is priced at a Shiller P/E of 32.1. This is 89.9% higher than the historical average of 16.8, suggesting markets are at elevated levels. U.S. unemployment figures are at a 30-year low suggesting that the current business cycle is nearing its peak. U.S. private debt/GDP currently stands at 199.6% and is at its highest point since 2009 when the last financial crisis prompted private sector deleveraging.The future for Apple Inc. is by no means certain given that it operates in a highly dynamic and competitive industry. The market has and continues to price the company at a lower multiple than the other tech giants such as Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook – the reason being that Apple Inc.’s moat is not as wide as these other firms and it currently has a heavy reliance on users continuously upgrading to the latest model of its products to remain relevant.Defendants of the company can rightly argue that the firm has taken steps to build a network effect through third-party developers building on its IOS, and that it has risen switching costs via the introduction of the iCloud but the company’s moat is not as wide as the other tech giants. Alphabet owns a “share of your mind” through Google which has become a synonym for “search engine.” The switching costs to replace Microsoft’s suite of products is enormous given how embedded it is in the operations of companies and individuals. As for Facebook, its network effect makes it an incredibly sticky business and its huge user database means it can generate substantial earnings from digital advertising.If Apple Inc. can repeat its past successes with bringing revolutionary products to market, it can open up new avenues for growth to drive future revenues and earnings. The key question is “can the company can continue to expand its moat or is it likely to narrow?”With regards to shareholder friendliness, Apple Inc. has been returning value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases whilst maintaining its R&D operations to ensure the development of new technologies. Between FY 2012 and Q2 2018, the company has returned $275.2 Billion in capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. In that time, the company has also grown its dividend by an annualized rate of around 37% and reduced its share count at an annualized rate of 3.83%.In summary, Apple Inc.’s future is likely to involve a slowing in growth as market saturation of the company’s products occurs, and the law of large numbers comes into play. If, however, the company is able to bring new innovative products to market, such as the hotly touted iCar, there exists the possibility that the firm could silence the naysayers and open up whole new avenues of revenue and earnings growth. On a historical basis, Apple Inc. appears to be trading at a marginal premium to fair value, yet on a comparable basis, it appears to be undervalued by the market.Based on the conservative assumptions used in the free cash flow analysis, the author concludes that Apple Inc. may return around 7% at the current market price.Disclaimer: The author does not hold ownership in any of the companies mentioned at the time of writing this article.*This article was written in collaboration with David J.

(AAPL) became the first publicly-traded U.S. company with a $1 trillion market cap, as its stock ticked up over $207.05 on Thursday, 42 years after its founding in Steve Jobs’s garage in Los Altos, Calif. But its co-founder and initial computer science genius, Steve Wozniak, reached in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, took the news in stride.“Of course I’m proud of Apple, but I don’t measure the world by human simplifications like round numbers,” Wozniak told Yahoo Finance in an email. “A company is great because it is great.”Wozniak, known as Woz, stepped away from his day-to-day role at Apple in 1985, but is technically still an employee who gets a check. (He has said it’s small.) In his varied career he created the first universal remote, helped found the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and had other entrepreneurial projects.For Wozniak, other moments in the company’s history hold far more cachet than Thursday’s crossing of the $1 trillion mark, but he says he has no favorite one.“So many, even small and unnoticed steps meant a lot to me personally. But most would probably agree that Steve Jobs’s return was the key element, even though our valuation didn’t go up until the iPod,” he said. When Apple first traded as a public company in 1980, a share cost $0.47 and the company’s market cap was $1.8 billion. In 1997, just before Jobs returned as CEO, Apple’s stock had been fluctuating, falling under $1.7 billion.Wozniak took a moment to point to Apple’s data practices in the wake of increased public scrutiny over tech giants like Facebook’s and Google’s approaches to information collection on its users.“We are a company based on great products, and we don’t have to invade your privacy to do it,” he said.–Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, retail, and personal finance.

Superficially, this looks great since we know that AAPL has generated big profits with little equity capital; however, ROE doesn’t tell us how much AAPL has borrowed in debt. Today, we’ll take a closer look at some factors like financial leverage to see how sustainable AAPL’s ROE is. See our latest analysis for AppleFirstly, Return on Equity, or ROE, is simply the percentage of last years’ earning against the book value of shareholders’ equity. For example, if the company invests $1 in the form of equity, it will generate $0.42 in earnings from this. In most cases, a higher ROE is preferred; however, there are many other factors we must consider prior to making any investment decisions.Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders EquityROE is measured against cost of equity in order to determine the efficiency of Apple’s equity capital deployed. Its cost of equity is 10.61%. Since Apple’s return covers its cost in excess of 31.41%, its use of equity capital is efficient and likely to be sustainable. Simply put, Apple pays less for its capital than what it generates in return. ROE can be split up into three useful ratios: net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. This is called the Dupont Formula:ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverageROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity)ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equityBasically, profit margin measures how much of revenue trickles down into earnings which illustrates how efficient the business is with its cost management. The other component, asset turnover, illustrates how much revenue Apple can make from its asset base. Finally, financial leverage will be our main focus today. It shows how much of assets are funded by equity and can show how sustainable the company’s capital structure is. Since financial leverage can artificially inflate ROE, we need to look at how much debt Apple currently has. At 96.03%, Apple’s debt-to-equity ratio appears balanced and indicates the above-average ROE is generated from its capacity to increase profit without a large debt burden.ROE is one of many ratios which meaningfully dissects financial statements, which illustrates the quality of a company. Apple’s ROE is impressive relative to the industry average and also covers its cost of equity. Its high ROE is not likely to be driven by high debt. Therefore, investors may have more confidence in the sustainability of this level of returns going forward. Although ROE can be a useful metric, it is only a small part of diligent research.For Apple, I’ve compiled three essential factors you should look at:Financial Health: Does it have a healthy balance sheet?

As the iPhone maker's foreign cash reserves have continued to grow to epic proportions, that cash has to go somewhere. At the end of last quarter, total cash was a whopping $285.1 billion, of which $269 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries.Also included in the total figure is nearly $157 billion in corporate bonds. Most of those bonds ($129 billion) are considered long term, maturing at least a year from now, with just $27 billion being classified as short term. However, with the company now planning on repatriating a substantial portion of its foreign reserves -- CFO Luca Maestri will share more specific details next quarter -- Apple has already ramped down its bond investing activities.Image source: Apple.Bloomberg reports that along with other tech giants that are preparing to repatriate cash, Apple has stopped participating in many bond offerings, citing anonymous sources. There are broader implications for the corporate bond market as Apple starts to ramp down its bond investing, seeing as how it's such a huge buyer of paper that it makes it a significant lender to other companies.Overall borrowing costs could start to rise. The oversubscription rate has also fallen so far this year as a result, with tech companies reportedly only buying a sixth of what they normally purchase, according to the report.Apple's corporate bond holdings (measured at fair value) have soared by nearly 60% over the past three years.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown.These holdings aren't likely to increase much going forward, if at all.On last week's earnings call, Maestri also noted that the company plans on bringing its net cash position down to zero in the years ahead. Apple currently has net cash of $163 billion, which is a substantial sum to disburse. ""As you said, $163 billion is a large amount, and there are even practical considerations around it,"" Maestri added when answering an analyst question.When you consider the aforementioned composition of bond maturities within Apple's bond portfolio, you can appreciate the logistical challenges that Apple will be facing. Waiting for all those bonds to mature could take quite some time, as its long-term bonds typically mature in one to five years. The company could always sell those bonds in the secondary market, but Apple wouldn't want to sell off a massive amount of bonds because that activity would have notable market impact and hurt bond prices.""The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management,"" Apple wrote in its most recent 10-Q. Keep in mind that duration is not the same as maturity. Bond duration measures the sensitivity of bond prices in response to interest rate changes.Coordinating the liquidation and repatriation of that much cash will be no easy task.

But investors don't give the iGiant anywhere near the same level of respect as its largest tech peers.Apple is trading at an average 40% discount to Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)! And it's pretty much always been this way.AAPL PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsBut why is this the case?Some investors have resigned themselves to this reality. Others have very plausible excuses:Apple's simply too big for its own good.Apple isn't growing as fast as the other three.But while these make sense on the surface level, I simply don't think they explain the heart of the matter. There's only one plausible explanation: Apple's moat is nowhere near as wide as those of the other three, and the market knows it.It's true, Apple is the largest, most valuable company the world has ever known. With a bump of just 10%, it would become the history's first trillion-dollar organization. But while the law of large numbers does make sense on paper, Apple's not so big compared to its peers that it should necessitate such a discount.If you look at the top ten largest stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, all three of these peers sit in the top six.Data source: Finviz.comIt's also worth stating that just because a company is approaching a landmark like $1 trillion, it doesn't mean it can't stop growing from there. Indeed, because the stock market has always gone up over the long-run, all-time barriers are routinely broken. There's no reason Apple couldn't keep growing.Others will argue that Apple is simply not growing as fast as its tech peers. While that's true with Facebook, it isn't with Microsoft or Alphabet.MetricAppleAlphabetMicrosoftFacebook3-Year Revenue CAGR8%17%3%48%3-Year EPS CAGR13%9%11%53%Data source: E*Trade, SEC filings. CAGR = Compounded Annual Growth Rate. EPS figures calculated using non-GAAP figures when applicable.While Facebook is growing demonstrably faster, Apple's earnings growth has outpaced Alphabet (surprise!), and it has Microsoft beat on both top and bottom lines.And yet Apple still trades at a 40%+ discount.Before getting into the weeds, it's important we define our terms. A ""moat"" is another word for an enduring competitive advantage. In the simplest sense, a moat is what keeps customers (or users) coming back to a single company year after year, and holding the competition at bay for decades.Image source: Getty ImagesThere are four key types of economic moats, and while each company has elements of multiple moats in its business model, a single moat dominates. For the purposes of this article, that's convenient.Network Effect: I consider this the strongest of all moats. With each additional user, the value of a network becomes greater, further incentivizing more users to join. This is Facebook's key moat. As each user joins the network, others are incentivized to join, creating a virtuous cycle.High Switching Costs: If a customer will need to pay dearly to switch away from a service -- in terms of direct costs, time, or headaches in general -- they are more likely to stick with the incumbent. This is Microsoft's key moat. Users the world over have been using the Office Suite -- Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.-- for over two decades. This reliable income helps fund other initiatives.Low-Cost Production: If a company can offer a product or service for markedly lower costs than the competition -- with the same or greater value -- it will be the provider of choice. This is Alphabet's key moat. Remember, Google makes most of its money on advertising. Because it has seven products with over one billion users each -- search, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Chrome, Android, and Play Store -- it has tons of data that it gets just for maintaining these properties. Advertisers pay hand over fist for that data.Intangible Assets: This includes things like brand value, patents, and regulatory protection. This is Apple's key moat. Its brand is the most valuable in the world, and patents on in-house developed chips are a key differentiator.No moat will ever mean that a business is safe forever. As Arjun Sethi -- co-founder and CEO of MessageMe -- recently wrote: ""A moat simply buys a company time to figure out the next great business."" [emphasis in original].Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook have business models with uber-wide moats around them. It would take a herculean effort to create a social network with as much stickiness as Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp (and not get bought out by Facebook). Someone would need to wrest ""Google it"" from our lexicon to break the stranglehold that Alphabet has on our search data. And competitors have been trying for decades to create a better Excel spreadsheet.Those advantages give the leaders of these businesses an enormous head-start on figuring out the Next Big Thing.There's no questioning Apple's status in the industry. But it has to count on its users continually upgrading to the next iPhone to remain relevant. That's not exactly an enduring advantage when viewed against the protection that Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft enjoy.Don't get me wrong -- I'm an Apple shareholder myself. The company has done a great job of introducing high switching-costs via the iCloud, and it benefits from the network effect of third-party app developers building on its iOS. Its efforts in providing services have also been hugely successful.But for now, it is predominantly an iPhone maker. And it is priced accordingly. I think the price is fair -- which is why I'm holding my shares. But I have no illusions of it ever consistently trading above a P/E of 20. You shouldn't either.

Using the most recent financial data, I am going to take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced using the discounted cash flows (DCF) model. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. If you are reading this after May 2018 then I highly recommend you check out the latest calculation for Apple here.We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which simply means we have two different periods of varying growth rates for the company’s cash flows. Generally the initial phase has higher growth rates that plateau over time. To start off, I pulled together the analyst consensus forecast of AAPL’s levered free cash flow (FCF) over the next five years and discounted these figures at the cost of equity of 10.46%. This resulted in a present value of 5-year cash flow of US$234.18B. Keen to understand how I arrived at this number? Read our detailed analysis here.The infographic above illustrates how AAPL’s earnings are expected to move going forward, which should give you some color on AAPL’s outlook. Then, I calculate the terminal value, which is the business’s cash flow after the first stage. It’s appropriate to use the 10-year government bond rate of 2.8% as the steady growth rate, which is rightly below GDP growth, but more towards the conservative side. After discounting the terminal value back five years, the present value becomes US$486.10B.The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next five years and the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$720.27B. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. This results in an intrinsic value of $141.95, which, compared to the current share price of $165.26, we see that Apple is fair value, maybe slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn’t be the only metric you look at when researching a company.For AAPL, I’ve compiled three relevant aspects you should look at:Financial Health: Does AAPL have a healthy balance sheet?

In addition to the $38 billion in taxes it must pay, Apple has run up $97 billion in U.S.-issued debt to pay for previous share buybacks and dividends.Some investors said the Apple U.S. investments would give the company room to make more stock buybacks or pay dividends without criticism, and Apple shares rose 1.7 percent for the day.Walter Piecyk, managing director for TMT Research at BTIG Research, said he could not yet tell whether the U.S. expansion was an increase from a previous plan or meant investment abroad was being refocused in the United States. Reuters Breakingviews estimated that Apple could have increased U.S. headcount by 24,000 in the last five years.Trump described the move by Apple as victory for his policies.""I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States. Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.APPLE SERVICES PUSHAbout a third of Apple's new spending will be on data centers to house its iCloud, App Store and Apple Music services, a sign of the rising importance of subscription services to a company known for its computers and gadgets. The company has data centers in seven states.The announced U.S spending would be a significant part of Apple's overall capital expenditures. Globally, the company spent $14.9 billion in 2017 and expects to spend $16 billion in 2018, figures that include both U.S.-based investments in data centers and other projects and Asian investments in tooling for its contract manufacturers.If Apple's overall capital expenditures continue to expand at the same rate expected this year, the $30 billion investment in the United States could represent about a third of its capital expenditures over the next five years.The announced tax payment was roughly in line with expectations, said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross. The tax bill requires companies to pay a one-time tax on foreign-held earnings whether they intend to bring them back to the United States or not.Apple had set aside $36.3 billion in anticipation of tax payments on its foreign cash, meaning the payment would not represent a major impact on its cash flow this quarter.James Cordwell of Atlantic Equities said Apple's U.S. investment plan could make it easier for the company to give more cash to shareholders.""Being seen to just hand the cash back to shareholders could spark some political sensitivities,"" and the spending announcement could be part of Apple's efforts to manage this issue, Cordwell said.Apple also said it would boost its advanced manufacturing fund, used to provide capital and support to suppliers such as Finisar Corp (FNSR.O) and Corning Inc (GLW.N), from $1 billion to $5 billion. Apple said it planned to spend $55 billion with U.S.-based suppliers in 2018, up from $50 billion last year.AMAZON VS APPLEApple joins Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in scouting for a location for a new campus. Amazon finished taking applications from cities in October for its second headquarters.Amazon set off a scramble between cities across the nation to host the headquarters, and Apple's announcement stirred broad interest. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters on Wednesday that ""we're going to go compete and we're going to put our best foot forward"" to compete for an Apple campus. A Philadelphia Department of Commerce spokeswoman said the city would submit a proposal if Apple opened the process for bids.Apple has not said whether it had settled on a new campus location yet, and it did not make any commitments on the size of new spending or hiring specific to the campus. It did say it would initially house technical support for customers and would announce the location later this year.The facility would be in addition to its ""spaceship"" Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, California; a campus in Austin, Texas that houses customer service agents and some manufacturing; and an Elk Grove, California, unit with several thousand customer service agents and iPhones refurbishing technicians.Apple also has built its own data centers in North Carolina, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona and a recently announced project in Iowa, and leases data center space in other states.(Additional reporting by Sonam Rai, Pushkala Aripaka, Muvija M. and Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham, Peter Henderson, Marguerita Choy and Richard Chang)Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Shortly after the beginning, Wayne sold off his 10% stake and parted ways.The journey from there involves Apple’s first device, the Apple I, followed by the Apple II, “incalculable” losses on the Apple III, and the first mass-market consumer-priced computer in the form of the Macintosh.Then Jobs and Wozniak left, and several CEOs ran a growing Apple before Jobs returned in 1997. Ten years later, in January 2007, Jobs unveiled the iPhone and changed history. The rest of the ride starts at that moment.Today, Apple (AAPL) is one of the most recognizable companies in the world. Its market valuation reached $1 trillion in August 2018 — before the stock dropped considerably in the second half of 2018 — and millions of its devices are in the hands of users around the world. From the advent of the personal computer to the dark days following Steve Jobs’ ouster to the unprecedented success of the iPhone, Apple has been revolutionizing consumer technology for decades.

(NASDAQ: AMAT) fell as much as 10.1% in trading Friday after reporting fiscal second-quarter 2018 earnings and guidance that left investors unimpressed. Shares didn't recover much throughout the day and were down 9% at 12:20 p.m. EDT.Quarterly revenue was up 29% to $4.57 billion and net income jumped 37% to $1.13 billion, or $1.09 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, which pulls out on-time items, earnings were $1.22 per share. Interestingly, revenue easily surpassed the $4.45 billion analysts were expecting and non-GAAP earnings per share topped expectations of $1.13.Image source: Getty Images.What investors focused on today was weak guidance for smartphone products like chips and displays. Management said semiconductor sales are only expected to grow 7% in the fiscal third quarter, half of what Wall Street expected, and investors are concerned that weakness in display sales will curb growth. But keep in mind that display was just 13% of sales in the quarter.As if the stock dropping after an earnings beat wasn't bad enough, management's guidance for the fiscal third quarter of $4.33 billion to $4.53 billion in revenue and $1.13 to $1.21 per share in earnings were at the high-end of expectations. Analysts were expecting $4.45 billion in revenue and $1.14 per share in earnings next quarter.There may be lumpiness in some of Applied Materials's segments, but I don't see any reason for concern long term. The stock only trades for 11 times fiscal year 2018 estimates and both revenue and earnings are still on the rise as overall consumption of tech products grows. Long term, growth in tech devices is a wave investors will want to ride, even if this quarter seemed a bit disappointing.

This Silicon Valley giant is one of the top suppliers of equipment to the global semiconductor business, and with the rise in demand for high-end chips throughout the world, AMAT has seen its client activity pick up significantly.In its most recent quarter, Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, up 59% from the year-ago period. Total quarterly revenues came in at $4.2 billion, improving more than 28% year over year.It is not often that companies with AMAT’s size and legacy see such rapid expansion. And investors have certainly noticed this growth, sending the stock soaring more than 60% over the past year. Still, there appears to be plenty of room left for Applied to run higher.One catalyst for a continued surge could be the company’s improving outlook. Within the past 60 days, we have seen seven positive revisions for AMAT’s full-year earnings estimates, bringing our Zacks Consensus Estimate a whopping 31 cents higher over that timeframe. We now expect to see the company witness full-year earnings growth of 35%.Even with the stock’s recent surge, AMAT’s positive outlook makes its forward-looking guidance extremely attractive for value investors. What’s more, the stock is also trading at a discount to its most comparable peers.Here’s Applied’s Forward P/E trend compared to that of its peer group:AMAT’s peer group includes ASML Holding ASML, Lam Research LRCX, KLA-Tencor KLAC, and Advanced Energy Industries AEIS. Not all of these companies are direct competitors to AMAT, but they do function as suppliers to semiconductor manufacturers. Comparing AMAT to these stocks helps us show how investors tend to value this niche market.When we break it down like this, we can really see that AMAT is an interesting value option. However, we should note that the stock is only sporting a “C” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. In contrast to its attractive P/E, AMAT’s P/S of 3.9 is less appealing than the broader market. Applied might also raise eyebrows from a cash-flow perspective, as it is only generating about $3.69 in cash per share right now—about 40% less than its industry’s average.Still, the foundation of AMAT’s is only getting stronger right now, and the stock’s Forward P/E implies that investors are getting a great price for that strength.Want more market analysis from this author?

AAOI stock popped up on our radar when shares soared from sub-$10 in mid-2016 to more than $100 just 12 months later. However, that was the peak for Applied Opto stock as it then cratered more than $70 per share to $30, a fall of more than 70%.So surely, some are wondering if now is the time to pull the trigger and scoop up AAOI stock.About a month ago, management set a firm date for earnings. The quarterly results will hit the wires on February 21, assuming the company sticks to its current plan. However, unlike the previous few quarters, the announcement did not follow a downbeat pre-announcement, something investors had gotten used to. That’s got some investors optimistic that the results might not be bad.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 5 Cheap Dividend Stocks With Growing Payouts For the quarter, analysts expect earnings per share of 83 cents and revenue of $85.5 million. This would represent year-over-year sales growth of less than 1% and a 1-cent-per-share decline in earnings. Notably, three months ago, analysts were looking for 96 cents per share from the company. So clearly expectations are in decline. When looking at the chart though, that’s not much of a surprise.Applied Opto stock has suffered over the past few quarters as demand in China has tempered. Margin pressure from tougher competition hasn’t been helping either. Pressure on sales and profitability is never a good sign, especially for a company like this.Applied Opto stock is still in fiscal 2017 and currently trades at just seven times 2017 earnings. That’s a pretty low number considering forecasts calling for 48% sales growth and more than triple the earnings AAOI had in 2016.So what gives? Well, perhaps the most obvious problem is 2018. Analysts expect earnings per share to fall from $4.55 this year to just $3.44 next year. While it’s still much better than 2016’s earnings of $1.39 per share, it also marks a decline of more than 24%. In addition to the drop in earnings expectations, forecasts only call for a 1.6% gain in sales.In AAOI’s case, we have slight revenue growth and a big decline in earnings. That doesn’t bode well for margins either, as the bottom line is declining despite expectations for a stable top line. On top of that, we don’t know if analysts’ estimates are low enough.Currently, AAOI stock trades at 9.3 times 2018 earnings. On the plus side, this is still a pretty low valuation. But the business is volatile and as we’ve seen in the past, that puts the stock at a discount. For instance, look at Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). Shares trade at roughly 4 times earnings despite analysts calling for strong growth in 2018 and following an incredible 2017. In fact, that goes for stocks like Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) as well.The bottom line? When the business is volatile, the stocks come at a discount. In many cases, we see the opposite is true as well. Many blue-chip stocks may not have the strongest growth, but they tend to come with premium valuations simply because their businesses are dependable.AAOI stock is down more than 70% from its highs and just hit 52-week lows last week. Some investors might be considering overlooking its questionable reliability in lieu of its low valuation and possibly attractive stock chart. Below are two charts, the first a long-term weekly and the second a one-year chart. Click to Enlarge Click to EnlargeAs you can see in the long-term chart, the bounce near $29 could ultimately act as support for AAOI stock. As promising as this setup looks though, investors need something to happen first. On the short-term chart, we can see the “descending triangle” in AAOI stock. This is a bearish setup and there’s really no telling when the selling will exhaust.While we can’t see when it will happen, we can see when it has happened. When AAOI stock breaks out over the top of its descending triangle, investors who want to play this name can consider buying. These setups are attractive because the risk-reward profile tends to be so reasonable. We would look to play a strong rally in the name while using a stop-loss on AAOI if it re-enters the descending triangle. 7 Rock-Solid Stocks to Hold On for Dear Life One additional note: Remember that AAOI reports earnings on Wednesday after the close.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsArista Networks delivered non-GAAP earnings of $1.71 per share in fourth-quarter 2017, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 per share. The figure also surged 64.4% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues of $467.9 million soared 42.7% from the year-ago quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $464 million. Further, the figure came a head of management’s guidance of $450-$464 million. Product revenues (87% of total revenues) surged 40.9% to $407.2 million. Service revenues (13% of total revenues) rose 55.7% to $60.7 million.Arista is benefiting from strong demand for 100-gigabit routing and switching products, particularly from cloud titans. Top five customer verticals in the quarter were cloud titans, Tier 1 and 2 service providers, cloud specialty providers, high tech enterprises and financials.The company stated that visibility around cloud titans remains strong for the next one or two quarters. Management noted that FlexRoute license (almost 150 customers) has helped it enter additional layers of the spine for routing and data-center interconnect, where Cisco Systems Inc and Juniper Networks Inc. were dominant names.During the quarter, the company expanded cloud-grade routing with the launch of its latest Arista EOS (Extensible Operating System) and CloudVision software.Quarter DetailsInternational revenues were $153.8 million, or 33% of total revenues, up from 27% in the year-ago quarter.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company acquired more than 4,900 customers, with Microsoft accounting for 16% of the total revenues for 2017.During the quarter, the company launched Arista Any Cloud software platform, which helps in reducing operational costs as well as complexity for enterprises by simplifying integration and management of hybrid clouds across private cloud data centers and public cloud providers.Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) to 65.9%. Further, the figure surpassed the company’s guidance of 63-65%, primarily driven by strong revenues and favorable customer mix. Product gross margin contracted 100 bps, while service margin expanded 100 bps.Operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, were 29.7% as compared with 34.4% in the year-ago quarter. Research & development (R&D) and sales & marketing (S&M) expenses declined 40 bps and 360 bps, respectively.The lower R&D expenses reflect reduced prototype and NRE spending, offset by continued headcount growth.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded almost 380 bps on a year-over-year basis to 36.1%.Legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits were $9.1 million in the quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowCash & cash equivalents and marketable securities as of Dec 31, 2017, were $1.53 billion compared with $854.5 million in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $183.7 million.Inventory declined to $306.2 million in the quarter from $333.2 million in the previous quarter.Deferred revenue balance was $515.3 million, down from $565.1 million in the previous quarter.GuidanceFor first-quarter 2018, Arista projects revenues in the range of $450-$468 million. The company projects non-GAAP gross margin of 63-65% and operating margin of approximately 32%.Management anticipates R&D spending to increase in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, Arista expects costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately $8 million for the quarter.Note: The EPS data mentioned in the text of this section differs from the rest of report due to the difference in calculation or consideration of one-time items.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

A few of them even used machine guns.Yes, machine guns. Not the readily available, semi-automatic rifles that have figured so tragically in recent mass shootings, igniting a national furor over gun laws. We’re talking about actual machine guns, which are about as far from the local gun store inventory as you can get, and much more difficult to buy. A machine gun typically shoots about 600 to 800 rounds a minute, while the Bushmaster AR-15 will fire about 45 rounds a minute, depending on how fast you pull the trigger. Fully automatic firearms are often depicted in movies, but in real life they’re a rare commodity except to members of the military.Some of the hoops a buyer must navigate to get one mirror what some proponents of tougher gun laws would like for all firearms. But the red tape has also helped make machine guns the ultimate collector’s item, with some having doubled in value over the past 10 years.Frank Goepfert is one of the biggest machine gun merchants in America. From a 100-plus-acre ranch he shares with his wife, son and German shorthair puppy in rural Jasper, Missouri, he runs a small empire of automatic weapons. Inside a tornado-proof vault, dozens of automatic firearms worth millions of dollars hang on the walls. There are Tommy guns, M2 Brownings, Uzis, a Sterling submachine gun and AK-47 assault rifles, the most popular machine gun in the world.Goepfert, 47, who regularly sports a leather jacket and a black Stetson, says his company, Midwest Tactical Inc., sold as many as 500 machine guns in 2017, averaging thousands of dollars each. He’s made enough money to purchase two planes and even a tank.His best customer, a technology company executive, spent $1.6 million on guns last year, while an oil and farming tycoon dropped $1.2 million, he says. By Goepfert’s tally, he has 20 clients who each have spent more than $200,000 on his wares. He declined to identify them, citing privacy considerations. And while the government keeps a record of automatic weapons, it’s not public. That may make Goepfert one of the best sources of information outside the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives when it comes to who has a machine gun in America.There are “a fixed amount” of such weapons, says ATF Special Agent Joshua Jackson. “Demand has caused the value of these firearms to increase.”In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed an act effectively banning civilians from purchasing new machine guns. Suddenly, most of those already out there became a lot more valuable (Goepfert says there were 250,000 at the time). Today, the exact number left isn’t known, though one industry expert put it at 182,000.Some of Midwest Tactical’s best-selling models have climbed in value by tens of thousands of dollars since Goepfert and his wife Joy, 45, started the company. According to data collected by the Machine Gun Price Guide, which uses information from dealers, auctions and gun shows, the cost of a Tommy gun (the Thompson M1) went from about $9,000 in 2004 to almost $27,000 last July—a 200 percent increase. The Heckler & Koch MP5 soared 250 percent, from almost $12,000 in 2003 to $42,000. Meanwhile, the MAC10, technically a “machine pistol,” more than doubled in price from 2011 to 2017, to more than $8,000.Many machine guns held by civilians are war relics brought home by GIs, going back to World War II. Goepfert says he once heard of a wealthy widow who—hating her late husband’s collection—let the ATF destroy it. Such firearms need regular attention or they will disintegrate, and Goepfert counts on sellers who don’t want the hassle. The delicate nature of machine guns also helps increase their value. The more guns fall apart, the more valuable those that remain become.When Goepfert switches from purchaser to salesman, his job falls somewhere between gun dealer, money manager and antiquities expert.“We work with a lot of buyers that, you know—they’ll tell us what they’re wanting to collect or invest in and then we go out and try to actually locate a good quality item for them,” he says. “So we work with them and kind of coach them a lot of times.” In addition to making sure the desired firearm is in stock, Goepfert says will pull its price history so a buyer has an idea of what kind of return they will see.In the past, the machine gun industry saw upticks in sales when the stock market experienced a downturn. “I’ve actually had people pull out of the stock market or real estate when that was going on, and they’ll say, ‘I want to put my money in something different, something a little bit safer,’” he says. “They might not invest $1 million in machine guns, but part of their investment will probably go there.” One exception was when the price of oil tanked. Midwest Tactical experienced a slide in sales, he says, because many of his clients work in the energy sector.Goepfert didn’t set out to become the king of machine gun collectors. He just didn’t want to work for anyone else. “We really had no money—he couldn’t keep a job,” recalls Joy, who started dating Frank when they were teenagers sharing a high school locker. Eventually, he took up landscaping and built his own business, then tired of the physically demanding work. Looking around for something else, Frank turned to machine guns.At first, he just wanted to own one. So in 2005, he looked into how he could get his hands on a machine gun legally—specifically his preferred firearm, an AC556, referred to by aficionados as the “buzzsaw.” It wasn’t easy, but it was worth the trouble, Goepfert says. A few weeks after buying it, someone offered him $1,000 more than he had paid.At about the same time, he was pursuing another firearms-related hobby: building silencers, though he ultimately exited that market because it was too time-consuming. There was a residual benefit, though. “It kind of helped me develop a network,” he says. By 2008, when the financial crisis hit, Goepfert was cleaning out dealers who were closing up shop and developing relationships with older collectors looking to part with their guns. “We would have people call that they were hit by the recession, maybe they lost their job or business wasn’t as good as it had been, so they’d want to sell their machine guns” Goepfert says.Recognizing how much care the guns require, Goepfert says he rarely makes purchases that require repairs. Very old guns are often left untouched by his staff of six, since changing them in any way could decrease their value. Some are so delicate that the act of firing them could cause damage.Goepfert had carved out a profitable niche—one that would become much more lucrative when he started marketing his guns on the internet. His websites are now the first Google result for machine gun sales, and his business is a top 10 seller on Gun Broker, the nation’s largest online firearms auction marketplace. Midwest Tactical recently purchased SubGuns.com, a forum and classified-listing website, which Goepfert operates alongside MachineGunCentral.com. The web now generates 99 percent of Midwest Tactical’s sales, he says.The ATF defines a machine gun as “any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.” Actual machine guns rarely figure in criminal acts, in part because buying one is such a burdensome, expensive and paperwork-heavy process.The National Firearms Act of 1934 slapped a $200 transfer tax on them, the equivalent of $3,773 in 2018 dollars. In addition to machine guns, the act regulated silencers and shotguns with barrels less than 18 inches long. Then came the Gun Control Act of 1968, which further expanded thedefinition of a machine gun. About two decades later, the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act effectively banned newly manufactured machine guns from being purchased by civilians at all.Since then, machine guns that can be sold legally are referred to as transferrable, meaning they were previously registered with the National Firearm Registration and Transfer Record, according to the ATF. Machine guns that weren’t registered—but should have been—are illegal to possess.Buying an AR-15 is as easy as visiting your local gun dealer and getting a background check. Buying a firearm from its current owner is even easier. A machine gun, however, is far from an impulse buy: The paperwork can take months, with many hurdles along the way that can stop the process.Machine gun buyers have to go through a local, federally licensed dealer who must first take delivery, charging a fee of up to $200. Such dealers are required to fill out paperwork transferring the weapon to them and submit it to the ATF. “That paperwork is everything,” Joy Goepfert says. “That is the license for the gun. That gun really is not valuable without that paperwork.”Barring any mistakes, that initial process can take as long as a month. Once complete, Frank Goepfert says, the buyer has to make an appointment with local law enforcement and fill out a fingerprint card for submission to the ATF. Additionally, the buyer needs to fill out a certificate of compliance. After that, a buyer has to show up again at the local gun dealer, fill out further paperwork, pay the $200 transfer tax, and ship the whole file to the ATF. Upon receipt, the agency will begin a background check and examine the paperwork. This process can take six months.In some cases, these machine guns aren’t fired by their new owners—or even taken out of their cases. A few never even reach the buyer, staying in the dealer’s hands until the price appreciates enough to sell it. Machine guns serve purely as an investment tool for anyone willing to endure the requisite bureaucratic obstacles—an extreme version of requirements gun law advocates seek for more common types of firearms.Eventually—unless the statutes controlling machine guns change—legal sales will become increasingly rare as their numbers inexorably shrink over time. In the meantime, those still circulating will likely keep getting more valuable.(Michael R.

(NYSE:AZO) fell by as much as 10% on the earnings miss. However, for AutoZone stock investors, missing estimates may become the least of their problems. AZO’s debt burden and unpaid liabilities pose a danger to the stock.Even worse, management’s preference for stock buybacks could create issues for the company and its investors alike. Until the company’s balance sheet improves, investors should avoid AutoZone stock.The company reported earnings for the second quarter of 2018 of $8.47 per share. This missed consensus by 46 cents per share. Revenues of $2.41 billion beat estimates by $20 million and resulted in 5.2% growth from year-ago levels. Although earnings showed a 9.3% increase on a year-over-year basis, Wall Street did not take the news well, and the stock sold off in morning trading.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever The company’s problems remain unrelated to its industry. Auto parts sales serve as a profitable revenue source for investors. The industry’s recession-proof nature also keeps revenues reliable. Although Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has entered the market, a reluctance to wait on parts reduces the threat Amazon can pose.This serves AutoZone stock and its peers well. Moreover, the average age of cars has risen to 11.6 years. Since older cars more often need new parts, the aging of vehicles works in AZO’s favor. Still, since customers can also turn to peers such as Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC), and O’Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY), store coverage remains essential. The company added 216 stores over the last year to bring its latest store count to 6,088. Hence, coverage continues improving.AutoZone stock also remains cheap. The equity trades at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 15. This is lower than its three main competitors. Also, of its direct peers, only GPC showed a higher level of sales growth in the previous quarter.Unfortunately for AutoZone stock investors, the equity appears to hold a low valuation for a reason. As I mentioned after the previous quarterly earnings report, the current ratio remains a concern. Once again, the company’s current liabilities exceed the value of its current assets. The gap between current assets and liabilities narrowed from the last quarter. It stands at about $1.2 billion now. The book value also remains negative, coming in at -$1.565 billion. And as in the last quarter, the debt and accounts payable liabilities almost match the value of the company’s total assets.Decisions at the top are the likely reason for the negative book value. AutoZone’s leaders appear to prioritize stock buybacks over the company’s financial stability. Shares outstanding fell to 27.35 million, down from 27.49 million. The buybacks seem to have had little long-term impact. With the fall in the stock price after the earnings report, the stock trades only modestly higher than it did after the last earnings report.Moreover, the negative book value may force a resale of some of that stuck at much lower prices if events force the company to shore up its balance sheet.

In fact, Bank of America's stock price has nearly tripled over that time.However, there's good reason for the tremendous outperformance. Bank of America is a much-improved institution, and there are several growth catalysts that could propel the bank's profits even higher over the coming years. Here's a rundown of its various improvements and growth catalysts to determine if it's still worth buying now.Image source: Bank of America.I already said that Bank of America is an ""improved institution"" over the past couple of years, so for a little more color, here's what I mean by that.Bank of America has taken steps to greatly improve its efficiency and profitability. For example, it has closed over 250 branches and has invested considerable resources in developing its online and mobile platforms, which are far more cost-effective than in-person banking transactions. Just to name one statistic, roughly one out of every four of Bank of America's deposit transactions now happen through its mobile app -- an increase of more than 50% in the past two years.In addition, the bank has done a good job of reducing its expenses. In fact, despite its $193 billion deposit growth and $33 billion loan growth over the past couple of years, noninterest expenses have actually declined by 4.4%.The result is greatly improved efficiency and profitability. The bank's efficiency ratio has dropped by more than 8 percentage points (lower is better), and while they aren't quite where they need to be just yet, return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) are much closer to the 1% and 10% industry benchmarks than they used to be.MetricQ4 2015Q4 2017Efficiency ratio70.2%62%ROA0.61%0.93%ROE5.1%7.9%Data source: Bank of America earnings reports. 2017 data excludes the one-time impact of tax reform.Even though Bank of America has made tremendous progress over the past couple of years, there's still a lot of room for improvement in areas such as increasing the usage of mobile services and other technologies, continuing to grow its Merrill Edge brokerage business, and more.In addition, there are a few industrywide catalysts that could be a major boost to Bank of America's bottom line.For starters, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates several more times over the next couple of years, which should lead to increased margins. In fact, over the past year, the bank's net interest yield expanded by 16 basis points thanks to a few Fed rate hikes. Bank of America estimates that a 100-basis-point (1 percentage point) parallel shift in the yield curve would translate to $3.3 billion in additional net interest income over a 12-month period.Tax reform is another big potential catalyst. Bank of America has historically operated at an effective tax rate in the 30% ballpark. So, the new 21% corporate tax rate could translate to billions in additional profit.Bank of America is one of the largest stock positions in my own portfolio, and I have no plans to sell my shares anytime soon. If I didn't already own the bank, however, I would still feel comfortable adding more of it at the current share price.I feel that the higher price is more than justified given the bank's improved profitability, asset quality, and efficiency, and if the catalysts I mentioned here translate into larger profits, the current valuation could actually seem rather cheap.

Few financial institutions were more emblematic of all that was wrong with banking than one of the biggest, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC).In the half-decade following America's slow climb out of the depths of the crisis, no other American bank would pay more in fines, lawsuit settlements, or court penalties than Bank of America, which has paid more than $90 billion in damages and fines over the past decade. How bad of a bad actor was BofA? It has been subject to three of the five biggest separate banking fines in history, and all in the past decade.It may be a stretch to expect BofA alone to make you a millionaire. But it can help you get there. Image source: Getty Images.But today, Bank of America has made a remarkable comeback. The fines and legal implications have been dealt with. Its balance sheet is much stronger and its asset quality has improved. Furthermore, its operations are improved, as its steadily falling efficiency ratio demonstrates. But is it the kind of stock that can make investors rich?I'll say this right off the bat: I don't expect Bank of America to be the kind of stock that can turn $10,000 into $1 million over the next 20 years. But I do see it as a great business selling for a reasonable price, that also has a lot of things in its favor. Bank of America alone may not be a millionaire-maker stock, but it's still deserving of a place in a diversified portfolio.While it may not be priced at the dirt-cheap valuations it has sold for in the past, Bank of America stock still represents a solid value:BAC PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts.This is particularly true when we consider the historical context. When BofA shares sold for less than book value, the bank was still dealing with significant uncertainty surrounding its legal risks. There were still ongoing lawsuits from multiple states related to its mortgage-related sins, and its balance sheet was also a bit of a mess.Fast-forward to today, and the improvements under CEO Brian Moynihan have resulted in a more stable and more profitable business. Yet even as investors have steadily shown a willingness to pay a higher premium -- best demonstrated by the steady increase in its price-to-book value -- Bank of America is still cheaper than other big-bank peers:BAC PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts.To some extent, BofA should trade for a lower book value multiple. After all, it has produced lower returns than all of its better-valued peers for years now:BAC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts.But that argument alone ignores how much BofA has improved its returns:BAC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts.Getting back to 10% and 1% returns on equity and assets, respectively -- two key benchmarks for banking returns -- is a major accomplishment. Furthermore, I think investors can expect its returns to continue getting better. BofA is likely to continue to lower expenses as it invests in more online banking and closes banking centers, helping improve returns.But more importantly, BofA has a huge mix of noninterest-bearing deposits -- over $400 billion at last count -- which should allow it to benefit in a bigger way from rising interest rates. Management says 100 basis points in rising interest rates -- we've already seen 75 BPS this year -- would add nearly $3 billion in extra net interest income.If you're lucky enough to invest in a single stock that eventually makes you a millionaire, that's awesome. But it's unlikely and I wouldn't count on it happening. But what you can count on helping you reach millionaire status is regularly investing a portion of your income into high-quality companies at reasonable prices, and holding for the long term.Today, Bank of America meets the criteria as high-quality and good price. It sells for a reasonable valuation, and under Brian Moynihan it has become a very good business with solid prospects that's built to survive the inevitable ups and downs of the banking and economic cycles.I'll make no promises that a BofA investment will make you rich, or that it will even be profitable in three or five years. But I fully expect making a long-term investment in the bank across multiple credit cycles will pay off. As a shareholder, I'm personally counting on it.

Few financial institutions were more emblematic of all that was wrong with banking than one of the biggest, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC).In the half-decade following America's slow climb out of the depths of the crisis, no other American bank would pay more in fines, lawsuit settlements, or court penalties than Bank of America, which has paid more than $90 billion in damages and fines over the past decade. How bad of a bad actor was BofA? It has been subject to three of the five biggest separate banking fines in history, and all in the past decade.It may be a stretch to expect BofA alone to make you a millionaire. But it can help you get there. Image source: Getty Images.But today, Bank of America has made a remarkable comeback. The fines and legal implications have been dealt with. Its balance sheet is much stronger and its asset quality has improved. Furthermore, its operations are improved, as its steadily falling efficiency ratio demonstrates. But is it the kind of stock that can make investors rich?I'll say this right off the bat: I don't expect Bank of America to be the kind of stock that can turn $10,000 into $1 million over the next 20 years. But I do see it as a great business selling for a reasonable price, that also has a lot of things in its favor. Bank of America alone may not be a millionaire-maker stock, but it's still deserving of a place in a diversified portfolio.While it may not be priced at the dirt-cheap valuations it has sold for in the past, Bank of America stock still represents a solid value:BAC PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts.This is particularly true when we consider the historical context. When BofA shares sold for less than book value, the bank was still dealing with significant uncertainty surrounding its legal risks. There were still ongoing lawsuits from multiple states related to its mortgage-related sins, and its balance sheet was also a bit of a mess.Fast-forward to today, and the improvements under CEO Brian Moynihan have resulted in a more stable and more profitable business. Yet even as investors have steadily shown a willingness to pay a higher premium -- best demonstrated by the steady increase in its price-to-book value -- Bank of America is still cheaper than other big-bank peers:BAC PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts.To some extent, BofA should trade for a lower book value multiple. After all, it has produced lower returns than all of its better-valued peers for years now:BAC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts.But that argument alone ignores how much BofA has improved its returns:BAC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts.Getting back to 10% and 1% returns on equity and assets, respectively -- two key benchmarks for banking returns -- is a major accomplishment. Furthermore, I think investors can expect its returns to continue getting better. BofA is likely to continue to lower expenses as it invests in more online banking and closes banking centers, helping improve returns.But more importantly, BofA has a huge mix of noninterest-bearing deposits -- over $400 billion at last count -- which should allow it to benefit in a bigger way from rising interest rates. Management says 100 basis points in rising interest rates -- we've already seen 75 BPS this year -- would add nearly $3 billion in extra net interest income.If you're lucky enough to invest in a single stock that eventually makes you a millionaire, that's awesome. But it's unlikely and I wouldn't count on it happening. But what you can count on helping you reach millionaire status is regularly investing a portion of your income into high-quality companies at reasonable prices, and holding for the long term.Today, Bank of America meets the criteria as high-quality and good price. It sells for a reasonable valuation, and under Brian Moynihan it has become a very good business with solid prospects that's built to survive the inevitable ups and downs of the banking and economic cycles.I'll make no promises that a BofA investment will make you rich, or that it will even be profitable in three or five years. But I fully expect making a long-term investment in the bank across multiple credit cycles will pay off. As a shareholder, I'm personally counting on it.

But how are you supposed to pick a winner? We make it easier with exhaustive comparison of America’s three largest banking institutions. Read on as you make the Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo decision.Bank of America: Best VersatilityDespite its vast size and national presence, Bank of America, does not feature the nation’s highest-earning interest rates on its accounts. Unfortunately, Bank of America consistently fails to deliver robust annual savings growth for its account holders. But if you’re seeking additional benefits ahead of building your current savings, BoA could be a very viable choice. Its Rewards Savings Account offers benefits based on your spending patterns. Bank of America also offers a wide range of products tailored to its customers, including multiple savings accounts and more than 10 certificates of deposit (CDs). Whether you’re an avid spender or a frugal saver, you’ll probably find that Bank of American has what you’re after.Chase Bank: Best for Waiving FeesChase is the largest bank in the U.S., across every metric. But for all its size, its interest rates are curiously unimpressive. Even so, like Bank of America, Chase Bank offers several distinct banking options, which enables it to provide services to customers at every income level. Its two basic savings accounts are called the Chase Savings and Chase Premier Savings accounts, the latter of which offers slightly better rates and benefits and is catered toward customers with higher balances. The Chase Savings account is the more standard of the two, without any extra perks. It also earns at the lowest APY, regardless of your account balance. There are several options for waiving the attached fees that Chase employs, but most of them hinge on maintaining certain account minimums. If you’re starting out unsteady, Chase may not be for you.Wells Fargo: Best Range of OptionsWells Fargo, the third-largest bank in America, has more than 6,000 physical branches and 13,000 ATMs in 40 states. With user experience at the top of its perks, Wells Fargo also has a highly rated app and easy-to-use online portal that makes banking on the go a breeze. Wells Fargo is also at the top of its game in terms of options. It has a vast list of inventory: you can choose from two savings accounts, three CD types, five checking accounts and a group of different IRAs.For those looking to consolidate their assets into one account, Wells Fargo has you covered there, too. Finding the right account for your particular financial situation is key to getting the most out of Wells Fargo.  But much like BoA and Chase, unfortunately, Wells Fargo accounts don’t have particularly good interest rates. For instance, Wells Fargo’s basic Way2Save Savings account only earns at a 0.01% APY.  This is a primary downfall of big banks like these three; the cost of maintaining thousands of physical locations means fees are higher. Convenience comes with a cost.But when examining the Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo match-up, it’s important to take a deeper dive into how the accounts stack up.Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo: Bank AccountsEach of the banks offers a unique array of accounts to choose from. We’ve organized it into a definitive list, so you can see precisely what one bank has and another lacks as you make the Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo Decision.Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo: Bank Account Offers Type of Account Bank of America Chase  Wells Fargo Checking – Personal “Core” Checking Account  – Interest Checking Account  – Student Banking  – Business Checking Account – Total Checking  – Premier Plus Checking  – Premier Platinum Checking  – Student Checking – Everyday Checking  – Preferred Checking  – Portfolio by Wells Fargo  – Teen Checking  – Opportunity Checking  Savings – Rewards Savings Account – Savings  – Premier Savings – Way2Save Savings  – Platinum Savings  CDs – Featured CD Account  – Standard Term CD Account – Standard CD – Wells Fargo CD Account MMAs – Money Market IRA – Not offered – Various term-length CD accounts  – Wells Fargo Business Platinum Savings Account IRAs – Savings IRAs  – Investment IRAs – Not offered – Available to help with retirement savingsAll three banks offer a healthy list of bank accounts complete with savings, checking and CD accounts. You can start saving for retirement with a Wells Fargo or Bank of America IRA, something that Chase alone lacks. All offer teen and student checking accounts. While Bank of America does make fee allowances for students, it does not have specific accounts for younger owners.Wells Fargo does offer more variety with its account options than Bank of America. There is no real winner, however, when it comes to account perks. Both big banks more or less match each other in ATM offerings, branch presence and online/mobile access.But it’s important to examine how those fees could affect your account balance when making the Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo comparison. Bank of America vs. Wells Fargo vs. Chase: FeesBank of America, Chase and Wells Fargo accounts all charge a monthly fee, with the exact amounts owed reliant on the specific account and the balance therein. On average, though, Wells Fargo’s monthly fees range anywhere from $5 to $30. Bank of America monthly fees range from $4.95 to $25. Chase Premier Savings account charges a $25 monthly fee. You can also often waive a monthly service fee by meeting certain requirements like a minimum account balance or setting up direct deposits. On average, despite the fact that all three banks charging monthly maintenance fees, Wells Fargo’s tend to be lower than those of the other two. It also provides more opportunities to have the fees waived.Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo: RatesNeither Bank of America nor Chase nor Wells Fargo offers very special interest rates. Wells Fargo’s and Chase’s simple savings accounts earn bare minimum interest at 0.01%. Bank of America’s account comes in a tiny bit higher at 0.03%. All three banks will provide opportunities to boost your rate, should you opt for premium banking packages.When it comes to CD rates, Wells Fargo outperforms Bank of America just slightly, but Bank of America takes the cake with a 1% APY. Bank of America, Chase and Wells Fargo all offer fairly low interest rates, due to the costs required to operate thousands of branch locations. But despite their low fees, each of them offer a wealth of options to get around them—if you’re attentive and seek them out.Bottom LineThe Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo decision is a tough one, because all offer their customers a wide array of benefits. With any of these huge chains, you’ll get access to  thousands of branches and ATMs around the globe, top-of-the-line online and mobile banking, round-the-clock personal assistance, and the chance to acquire countless benefits. However, if you’re expecting high-earning interest rates, neither of the big three will be the bank for you.Due to their budget being drained by supporting brick-and-mortar establishments, the rates of these big banks very rarely surpass 1%. Online banks like Ally and Synchrony and credit unions live Navy Federal don’t pose the same problem. They have the capacity to provide more robust interest rates to their account holders, as they do not have the overhead costs of a big bank. So, while all three banks will likely provide what you need from a bank at a baseline level, the choice comes down to what particular service you believe to be the most important.But don’t go it alone when making the Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo decision. If you’re considering switching banks, it’s best not to leave any room for guesswork. Find a financial advisor in your area who perfectly fits your financial needs with SmartAsset’s financial advisor matching calculator.Tips for Finding the Right BankBefore you pick a bank, make sure you know your current financial situation inside and out. Are you a good fit for a free checking account? Do you have a firm enough financial fallback to begin contributing to a high-interest savings account? Consider these factors and go from there.Looking for more options? Don’t forget credit unions. Credit unions like Western Union and Navy Federal are known for providing high rates than are big chains like Chase Bank or Citibank. National banks must shoulder the cost of operating physical storefronts nationwide—credit unions usually do not.Photo credits: ©iStock.com/Slphotography, ©iStock.com/shironosov, ©iStock.com/alexialexThe post Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo: Which of the Big 3 Is Right for You? appeared first on SmartAsset Blog.U.S. Bank vs. Bank of America: Which Is Better for You?The Best Places to Build an Emergency FundU.S. Bank vs. Wells Fargo: Which Is Better for You?Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

On average, despite the fact that all three banks charging monthly maintenance fees, Wells Fargo’s tend to be lower than those of the other two. It also provides more opportunities to have the fees waived.Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo: RatesNeither Bank of America nor Chase nor Wells Fargo offers very special interest rates. Wells Fargo’s and Chase’s simple savings accounts earn bare minimum interest at 0.01%. Bank of America’s account comes in a tiny bit higher at 0.03%. All three banks will provide opportunities to boost your rate, should you opt for premium banking packages.When it comes to CD rates, Wells Fargo outperforms Bank of America just slightly, but Bank of America takes the cake with a 1% APY. Bank of America, Chase and Wells Fargo all offer fairly low interest rates, due to the costs required to operate thousands of branch locations. But despite their low fees, each of them offer a wealth of options to get around them—if you’re attentive and seek them out.Bottom LineThe Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo decision is a tough one, because all offer their customers a wide array of benefits. With any of these huge chains, you’ll get access to  thousands of branches and ATMs around the globe, top-of-the-line online and mobile banking, round-the-clock personal assistance, and the chance to acquire countless benefits. However, if you’re expecting high-earning interest rates, neither of the big three will be the bank for you.Due to their budget being drained by supporting brick-and-mortar establishments, the rates of these big banks very rarely surpass 1%. Online banks like Ally and Synchrony and credit unions live Navy Federal don’t pose the same problem. They have the capacity to provide more robust interest rates to their account holders, as they do not have the overhead costs of a big bank. So, while all three banks will likely provide what you need from a bank at a baseline level, the choice comes down to what particular service you believe to be the most important.But don’t go it alone when making the Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo decision. If you’re considering switching banks, it’s best not to leave any room for guesswork. Find a financial advisor in your area who perfectly fits your financial needs with SmartAsset’s financial advisor matching calculator.Tips for Finding the Right BankBefore you pick a bank, make sure you know your current financial situation inside and out. Are you a good fit for a free checking account? Do you have a firm enough financial fallback to begin contributing to a high-interest savings account? Consider these factors and go from there.Looking for more options? Don’t forget credit unions. Credit unions like Western Union and Navy Federal are known for providing high rates than are big chains like Chase Bank or Citibank. National banks must shoulder the cost of operating physical storefronts nationwide—credit unions usually do not.Photo credits: ©iStock.com/Slphotography, ©iStock.com/shironosov, ©iStock.com/alexialexThe post Bank of America vs. Chase vs. Wells Fargo: Which of the Big 3 Is Right for You? appeared first on SmartAsset Blog.U.S. Bank vs. Bank of America: Which Is Better for You?The Best Places to Build an Emergency FundU.S. Bank vs. Wells Fargo: Which Is Better for You?Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

These buildings are technically referred to as “brick-and-mortar” branches, and they provide face-to-face service for customers of a bank. Branches customarily feature mortgage officers, financial advisors and other professionals as well, something that modern-day online banking currently cannot deliver. Read on to learn more about bank branches and if you should specifically join a bank that operates them.What Is a Bank Branch?If you’ve opened a bank account at some point during your life, you’ve probably set foot in a bank branch. A bank branch typically consists of a collection of tellers who can aid you in withdrawing money, depositing checks and cash and more. Many Americans prefer the in-person service a bank branch can offer, as it can be frustrating to deal with phone- and email-based customer service representatives. Branches can also be especially helpful if you’re applying for a loan, opening an investment portfolio or making any number of other important financial decisions.Bank branches began receiving the brick-and-mortar title, because that’s what they were quite literally made of. While this terminology only became necessary due to the rise of web-based banks, branches still exist all over the country. However, according to the Wall Street Journal, there has been a sharp nationwide rise in the number of branches being closed by banks. In fact, the report highlights that banks such as Capital One and SunTrust shut down 32% and 22% of their branches, respectively, from mid-2012 to mid-2017.In its most basic form, banking has been around for thousands of years, with historians crediting the Mesopotamians, Sumerians, Babylonians and other ancient cultures with this financial advancement. Branches, or institutions similar to them, didn’t begin appearing until the Roman Empire’s reign, though. From then on, bank branches popped up around the world, most notably in Italy, England and the U.S.Benefits of a Bank BranchA bank branch, or rather a widespread network of them, offers benefits to both customers and the bank itself. Not only does this allow customers to stop somewhere to have their needs met, but it also raises awareness for the bank’s brand and, in the end, makes it money. If you visit a branch, there are plenty of features to take advantage of.Perhaps the most basic interaction you’ll have at a bank branch is either the withdrawal or deposit of money. Branches will usually have a small table when you walk in where you can grab withdrawal slips, deposit slips and other paperwork necessary to complete a transaction. Although this may seem like an inconvenient alternative to the simplicity of an ATM, these machines tend to have withdrawal limits, whereas tellers do not.If you have a ton of coins and aren’t sure what to do with them, bank branches will almost always house some sort of coin counting machine. Once you know how much your coins are worth, bring the receipt to a teller to get cash for their value. Check with your bank to see if they offer this service.Banks have many protections in place to ensure that their money is not stolen. So it should come as no surprise that banks often have safety deposit boxes available for customers. These are strictly accessible through bank branches, although you’ll likely need to pay an annual fee for them.Branchless Alternatives to Brick-and-Mortar BanksWith the dawn of the age of the internet, online banks have become increasingly popular. Some companies have even taken this idea a step further by establishing banks based entirely within the confines of a mobile app. Common names in this growing market are Ally Bank, Simple Bank, Chime Bank and Bank of Internet USA.If you’re skeptical about banking with a company that has no brick-and-mortar locations, you’re not alone. These banks, however, have come up with some enticing ways to attract new customers. For example, the four banks listed above come with nonexistent or extremely low fee schedules and minimum opening deposits. But perhaps even better than these perks are the superior interest rates you’ll find with them.Nothing in finance comes without its downsides, though. One of the most prominent issues with online/mobile banks is that they often lack widespread account choice. This is because internet banks mostly stick to checking and savings accounts, while occasionally dabbling in money market accounts (MMAs). That means you typically won’t be able to get a certificate of deposit (CD) or an individual retirement account (IRA).Should You Join a Bank With Branches or Not?Are you deciding on whether to join a branchless or a brick-and-mortar bank? Instead of asking if you truly need access to in-person branches, ask if you’d prefer to have the choice to visit a branch, if necessary. Just know that by answering yes, you may be sacrificing the chance for better fee structures and interest rates with an online banking option. On the other hand, it seems most Americans are in favor of having branch locations available, leaving you in the majority.Tips for Navigating the Banking IndustryResearch is the key to success in finance, and banking is no different. If you’re in search of a new bank, be sure to include as many choices in your comparisons as possible. Even though something like an online-only bank might seem too far-fetched, it could be well worth looking into.Although typically associated with investments, financial advisors often have a wide range of knowledge that sometimes even spans into banking. So if you’re interested in joining a new bank, it might be worthwhile to consult an advisor.

Moreover, BDX has generated US$2.69b in operating cash flow in the last twelve months, leading to an operating cash to total debt ratio of 12.1%, indicating that BDX’s current level of operating cash is not high enough to cover debt. This ratio can also be interpreted as a measure of efficiency as an alternative to return on assets. In BDX’s case, it is able to generate 0.12x cash from its debt capital.At the current liabilities level of US$6.11b liabilities, it appears that the company has been able to meet these commitments with a current assets level of US$7.53b, leading to a 1.23x current account ratio. Usually, for Medical Equipment companies, this is a suitable ratio since there’s sufficient cash cushion without leaving too much capital idle or in low-earning investments.Considering Becton Dickinson’s total debt outweighs its equity, the company is deemed highly levered. This is not unusual for large-caps since debt tends to be less expensive than equity because interest payments are tax deductible. Accordingly, large companies often have an advantage over small-caps through lower cost of capital due to cheaper financing. We can assess the sustainability of BDX’s debt levels to the test by looking at how well interest payments are covered by earnings. A company generating earnings after interest and tax at least three times its net interest payments is considered financially sound. In BDX’s case, the ratio of 4.43x suggests that interest is well-covered. Large-cap investments like BDX are often believed to be a safe investment due to their ability to pump out ample earnings multiple times its interest payments.At its current level of cash flow coverage, BDX has room for improvement to better cushion for events which may require debt repayment. Though, the company exhibits an ability to meet its near-term obligations, which isn’t a big surprise for a large-cap. Keep in mind I haven’t considered other factors such as how BDX has been performing in the past.

Now, two major companies have scuttled such practices under a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity probe into whether the tests were discriminatory. Best Buy and CVS Caremark Corporation agreed to stop their practice of using personality tests as part of the job application process in separate conciliation agreements with the EEOC, the agency said Wednesday. The details of the agreements are confidential. The agency said the concerns about the policies were raised by a former EEOC commissioner. Neither company admitted liability. The use of personality tests ballooned over the last decade, as companies tried to find efficient ways to hire workers by using algorithms to predict how a worker will perform. A 2014 study by Human Resources group CEB found that 62 percent of the employers surveyed said they required applicants to take a personality test. Another survey that year found dozens of major U.S. companies in the energy and financial sectors were employing personality tests. The tests came under increasing scrutiny for their potential to weed out people with mental illness or certain racial groups. CVS had previously agreed, for example, to remove certain mental-health-related questions from its questionnaire after a probe from the Rhode Island Human Rights Commission. In recent years, the EEOC launched investigations in personality tests on the grounds of discrimination and has guidelines for these job applicant assessments. Some companies on their own have decided to eliminate or reduce parts of the assessment tests, including Whole Foods Market Inc. Target Corp. reached an agreement with the EEOC in 2015 in which the retail giant agreed to pay $2.8 million to resolve claims that its employment assessments discriminated against candidates based on race and sex. The company ended the practice in question before reaching litigation with the commission. In court, the EEOC has won cases over employment assessment tests, including against Ford Motor Company, Dial Corp. and DaimlerChrysler Corp. These cases centered around tests that the commission found discriminated against prospective hires on the basis of race, sex and disability, respectively. In the CVS investigation, the EEOC said the Rhode Island-based company's use of personality tests between 2002 and 2010 adversely affected applicants based on race and national origin. CVS stopped using the assessments after receiving the discrimination charge. The company declined to comment on the resolution with the EEOC. Following the agency’s probe, CVS agreed to implement “best practices,” which include modifying its hiring process, employing staff to recruit and monitor the hiring of minorities and developing a comprehensive training curriculum for managers. The company said it will also regularly conduct evaluations of its hiring practices and provide reports to the EEOC for several years. ""CVS has shown model cooperativeness in this conciliation process,"" said Jamie Williamson, director of the EEOC's Philadelphia District, of which Cleveland is a part. ""It's a great sign when such a major employer of national scope works with the EEOC to straighten out a situation that was discriminatory, even if it was never intended to be."" The case was similar for Best Buy. The agency said that Best Buy's tests between 2003 and 2010 harmed applicants based on race and national origin. The Minnesota-based electronics company agreed to stop end the assessment practices. The company agreed to comprehensive in-house training modules for hiring managers and will form regional diversity and inclusion committees. It will also evaluate its practices and submit regular reports to the EEOC. A Best Buy representative wasn't reached for comment. ""So-called 'personality tests' are unacceptable if they have the effect of screening out people because of their race or national origin,” Cheryl Mabry, director of the EEOC's Cleveland field office, said. “We appreciate Best Buy cooperating with the EEOC to correct this situation.""Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Management invests at least $1 million of their own money. Morningstar risk rating is below the High level. Returns are above the fund’s benchmark during the manager’s tenure.We further screened out the funds that are closed to new investors and selected just one fund from seven diverse categories.So here are the seven best funds narrowed from Morningstar’s list:Expenses: 0.64%, or $64 annually per every $10,000 investedMinimum Initial Investment: $250American Funds had the highest number of funds on Morningstar’s list, but their Growth Fund of America (MUTF:AGTHX) is the winner in the large growth category.AGTHX gets the nod from Morningstar because of its combination of low expenses, returns in relation to risk, and its depth of management experience.Although it is not an aggressive growth fund, AGTHX consistently produces above-average returns by holding solid large-caps like top holdings Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO).Note: Be sure to look for no-load versions of AGTHX, which can get the same or better results without the added charges.Source: ShutterstockExpenses: 0.75%Minimum Initial Investment: $250Investors looking for one of the best global stock funds or an outstanding core holding will like what they see in American Funds New Perspective (MUTF:ANWPX).ANWPX can be considered a go-anywhere fund, which is to say that its management team can go anywhere in the world to find the best stocks to hold. This flexibility has enabled ANWPX to put up above-average returns, especially in the long-term.The regional exposure is relatively balanced with approximately 50% in U.S. stocks and the other 50% in Europe and Asia. Most of the holdings are quality large-caps like AMZN, Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM), and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB).Expenses: 0.52%Minimum Initial Investment: $2,500Large-cap value fund, Dodge & Cox Stock (MUTF:DODGX), gets high marks for consistently strong returns, low expenses and experienced management.The portfolio focuses on high-quality, large-cap value stocks like Charles Schwab Corp (NYSE:SCHW), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC).The fund’s financial sector leanings should see it continue to do well in the current, rising interest rate environment and the top-notch management team looks to deliver in the long run as well.Source: ShutterstockExpenses: 0.45%Minimum Initial Investment: $2,500For bonds, one of the best mutual funds to buy is Fidelity Total Bond (MUTF:FTBFX).FTBFX makes the best of the best funds list by keeping expenses low and following what may be considered an enhanced index strategy. In different words, the management for FTBFX will use a benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Universal Bond Index, as a guide but it will not passively track it.What shareholders of FTBFX get, then, is a good combination of passive and active management that can potentially produce returns greater than that of the benchmark index.Editor’s Note: Decades of documentation show that a small group of Fidelity funds — when combined properly — drastically reduce risk while outperforming the average Fidelity investor by a whopping 201%. Fidelity won’t tell you what funds to buy and sell. Investment expert Jim Lowell will.

The company achieved record growth in 2017, increasing revenues by 300 percent while raising $8 million in Series A funding. In 2018, Solovis was named one of the top 50 startups by LinkedIn.In this installment of GOBankingRates’ “Best in Business” series, which sets out to discover what makes the people behind top innovative companies tick, Smith revealed what it’s like to spend your personal savings on a new company, how to build a workplace culture — and ways that you can find (or build) your own dream job.I left Investure and moved to Birmingham, Ala., because my wife was doing her medical residency there. At that time, I began consulting for endowments, foundations and family offices up and down the East Coast, and quickly realized all of these organizations were dealing with very similar problems to those we had at my previous investment firm. No technology vendor had focused on solving the underlying needs of this particular market — that of an institutional quality portfolio management system for asset allocators. I realized then what a huge opportunity this could be, and I started exploring options to make it happen.My research turned up no baseline technology to jump-start the effort, so I knew it would have to be built from the ground up. That’s when I contacted Caleb Doise, a brilliant technology architect and my former colleague at Investure, to gauge his interest in starting a company to solve the portfolio management needs of the institutional investor. He was in, and Solovis was born.Other than spending down my personal savings, I was very confident we had a niche space that we could, at the very least, create useful technology for. I don’t think Caleb or I ever had the vision of raising significant outside capital or having many of the prestigious clients we’ve been fortunate to work with. The common saying, “this has surpassed our wildest dreams,” would be an understatement!Related: Doing Something That Scares You Could Help You Build Your WealthHow willing people are to help. I was shocked at how many friends, former colleagues and firms had a real interest in not only becoming initial users of our software platform, but also in helping to fund and grow the company — and in some cases even come work with us. There are also a lot of great organizations willing to support technology innovation. Microsoft effectively gave us two years of free hosting and development resources. It was unbelievable.I always had a saying: “We have to be bigger than we are.” We weren’t going to walk into the most sophisticated asset managers in the world and convince them to work with and spend real dollars with a pure startup company with no security, no office and too much key man risk. There were early give and takes, but we always were ahead of where other “startups” were in terms of professionalism and growth. And now we have the infrastructure and the credibility of a blue chip client base, so we’ve been able to evolve from that early-stage startup into a growth company with a proven track record.Read More: Brilliant Startups That Wouldn’t Exist Without TeslaDon’t hire people who don’t fit your culture. Pure and simple. Also, your gut is usually right and even if someone is providing some degree of value, you can’t have naysayers and doubters at any level of the organization. This doesn’t mean you don’t have disagreements, but people who create conflict for the sake of personal gain are bad apples.Our early clients, early investors and early colleagues are all still with us. They’ve been steady supporters of our vision and growth during the best of times and during some darker times.Surround yourself with people that believe in your vision and will work tirelessly to make it a reality. Don’t do it to get rich, because then you become so much more focused on your equity and your compensation. If you do that early on, you will almost certainly create misalignment along the way.See: 30 Cities Where Small Businesses Are ThrivingI don’t define success for Solovis or even personally as some large overarching neon light that says “success.” Success to me is constantly pushing our boundaries and setting new goals each day. In general, though, the only “success” that really matters to me and the company is client success — have we created happy, reference-able clients who are evangelizing for Solovis.For me personally, success is loving coming in every day and driving the company to be better. We have a lot of people who love going to work every day and have made friendships for life with colleagues and clients. I firmly believe you create value by making all your stakeholders happy — not just management, not just shareholders, not just clients.

In the US, that includes AT&T and T-Mobile, but not Verizon and Sprint, which use the CDMA standard.The OnePlus 6T could cost $550, $20 more than the current OnePlus 6 that costs $530. But the price isn't finalized, according to CNET.While OnePlus phones are popular among their fans, chances are that someone wouldn't know what a ""OnePlus"" is if you stopped and asked them on the street.Part of the reason why you might never see a OnePlus phone on the street in the US is because they've never been available at carrier stores. Indeed, most Americans still buy their smartphones from their carriers, and a smartphone's popularity is often dictated by it's availability at carrier stores. OnePlus phones also aren't compatible with Verizon, the US carrier with the most subscriptions. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderDespite this, OnePlus has an incredibly dedicated fanbase that lines up around city blocks around the world to buy the new model, much like iPhone fans line up to buy the new model. OnePlus phones are one of the only Android phones that gets people to line up.Fans covet the lower price tags and performance of OnePlus phones, which cost hundreds less than the competition from Apple and Samsung, and sometimes even exceed their performance. OnePlus phones also have excellent design, and they run on a largely unaltered version of the Android operating system that's especially popular among Android enthusiasts. When a customer walks into a T-Mobile store to buy a new phone, the OnePlus 6T's price tag, specs, and design are likely to be a tempting option compared to pricier devices on display. NOW WATCH: This machine perfectly pours concreteSee Also:4 of the coolest new features in the Samsung Galaxy Note 9I've used the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X — and the winner is clearThe Galaxy Note 9 is the closest competitor to the best smartphone camera in the world, the Pixel 2SEE ALSO: The Galaxy Note 9 is the closest competitor to the best smartphone camera in the world, the Pixel 2Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Indeed, selling covered calls can generate income while providing extra padding to your wallet with little risk.Covered calls are one of the strategies my stock advisory newsletter, The Liberty Portfolio, uses to reduce overall investment risk and generate extra income. With the best covered calls, you own a certain stock, or you buy it for the purpose of selling covered calls, and just use covered calls to make a little more money off of them in exchange for possibly selling earlier than you normally might.With covered calls you are selling the right for someone else to buy a stock from you at a certain price (strike price), on or before a specific day (expiration date).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYou do this because you believe the stock won’t trade above the strike price before expiration. If that stock does not close above that strike price before expiration for more than a couple of days, or does not close above that strike price on expiration, you both keep the money that you were paid for selling the contract, and also keep the stock.However, if the stock closes above the strike price on expiration, you will have to sell it at the strike price but you will still keep the premium. 10 Dividend Stocks to Buy With Low Yields, But Big Dividend Growth Here’s a way to generate income for the next month using covered calls on three blue-chip stocks.Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrMcDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has made quite a turnaround under its new CEO. I think MCD has good times ahead of it so owning McDonald’s stock is probably not a bad move for a long-term diversified portfolio.We’ve just been through a small market correction, and if MCD stock falls further, and you sell covered calls and the stock falls, you are likely getting it at a better price.Even if McDonald’s stock gets called away, and you buy back in, and then it falls again, I would not panic. That just means you can buy in at a lower price and average down. MCD will do well over the long term.MCD closed at $160 on Wednesday. You could sell the 23 March $160 covered calls for $3.55 at last check. You get a 2.22% premium and keep it if it isn’t called away.Or you could sell the 20 April $160 covered calls for $4.75, enjoy an almost 3% return, and have a nice little bit of income to the tune of $4.75, as well as earn $1.01 from its next dividend payment.Source: ShutterstockBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.B, NYSE:BRK.A) also has options available, but only for the B shares. I doubt very many people have 100 shares for a single options contract on the A shares, after all.Berkshire stock may be the perfect stock for covered calls. The premiums aren’t gigantic, but if the stock isn’t called away, then that premium you just sold could be thought of as a dividend. Remember, Berkshire stock doesn’t pay dividends. You can even generate dividend-like returns in the high single digits each year using covered calls.So, if BRK does get called away, buy it back and then perhaps go ahead and sell covered calls again. Over time, this strategy is going to throw off a nice little bit of income, and you may or may not miss some of the upside depending on how often the stock gets called away. 8 Companies That Could Disappear by 2019 Wednesday saw BRK.B stock end at $200.53. You can sell the 23 March covered calls at the $200 strike. If you elect to sell those covered calls for $5.75, you’ll earn a 2.78% in premium.Source: Phillip Capper via FlickrBoeing Co (NYSE:BA) is a strong candidate for selling covered calls. Boeing stock is a great security because not only does it deal in defense, which is always needed, but also because it is part of an oligopoly.Thus, should you sell covered calls on BA stock and it is called away, you can buy right back into it and continue holding over time. If BA stock should fall by a substantial amount, I might think of it as another buying opportunity. That’s the idea using blue-chip stocks — you don’t mind owning it.Boeing is not a volatile stock, so the premiums aren’t terribly large, but you are playing it safe and that’s the point.On Wednesday, BA stock closed at $345. The 16 March $345 covered calls are selling for $11, which is a 3.2% return.Lawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, a specialty lender focusing on consumer finance and is the Manager of The Liberty Portfolio at www.thelibertyportfolio.com.

The 5 Best Selling Handguns of 2018`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-best-selling-handguns-2018-142300545.html`2024-02-11 03-56-14`"Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsNews • 10 hours agoNews • 13 hours agoNews • 15 hours agoNews • 18 hours agoNews • 21 hours agoNews • yesterdayNews • yesterdayNews • 2 days agoNews • 2 days agoBreaking News • 2 days agoMorning Brief • 2 days agoNews • 2 days agoNews • 2 days agoNews • Feb 08, 2024News • Feb 08, 2024News • Feb 08, 2024News • Feb 08, 2024News • Feb 08, 2024Morning Brief • Feb 08, 2024News • Feb 08, 2024News • Feb 08, 2024News • Feb 08, 2024News • Feb 07, 2024News • Feb 07, 2024News • Feb 07, 2024News • Feb 07, 2024Breaking News • Feb 07, 2024News • Feb 07, 2024Morning Brief • Feb 07, 2024News • Feb 07, 2024News • Feb 07, 2024News • Feb 07, 2024Breaking News • Feb 06, 2024News • Feb 06, 2024Breaking News • Feb 06, 2024News • Feb 06, 2024Breaking News • Feb 06, 2024Morning Brief • Feb 06, 2024News • Feb 06, 2024News • Feb 06, 2024News • Feb 05, 2024News • Feb 05, 2024News • Feb 05, 2024News • Feb 05, 2024Morning Brief • Feb 05, 2024News • Feb 04, 2024News • Feb 04, 2024News • Feb 04, 2024News • Feb 04, 2024News • Feb 04, 2024It's been said that America loves its guns. To be sure, millions of handguns, rifles, and shotguns are sold domestically every year. Exactly what guns Americans are buying, however, is much harder to know.While federal law requires firearm dealers to record gun transactions, it bars that data from being compiled and stored in a central repository. In place of sales data, financial analysts can use the total number of background checks to gauge interest in firearms -- but that data offers no way of determining what guns are being purchased, and offers only limited insight into repeat buyers.Individual companies also offer few details on unit sales.SIG Sauer's hot-selling P365 Nitron Micro-Compact. Image source: SIG Sauer.Here's what we do know: Handguns are the most widely-produced type of firearm, representing about 40% of total firearms manufactured in 2016, the most recent year for which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has data. Handguns also represent more than 70% of total firearms imported into the United States.And although there have been concerns about gun demand based on background check data, firearms are unquestionably popular. Total firearm manufacturing is up more than 214% over the past 10 years, with 11.5 million units made in 2016. (The numbers exclude firearms manufactured for the U.S. military.)Absent any official tallies, I turned to GunBroker.com, the world's largest online auction site for firearms, which tracks and publishes monthly best sellers on its Gun Genius site. Gun Genius lists the leaders in every major category, but following the lead of my colleague Rich Duprey, I focused on new, semi-automatic handguns. I compiled the top five for the first 11 months of the year, and tallied them based on a rough scoring system.Thirteen different models made the list this year. Here are the top five finishers.The LCP, which stands for ""lightweight compact pistol,"" has been a top seller since its introduction in 2008, thanks to its compact design and affordable price. This handgun finished in the top spot in both 2016 and 2017, and continues to sell well despite newer competition.This is the only entry from Sturm, Ruger & Co. (NYSE: RGR) to make the top five. Company execs on a November call with investors said it is a buyer's market, with CEO Chris Killoy stating: ""If you go to the counter at any of the big box stores, you will see plenty of rebate counter cards out there with the tear-off coupons from a lot of our competitors."" Ruger, he said, does not discount as aggressively at the consumer level.Sturm, Ruger shares are down 12% since the company reported third quarter results on Oct. 31 that missed on both earnings and revenue. However, the shares have actually outperformed both the S&P 500 and rival American Outdoor Brands (NASDAQ: AOBC) over the past year.RGR and AOBC vs. S&P 500, data by YCharts.The P320, called the M17 in Army parlance, was chosen in 2017 to be the new standard issue U.S. Army pistol. The civilian version is quite popular as well, with its polymer build and a striker-based firing system that leaves fewer parts exposed.The P320 returns to this list for the second straight year despite a choppy history. Last fall, numerous videos surfaced warning that the firearm could accidentally discharge when dropped at a certain angle. The company issued a free upgraded part to correct the problem, and consumers seemingly have not shied away from buying the weapon in the months since.The original SIG Sauer was a Swiss-German partnership, but the company that produces these firearms today is privately-held SIG Sauer Inc. of New Hampshire.The Shield builds off of Smith & Wesson's well-regarded line of full-powered M&P pistols to create a more compact, lightweight version designed for personal protection.Smith & Wesson is owned by American Outdoor Brands, the other major publicly-traded U.S. firearms manufacturer. American Outdoor Brands shares have had a rocky year, but have been gaining strength since the company reported fiscal second quarter GAAP earnings and revenue that exceeded expectations on Dec. 6.On a call with analysts following the earnings report, CEO James Debney said American Outdoor Brands is gaining market share, noting that while handgun background checks in the quarter declined 8.8% year over year, the company's units shipped to distributors and retailers fell by just 1.9%.American Outdoor Brands is also in the process of moving to a new distribution facility in Missouri that should eventually reduce operating costs.The PMR-30 is another holdover from last year's list, moving up from a fifth-place tie. The 30-round, .22 magnum semi-automatic continues to be popular thanks to its light weight, low recoil, and reputation for durability.Privately-held Kel-Tec CNC Industries of Florida introduced the pistol to considerable fanfare in 2010, and added a rifle derivative, the CMR-30, in 2016. Kel-Tec used a combination of polymer and aluminum fittings around steel components to reduce the PMR-30's overall weight and make it easier for smaller hands to grip. The company also uses a European-style magazine release at the heel of the pistol rather than up by the trigger guard, which has proven popular with reviewers and consumers.This compact pistol, billed as ""the ultimate concealed carry pistol,"" was the runaway winner, entering the Gun Genius rankings in March in the top spot and remaining in that position for the entire year.As the name implies, this weapon has a compact design ideal for everyday handling, but it carries a powerful punch. The P365 fits 10 rounds in its miniature magazine, more than most compact handguns. SIG Sauer engineered this firearm from the ground up with the specific goal of coming in shorter, lighter, and thinner than almost anything in its class, which might explain the weapon's widespread popularity.If there is a conclusion to be drawn from this list, it is that compact and lightweight guns designed for the personal-protection buyer are the most popular. The industry knows this, and each company in the field is constantly looking to one-up the others with new design innovations. Expect another shootout in 2019.

Branson himself dropped out of school at 16 to launch Student magazine, his first venture, in 1968.Tuesday, the billionaire serial entrepreneur shared his three best pieces of advice for young and aspiring entrepreneurs.1. Start small""Start small but think big,"" says Branson, in a post on his blog . ""Many of Virgin's businesses have started off as side projects which have grown into big companies. Always be thinking about what could come next, how you could expand, how you could take your idea global. It will take time but if you're focused it's more likely to happen.""2. Say yes to opportunities""Always look for opportunities,"" says Branson. ""Don't be afraid to get out there and meet like-minded people. Always say yes to opportunities and learn what you need to do to make the most of them as you go along – I've constantly asked for help throughout my life.""3. Follow your passions""Do what you love – I can't stress this one enough,"" writes Branson. ""You'll spend a lot of your life working but if you're doing something that interests you and you're passionate about then you'll keep going even when it gets hard (and it will get tough). Think about your talents, what subjects and causes interest you the most, what problems you'd like to solve.""My three tips for young entrepreneurs:Branson was inspired to share the advice after meeting 13-year-old Iolo Edwards, from Wales. The teen had recently had his bowl removed due to acute severe ulcerative colitis and had a stoma bag (to collect waste).""He said he hated the stoma bags that he left hospital with — they were beige and looked really old-fashioned. He said he spent a long time looking at different products that would suit him better and settled with a plain black or white bag,"" Branson writes on his blog. ""He said there were loads of patterned bags for babies but nothing for teenagers — so they decided to make their own bags.""Edwards told Branson he also had another business selling Japanese air-dry clay and styrofoam craft balls online, which he'd started after noticing unusual demand on social media. He used his birthday money to buy the clay to resell, writes Branson, and he bought cheap balls in bulk then split it into smaller packets, selling two for the same price as a what he'd paid for a big bag.""He said he 'made a killing on that,'"" Branson writes.Iolo Edwards told me his moving story and how even in a challenging situation, he's finding ways to make his ideas come aliveEdwards, who also fundraises for the organizaton CIRCA , which supports children with Crohn's disease and Colitis, and his drive reminded Branson of his own young entrepreneurial efforts when he launched a mail order record business — it eventually became Virgin Records .""Hearing stories like Iolo's fills me with hope for the next generation and it's so interesting hearing all about the different ways young people are spotting and filling gaps in the market,"" Branson writes. ""The ways we do business may have changed dramatically since I started out as technology has advanced — as showcased by Iolo using Instagram as a way to find business — but the motivations and reasons for doing it remain the same. Iolo looked around himself and saw that he could do things better for other people. There's no better reason to start a business.""

An example of an investment might be a minority stake in a family-owned business. Similar to the approach of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., BlackRock would look to hold on to its stakes for a long time. Unlike famed investor Warren Buffett though, the fund might not buy a whole business.The Wall Street Journal reported the effort earlier Wednesday.The move may position BlackRock, which is headed by Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, to compete with private-equity giants such as Carlyle Group LP, Apollo Global Management LLC and Blackstone Group LP.BlackRock began in the headquarters of Blackstone, its first financial backer, which gave BlackRock a $5 million line of credit for a 40% stake. While business was picking up, the relationship between BlackRock and Blackstone became tense, Bloomberg has previously reported. Fink had a falling out with Blackstone co-founder Stephen Schwarzman in 1994 over BlackRock’s independence, resulting in the sale of BlackRock to PNC Financial Services Group Inc. for $240 million.BlackRock hopes to complete the fundraising by the middle of this year, the person said. The initiative will be overseen by Mark Wiseman with David Blumer, head of alternatives at the New York-based company. BlackRock hired Wiseman, the former head of Canada’s largest pension fund, in 2016 to run its global active equity business.BlackRock and Neuberger Berman Group are among firms that California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest U.S. pension fund, might look to partner with as it seeks help to manage its $40 billion private equity portfolio, people familiar with the matter said last month. The retirement system, which oversees more than $350 billion, sent requests for information in December to a group of asset managers seeking a “strategic partnership” for its private equity portfolio, according to a document released by Calpers.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

It's made by Knightscope, a company which makes crime-fighting robots that are used to patrol parking lots, sports arenas, and tech company campuses. A spokesman for BlackRock said its roll-out was part of a pilot, sharing with Business Insider a June 15 memo sent out to employees jokingly from the bot itself. Here's a humorous section: ""I know that my first days here were awkward at times,"" the note said. ""Seeing each other in the hallway, we often wondered - who’s going to move first?  But over time, we found ways to get along. Since then, I’ve made many new friends and starred in countless videos.""The robot, according to the memo, will be sent to the firm's San Francisco offices once its systems are upgraded and it learns to speak. While this is the first physical robot to appear at BlackRock, the firm has started to rely on more automation broadly to improve its actively managed stock picking unit. The move highlights how difficult it is for humans to beat the market. BlackRock also announced in 2017 a set of exchange-traded funds that would let a computer program choose and classify stocks. NOW WATCH: This impact investor says stop trying to help people without including them in the conversationSee Also:Share your opinion — Become a BI Insider todayCristiano Ronaldo: How the biggest sports star on the planet makes and spends his millions19 science-backed ways men can appear more attractive to womenTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

What is being negotiated with Canada, in the short run it looks good. All the actions with China in the short run, it’s good.”“What I’m worried about is the long term,” he continued. “In the long run, does the U.S. behaviors impair the world vitality?”Fink said that he’s been meeting with business and political leaders in Europe and Asia, who are concerned by the U.S.’s unilateralism.“What I heard consistently: some of the behaviors of the United States are leading more non-U.S. companies to pivot more towards China,” Fink said. The biggest fear across the board, he found, was a worry that the U.S.’s behavior could eventually lead to another major currency replacing the dollar as the currency of choice.The CEO of the world’s largest money manager explained that the foundations of finance of globalism have been multilateralism, and the long-term question is what happens if that goes away.“Does it change relationships, does it change allies, does it change the course of how we resolve problems?” he mused.Fink’s greatest fear in the long term, he said, is that “we don’t have the connections” that we have up until recently enjoyed in a multilateral, globalized world.“The world is less economically safe,” he added. “We all felt secure that this multilateralism would stabilize the world and now that multilateralism is breaking down. Populism is rising, focusing on individual needs of a country. And those issues, could — not saying will — create more volatility and greater problems.”Ethan Wolff-Mann is a senior writer at Yahoo Finance.More from Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit:White House economist: Tariffs are hurting China much more than the U.S.Larry Fink: The market will be higher in 10 yearsTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

""Overall, it's going to do wonderful things, especially for small businesses,"" he said on ""Squawk Box."" But Fink said he does not like some of the provisions. ""I'm still unhappy related to a few of the components of the tax bill; the state taxes."" During the tax reform debate, Fink had predicted the bill would not pass if it were to include a proposal to end the unlimited state and local tax deductions known as SALT. The end result was a SALT cap of $10,000 for a combination of state and local taxes including property taxes that filers can deduct from their federal returns. To help mitigate that change, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act almost doubles the standard income tax deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. But for many residents in high-tax states, that accommodation won't be enough to keep their tax bills from increasing. Fink also said that GOP tax writers should have eliminated the carried interest loophole, arguing that it's ""an unfair tax advantage."" Carried interest is a rule in the tax code that lets the managers of some types of private investment funds — hedge funds, private equity, venture capital, real estate and other types of vehicles — pay a lower rate than most individuals. Carried interest has been U.S. law for more than 50 years as an incentive for long-term investment. Top Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn said last month after the Republican tax bill was finalized that he regretted that carried interest was not cut. ""We would have cut carried interest,"" Cohn told Axios at the time . ""We probably tried 25 times."" Asked about the importance of companies possibly being incentivized to bring back some of the nearly $3 trillion held overseas, Fink said, ""Bringing money back is to me is not that significant."" Meanwhile, the U.S. corporate tax cut is a problem for Mexico because the rate is now lower in America, Fink said. Companies that had domiciled in Mexico for tax reasons are going to make their new tax homes in the U.S., he predicts. On the markets, Fink said BlackRock is still ""quite bullish"" on stocks. The BlackRock chairman and CEO also said retirement savers, even as old as 50 , should mostly be in stocks rather than bonds. That advice is counter to conventional asset allocation wisdom that long-term investors should have a portion of their portfolios in bonds. Fink's comments came shortly after BlackRock reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, and said that assets under management exceeded $6 trillion.Disclaimer More From CNBC Trump denies he called countries s---holes, rejects senators’ DACA dealTreasury lays out how new tax law will affect your take-home pay6 senators say they have an immigration deal — but others still need to sign onTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

This list gives a new spotlight to Latina women executives and amplifies their exposure across the country. In fact, three of the women on the list joined a corporate board last year.This year, the nominees for our Most Powerful Latina list nearly doubled, with 15 business leaders joining the list for the first time, including Jessica Alba, acclaimed actress and entrepreneur, at number 10. These 50 Latina executives are running Fortune 500 companies, large private firms, and a few are entrepreneurs leading global companies. The four-criteria used were: the size and importance of the woman’s business in the global economy, the health and direction of the business, the arc of the woman’s career—résumé and runway ahead—and their social and cultural influence.This year’s list of powerful Latina women prioritizes women leading large public companies with significant global operating roles, rather than c-level staff roles. It then ranks Latina women operating large private firms and, finally, entrepreneurs who have successfully scaled their businesses into the middle market.The accomplishments of these powerful Latinas are significant. The list serves as a platform to continue their legacy and amplify their voices to inspire the next generation of women.These women have received powerful advice along the way.

The company is currently worth US$186b, and now yields roughly 2.6%. Should it have a place in your portfolio? Let’s take a look at Boeing in more detail.  See our latest analysis for Boeing  When assessing a stock as a potential addition to my dividend Portfolio, I look at these five areas:Is it the top 25% annual dividend yield payer?Has its dividend been stable over the past (i.e. no missed payments or significant payout cuts)?Has dividend per share risen in the past couple of years?Does earnings amply cover its dividend payments?Will it have the ability to keep paying its dividends going forward?Boeing has a trailing twelve-month payout ratio of 38%, meaning the dividend is sufficiently covered by earnings. In the near future, analysts are predicting a higher payout ratio of 43% which, assuming the share price stays the same, leads to a dividend yield of 2.5%. Moreover, EPS should increase to $19.33. The higher payout forecasted, along with higher earnings, should lead to greater dividend income for investors moving forward.When thinking about whether a dividend is sustainable, another factor to consider is the cash flow. A business with strong cash flow can sustain a higher divided payout ratio than a company with weak cash flow.Reliablity is an important factor for dividend stocks, particularly for income investors who want a strong track record of payment and a positive outlook for future payout. BA has increased its DPS from $1.68 to $8.22 in the past 10 years. During this period it has not missed a payment, as one would expect for a company increasing its dividend. This is an impressive feat, which makes BA a true dividend rockstar.In terms of its peers, Boeing has a yield of 2.6%, which is high for Aerospace & Defense stocks but still below the market’s top dividend payers.With this in mind, I definitely rank Boeing as a strong dividend stock, and makes it worth further research for anyone who likes steady income generation from their portfolio. Given that this is purely a dividend analysis, you should always research extensively before deciding whether or not a stock is an appropriate investment for you. I always recommend analysing the company’s fundamentals and underlying business before making an investment decision. I’ve put together three pertinent factors you should further examine:Future Outlook: What are well-informed industry analysts predicting for BA’s future growth?

Doing business globally, large caps tend to have diversified revenue streams and attractive capital returns, making them desirable investments for risk-averse portfolios. However, the health of the financials determines whether the company continues to succeed. Today we will look at Boeing’s financial liquidity and debt levels, which are strong indicators for whether the company can weather economic downturns or fund strategic acquisitions for future growth. Note that this commentary is very high-level and solely focused on financial health, so I suggest you dig deeper yourself into BA here.   View out our latest analysis for Boeing  Over the past year, BA has ramped up its debt from US$9.95b to US$11.12b – this includes both the current and long-term debt. With this increase in debt, BA’s cash and short-term investments stands at US$9.99b for investing into the business. Additionally, BA has generated cash from operations of US$13.34b in the last twelve months, leading to an operating cash to total debt ratio of 120.03%, meaning that BA’s debt is appropriately covered by operating cash. This ratio can also be interpreted as a measure of efficiency as an alternative to return on assets. In BA’s case, it is able to generate 1.2x cash from its debt capital.At the current liabilities level of US$56.27b liabilities, it appears that the company has been able to meet these obligations given the level of current assets of US$65.16b, with a current ratio of 1.16x. For Aerospace & Defense companies, this ratio is within a sensible range as there’s enough of a cash buffer without holding too capital in low return investments.Considering Boeing’s total debt outweighs its equity, the company is deemed highly levered. This isn’t uncommon for large companies because interest payments on debt are tax deductible, meaning debt can be a cheaper source of capital than equity. Consequently, larger-cap organisations tend to enjoy lower cost of capital as a result of easily attained financing, providing an advantage over smaller companies. No matter how high the company’s debt, if it can easily cover the interest payments, it’s considered to be efficient with its use of excess leverage. As a rule of thumb, a company should have earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of at least three times the size of net interest. In BA’s case, the ratio of 60.26x suggests that interest is amply covered. It is considered a responsible and reassuring practice to maintain high interest coverage, which makes BA and other large-cap investments thought to be safe.BA’s high cash coverage means that, although its debt levels are high, the company is able to utilise its borrowings efficiently in order to generate cash flow. Since there is also no concerns around BA’s liquidity needs, this may be its optimal capital structure for the time being. I admit this is a fairly basic analysis for BA’s financial health. Other important fundamentals need to be considered alongside.

To address that, Boeing put in place more anti-stall protections, Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said in an online post.An automated protection system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) kicks in when the angle of attack is too high, when the plane's nose is too elevated, threatening a stall.WHAT IS 'ANGLE OF ATTACK'?On paper, it measures the angle between the air flow and the wing. But it is so fundamental to flight that historians say the only instrument on the Wright Brothers' first aircraft was a piece of yarn designed to measure it. (https://bit.ly/2KcBlVT)If the angle of attack is too high, the airflow over the wing is disturbed, throwing the plane into an aerodynamic stall.One of two angle of attack sensors on the Lion Air jet was faulty, according to Indonesian investigators.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last week warned airlines that erroneous inputs from those sensors could lead the jet automatically to pitch its nose down even when autopilot is turned off, making it difficult for pilots to control.WHICH AIRLINES OPERATE THE 737 MAX?Boeing has delivered 241 of the jets to customers since it entered service last year, according to its website.Major operators include Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, Norwegian, Lion Air, Air Canada, China Southern, China Eastern and flydubai.Another 4,542 have been ordered but not yet delivered.WHAT DID AIRLINES AND PILOTS KNOW ABOUT THE SYSTEM?Lion Air's flight manual did not contain information about the new anti-stall system, according to investigators and an airplane flight manual seen by Reuters. U.S. pilots were also not made aware in training courses, pilot unions say.American Airlines said it was ""unaware"" of some of the functionality of the MCAS system. [L4N1XQ23Q]Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Fox Business Network on Tuesday that Boeing provides ""all of the information that's needed to safely fly our airplanes"".HOW WOULD A PILOT SHUT OFF THE SYSTEM?Pilots can stop the automated response by pressing two buttons if the system behaves unexpectedly, the FAA says.That action is set out in a checklist used by Lion Air pilots for in-air troubleshooting, an instructor said. It is also required to be committed to memory by pilots.Pilots on a flight from Jakarta to Bali the day before the crash experienced a similar sensor issue but managed to land safely by turning off the system, the New York Times reported.HOW WAS THE SYSTEM APPROVED?The FAA holds the main responsibility for certifying Boeing jets and training programs for pilots, but local regulators also issue approvals for airlines based in their countries.An unresolved question is how Boeing measured the system's reliability and on what basis the FAA certified it as safe.HOW ARE PILOTS TRAINED?An FAA document on training requirements for 737 MAX pilots transitioning from the older 737NG, available online (https://bit.ly/2B8qhG5), has no reference to the new anti-stall system.Lion Air says it followed a training regime approved by U.S. and European regulators. The training was restricted to three hours of computer-based training and a familiarization flight.However, Brazil's regulator told Reuters that it had required specific training for pilots on the anti-stall system.WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE THE CRASH?Boeing last week issued a bulletin to airlines reiterating existing procedures and advising them to add information on the anti-stall system to flight manuals, which was quickly followed by an FAA directive making that mandatory.The FAA and Boeing are studying the need for software changes, as well as revisions to training and operating procedures on the 737 MAX, the regulator said.WHEN WILL THE FIRST REPORT ON THE CRASH BE RELEASED?A preliminary report will be released on Nov. 28 or 29, according to Indonesian investigators. However, divers have yet to locate the airline's cockpit voice recorder, which would shed light on pilot interactions that are important for gaining a fuller picture of the circumstances of the crash.(Reporting by Jamie Freed in Singapore, Tim Hepher in Paris, David Shepardson in Washington, Eric M.

To address that, Boeing put in place more anti-stall protections, Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said in an online post.An automated protection system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) kicks in when the angle of attack is too high, when the plane's nose is too elevated, threatening a stall.WHAT IS 'ANGLE OF ATTACK'?On paper, it measures the angle between the air flow and the wing. But it is so fundamental to flight that historians say the only instrument on the Wright Brothers' first aircraft was a piece of yarn designed to measure it. (https://bit.ly/2KcBlVT)If the angle of attack is too high, the airflow over the wing is disturbed, throwing the plane into an aerodynamic stall.One of two angle of attack sensors on the Lion Air jet was faulty, according to Indonesian investigators.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last week warned airlines that erroneous inputs from those sensors could lead the jet automatically to pitch its nose down even when autopilot is turned off, making it difficult for pilots to control.WHICH AIRLINES OPERATE THE 737 MAX?Boeing has delivered 241 of the jets to customers since it entered service last year, according to its website.Major operators include Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, Norwegian, Lion Air, Air Canada, China Southern, China Eastern and flydubai.Another 4,542 have been ordered but not yet delivered.WHAT DID AIRLINES AND PILOTS KNOW ABOUT THE SYSTEM?Lion Air's flight manual did not contain information about the new anti-stall system, according to investigators and an airplane flight manual seen by Reuters. U.S. pilots were also not made aware in training courses, pilot unions say.American Airlines said it was ""unaware"" of some of the functionality of the MCAS system. [L4N1XQ23Q]Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Fox Business Network on Tuesday that Boeing provides ""all of the information that's needed to safely fly our airplanes"".HOW WOULD A PILOT SHUT OFF THE SYSTEM?Pilots can stop the automated response by pressing two buttons if the system behaves unexpectedly, the FAA says.That action is set out in a checklist used by Lion Air pilots for in-air troubleshooting, an instructor said. It is also required to be committed to memory by pilots.Pilots on a flight from Jakarta to Bali the day before the crash experienced a similar sensor issue but managed to land safely by turning off the system, the New York Times reported.HOW WAS THE SYSTEM APPROVED?The FAA holds the main responsibility for certifying Boeing jets and training programs for pilots, but local regulators also issue approvals for airlines based in their countries.An unresolved question is how Boeing measured the system's reliability and on what basis the FAA certified it as safe.HOW ARE PILOTS TRAINED?An FAA document on training requirements for 737 MAX pilots transitioning from the older 737NG, available online (https://bit.ly/2B8qhG5), has no reference to the new anti-stall system.Lion Air says it followed a training regime approved by U.S. and European regulators. The training was restricted to three hours of computer-based training and a familiarization flight.However, Brazil's regulator told Reuters that it had required specific training for pilots on the anti-stall system.WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE THE CRASH?Boeing last week issued a bulletin to airlines reiterating existing procedures and advising them to add information on the anti-stall system to flight manuals, which was quickly followed by an FAA directive making that mandatory.The FAA and Boeing are studying the need for software changes, as well as revisions to training and operating procedures on the 737 MAX, the regulator said.WHEN WILL THE FIRST REPORT ON THE CRASH BE RELEASED?A preliminary report will be released on Nov. 28 or 29, according to Indonesian investigators. However, divers have yet to locate the airline's cockpit voice recorder, which would shed light on pilot interactions that are important for gaining a fuller picture of the circumstances of the crash.(Reporting by Jamie Freed in Singapore, Tim Hepher in Paris, David Shepardson in Washington, Eric M.

But in 2023 (or 2024 at the latest), Russia plans to take that investment apart -- detaching Russian-built sections of the ISS, and moving them into a new orbit to form the core of a new, all-Russian station.By now, this should be old news for you, but here's something new: President Donald Trump supports the Russian plan to abandon the ISS, and plans to cut off U.S. government support for the station as early as 2025. Boeing is not a big fan of the idea, as NASA currently pays it to help operate the station, and has awarded Boeing a multibillion-dollar contract to transport astronauts to the ISS. So Boeing has gone on record opposing the idea of ""walking away"" from it.When Russia and NASA walk away from the the space station, investment opportunities will arrive. Image source: Getty Images.But as we learned from the just-released NASA 2019 budget proposal, this plan is now a go, and NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot says the Trump administration wants to ""end direct federal government support of the ISS in 2025.""From that point onward, says Lightfoot, NASA will outsource ""low-earth-orbit research and technology demonstration"" missions to ""commercial partners.""Money does not grow on trees -- especially not in space. Much as NASA loves space exploration, budget constraints necessitate picking and choosing the work it can afford to support, and outsourcing the rest. In saving money by cutting the ISS loose, NASA said that it hopes to free up funds to instead:fund development of the ""Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft,"" targeting a robotic flight ""around the moon"" in 2020 and a first crewed mission in 2023.sponsor ""progressively complex robotic missions to the surface of the moon.""""return ... humans to the moon for long-term exploration and use.""build a ""power and propulsion element to orbit the moon as the foundation of a Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway.""and thereby support ""human missions to Mars and other destinations.""And if you ask me, this is what investors should really be focusing on -- not NASA's abandoning the space station, and potentially terminating contracts for Boeing, Orbital ATK (NYSE: OA), SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada to build rocketships to staff and supply it.Instead, I think investors should focus on the potential for new and different contracts being awarded for all the other space missions NASA will be able to undertake once released from the ISS cash drain.Currently, NASA devotes as much as 20% of its budget to supporting the ISS -- anywhere from $3 billion to $4 billion annually. That's money that could perhaps be better spent accelerating development of the Space Launch System, still under development by a team of contractors that includes Boeing and Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK and Aerojet Rocketdyne. It's a source of funds for building a cislunar outpost to facilitate missions to the moon and Mars, and to pay for initial efforts at returning mankind to the Moon -- and mining it.And even before the ISS is handed over to private industry to operate, there may be opportunities for investment. To facilitate the station's transition to private ownership, the administration is asking Congress to allocate $150 million to NASA in 2019, and recommending NASA ""expand international and commercial partnerships"" to operate the ISS ""over the next seven years.""And during this interim period, the administration wants to boost NASA's budget to pay for ""development and maturation of commercial entities and capabilities [that will become] commercial successors to the ISS."" This, too, will cost money -- and could give rise to an entirely new set of (perhaps eventually public) companies working to make the ISS a commercially viable operation.Already, privately held Made in Space has a 3D printer aboard the station, and as that technology develops, it's conceivable the ISS and other space stations could ""print"" their own replacement parts on-site. Bigelow Aerospace -- also private today -- has for months been testing an inflatable module attached to the ISS, which could one day replace the sections Russia will be detaching. Similarly, established space companies like Boeing, Lockheed, and Orbital have all proposed novel alternatives for converting spent rocket sections into habitable living space for the ISS, or for a new space station.Axiom Space -- which, you guessed it, is also private -- has a plan to build an entire new space station to replace the ISS when, at some point in the future, it is finally decommissioned and taken out of orbit. And Axiom says the cost of its space station will be at least an order of magnitude cheaper than what NASA spent to build the original ISS (i.e., if the ISS cost $100 billion, then an ""Axiom Station"" might cost only $10 billion).If you ask me, NASA is making the right call in getting out of the space station business -- and getting out of the way of private industry.As Lightfoot says: NASA ""can't do everything, and as always, we've had to make hard choices, but we will continue to forge new paths and partnerships that strengthen our industrial base and our engagement with other nations to achieve challenging goals that advance our capabilities and increase our security and economic strength.""While we'll certainly be sad to see the ISS go, I think we can all support NASA's decision to move out of low earth orbit, and expand the borders of the final frontier.

Jackson was arrested and brought to Dallas County jail in 2016 after she forgot to remove a firearm from her bag before going to the airport.The suit claims that, during the booking process, jail employees inquired about Jackson’s gender, and she told them she was female. Jackson alleges she was later instructed to pull down her pants and underwear, and when Jackson asked why she needed to do this, she was told, “We need to know if you’ve had a sex change or not. We need to see if you have a penis or a vagina. We have to protect you. We can’t put you with men if you have a vagina.”Jackson responded that she was not going to pull her pants and underwear down, and that she should not have to prove anything to them if none of the other women in jail had to prove anything, the suit claims. She alleges that an officer later replied, “You are coming up in the system as male. It doesn’t matter what you do, it can never be changed.”Jackson later relented and pulled her pants and underwear down to her knees so the officers could verify her genitalia and gender, she claims. She was later placed with men and was referred to as “Mr. Jackson” by a bailiff when taken to court for a pretrial hearing, according to the suit.“Ms. Jackson was humiliated every time she encountered a new officer. Each time, they would see her and reference her as a woman, only to be told by whichever officer was escorting her in front of everyone that she was a man,” the complaint alleges. “All Ms. Jackson was able to do was cry as she suffered the worst humiliation of her entire life.""After being released from custody in 2016, Jackson filed a formal complaint regarding her treatment in the jail.In 2017, Jackson was arrested for a second time, was taken to jail and was again placed with male inmates. She was forced to shower with men, where one of the male inmates masturbated while staring at her, she claims.Jackson was arrested for a third time in 2018 and was again placed with male inmates, and was again forced to shower while a male inmate masturbated to her, she claims.“Ms. Jackson suffered severe mental anguish as a result of the unconstitutional searches and harassment she endured,” according to the complaint, which claims she was subjected to an invasive and unconstitutional search.“The unconstitutional search to ‘observe’ her genitals and allegedly to ‘determine’ Ms. Jackson’s gender and the harassment that accompanied her incarceration was objectively unreasonable as it violated Dallas County Sheriff’s Office written policy and violated plaintiff’s rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.’’The lawsuit names as defendants Lupe Valdez, who served as Dallas County Sheriff from 2005 until January 2018, as well as Marian Brown, who is the current sheriff, among others.Valdez was the first lesbian and Latina to serve as Dallas sheriff, while Brown is the first African-American woman to hold the job.Raul Reyna, a spokesman for the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office, declined to comment on the pending lawsuit.Scott Palmer, a Dallas attorney who represents Jackson, noted that the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office has a nine-page policy that states its employees “will not exhibit any bias, prejudice, or discriminate against any individual or group, including the transgender/intersex/gender nonconforming community.”“The problem is the pattern and practice is completely different from the written policy. Either they don’t know it, or they are not trained. They were not supposed to do this with this woman,” Palmer said. “She complained about it immediately after it happened. Jail is bad enough, and to be transgender and be humiliated makes it 10 times worse.’’“Failure to train is the hardest thing to prove in civil rights cases,” Palmer added. “But I think we have a really good claim here.’’Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, Sidley Austin, Kirkland & Ellis and DLA Piper are just some of the Am Law 100 firms that have been busy hiring in Boston within the past few weeks, staffing offices in the city both new and old. McDermott Will & Emery, which late last year sought to expand its financial technology expertise by adding a three-lawyer team from Debevoise & Plimpton, is now poised to expand its intellectual property practice in Boston by bringing on partner Kristina ""Kris"" Bieker-Brady from Boston-based IP boutique Clark & Elbing. Bieker-Brady, who holds a doctorate in molecular biology from Princeton University, began her legal career as a patent agent at noted IP-focused firm Fish & Richardson. Upon graduation from Boston College Law School in 1996, she co-founded Clark & Elbing, where since 2010 she has served on the firm's three-partner managing committee. For more than 20 years, Bieker-Brady has handled a variety of IP matters for life sciences companies, such as patent prosecution, life cycle management, licensing and collaboration strategies and patent strategy. But as Bieker-Brady's client base grew, it began demanding more than what the 10-lawyer life sciences prosecution firm could handle, she said. “My clients grew to the point they were doing [initial public offerings], M&A activity and a lot of financings,” said Bieker-Brady, who also works with many early-stage companies in the life sciences sector. “It was getting lonely over there being in a prosecution-only firm, because I didn’t have any securities counsel and what not.” Part of what Bieker-Brady aims to accomplish in her move to McDermott, which was handled by Gary Cadogan of JR Search, a broker for many a notable Big Law move in Boston, is to create a team-based model that will combine lawyers from different practice areas to deliver legal services to emerging life science companies. By tapping into the IP bench strength and global platform that McDermott already has and by linking up with a larger life sciences group, Bieker-Brady sees an opportunity to create a long-term strategy to capture and capitalize on such client work. “My whole discussion with McDermott from day one was about doing [this] because it’s clear my clients needed it,” Bieker-Brady said. “Almost all of them, even the early-stage clients, almost always use a minimum of three firms and it’s the client that manages the interface. So there’s a huge amount of slippage both economically, but more importantly, informationally.” McDermott's Boston office opened in 1981 and now has more than 50 lawyers working on matters in the life sciences, private equity and technology space, areas that have driven many of the firm's Am Law 100 competitors into the city over the past year. “The life sciences sector is one of the fastest-growing industries in the nation, especially in Boston,” said a statement from Sarah Columbia, a member of McDermott’s management committee and a former head of its IP practice. “We look forward to having [Bieker-Brady] join our team and bring her IP prowess in the life sciences arena to bear for clients both here in Boston and across McDermott’s global platform.” McDermott, which ushered in new leadership in late 2016, has watched several former practice leaders leave for other firms in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Latham & Watkins welcomed McDermott's former tax controversy co-chair Jean Pawlow as a partner in Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., a move that came after Polsinelli picked up five IP litigators from McDermott, including Fabio Marino, the former leader of its Northern California IP practice. Brian Gaff, another IP litigator with McDermott in Boston, joined Fish & Richardson before Thanksgiving. Kirkland also hired McDermott private equity partner Michael Sartor in Boston shortly after Christmas, although McDermott recently hired former Kirkland associate Paul Helms as a partner for its government and internal investigations practice in Chicago. Helms spent nearly the past eight years as an enforcement lawyer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In October, McDermott recruited Christopher Adams, a former managing director and head of discovery consulting at Consilio LLC in Washington, D.C., to serve as chief strategic counsel for a new electronic discovery unit in the nation's capital.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

The fast-growing Am Law 100 firm, which set up shop in the city two years ago after absorbing the bulk of intellectual property boutique Novak Druce Connolly Bove + Quigg, has brought on longtime Ropes & Gray counsel Daniel Adams and former Locke Lord partner James Coffey as partners for its corporate and transactional group. Adams, who joins Polsinelli as vice chair of its sports industry group, said the impetus for his move to the firm was the opportunity to build out its budding sports law practice, as well as his new firm's office in Boston. The outpost is somewhat ironically based at One International Place, an office tower where Ropes & Gray used to be based until the firm left for new commercial space in 2010. Adams first joined Ropes & Gray in 2004, working on various private equity matters. But over time, he began working with Dennis Coleman, the Boston-based chair of the firm’s sports law group and a partner who has worked with clients such as the National Football League, Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox and the National Basketball Association's Detroit Pistons. [caption id=""attachment_12491"" align=""alignright"" width=""245""]Daniel Adams[/caption] “After a while … I started to focus 100 percent on sports,” said Adams, who recently represented a private equity client in connection with a $4 billion bid to buy the Ultimate Fighting Championship, an enterprise that was ultimately sold for that price in 2016 to William Morris Endeavor Entertainment LLC and a group of private equity investors. And as that deal progressed, Adams said it required a different platform than what was available at Ropes & Gray. “So I started to keep my eyes open for a different platform and looked to see what kind of clients other law firms had,” said Adams, adding that he soon happened upon Polsinelli, which already had in place its own sports law group. Adams began talking with Kevin Sweeney, chair of Polsinelli’s life science practice group, who has counseled collegiate conferences and amateur sports organizations for nearly three decades. Adams has advised his own collection of sports industry clients, which include professional teams, leagues and broadcast entities in negotiating licensing, partnerships, joint ventures, broadcast and multimedia rights deals, amongst other matters. “It honestly fit perfect with how my client base was developing and felt like this was a better platform if I wanted to continue to do it for the next 25 years, which I plan to do,” said Adams, who while a first-year associate at Ropes & Gray more than a decade ago battled and beat a rare bone marrow disorder. ""It was a life changer, but I certainly didn’t let it define me."" On the heels of Adams’ addition to Posinelli's Boston office, located at the intersection between the city’s historic Financial District and its new budding Seaport Innovation District, his new firm also announced its addition of Coffey, an M&A expert. Coffey began his legal career at Nutter McClennen & Fish, where he was a partner in the Boston-based firm's business department. In 2013, Coffey jumped to Carter & English, where he spent two years before making another move to White and Williams. In early 2017, Coffey once again dipped into the lateral market, landing at Locke Lord. “[Coffey] is one of the top corporate and transactional attorneys in the Boston area, and is well-known for his superior M&A work,” said a statement from Polsinelli's corporate chair Jonathan Henderson. “He brings nearly three decades of experience to our team, which will greatly benefit our clients in achieving their M&A related strategic business goals.” Polsinelli’s additions are just the latest in a flurry of Big Law activity in Boston. Hogan Lovells, Kirkland & Ellis, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Womble Bond Dickinson have all opened up their own respective offices in the city, looking to capitalize on Boston’s booming industries and talent pool. Just last month, Hunton & Williams—now known as Hunton Andrews Kurth following a recent merger with Andrews Kurth Kenyon—opened an office in Boston following its 14-lawyer raid on litigation boutique Manion Gaynor & Manning.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Atwood, whose hired by Kirkland was announced Monday, specializes in M&A deals with a focus on private equity funds and their portfolio companies. During his nearly 18 years at Choate Hall, Atwood has represented private equity clients like Avista Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Intervale Capital, New Heritage Capital and The Blackstone Group LP. Atwood said he was convinced that he would spend his entire career at Choate Hall, a Boston-based Am Law 200 firm he joined as a summer associate in 2000. But after Kirkland set up shop in Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood in May 2017, Atwood received a call from Kirkland corporate partner and executive committee member Jon Ballis in Chicago, who asked to meet for a cup of coffee and discuss the possibility of him coming aboard. “The more I thought about it and the more we talked about it, the more excited I became about what I thought I could do on this platform and with the additional resources that Kirkland brings to bear,” said Atwood, who was named a “Boston Rising Star” by sibling publication The National Law Journal in 2015. [caption id=""attachment_6627"" align=""alignright"" width=""245""]Christian Atwood[/caption] Atwood, who spoke with Forbes.com last year about Choate Hall’s middle-market focus in the private equity arena, admitted that part of his attraction to Kirkland was the opportunity to capitalize on the global legal giant’s geographic platform, its various subject matter experts and the depth of its bench to service his existing clients, including those based inside and out of Boston. What also enticed Atwood, he said, was the opportunity to be entrepreneurial in building out a new office in Boston for a large, well-established firm like Kirkland. “I think we can build a really successful office here with the Kirkland brand, with the talent that’s already here and with additional talent that I’m sure we’ll add over time,” Atwood said. Kirkland, which has had success in recent years using strategic lateral hires to quickly acquire scale in new cities, such as Houston (where the firm set up shop in 2014), has been busy in recent months hiring in Boston. In late December, Kirkland added McDermott Will & Emery partner Michael Sartor in the city, only a few months after recruiting Ropes & Gray private equity partner Jason Serlenga and Proskauer Rose partners Sean Hill and Stephanie Berdik. But Kirkland isn’t the only large law firm trying to carve out a niche in Boston, a key hub for the life sciences, engineering, private equity and technology sectors. DLA Piper recently reeled in Adam Ghander, co-chair of the private equity group at Boston-based Nutter McClennen & Fish, while litigation powerhouse Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and the newly formed Womble Bond Dickinson have also moved to start offices in the city.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

The result was underwhelming as Wall Street investors were not impressed by the end result.Analysts said that the phase 1/2 clinical trial data was “underwhelming” and “immature,” sending both stocks dropping early Monday. The effort was designed to create a treatment that combines two cancer drugs, a move that many companies have been making lately to improve patient outcomes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOpdivo is a popular and effective cancer drug as things stand and the trial was supposed to prove that NKTR-214 enhances the effects of Opdivo when linked up to the drug. The move is especially disappointing considering that Bristol-Myers announced the $1.85 million deal with Nektar on Valentine’s Day and it had great expectations of the combination of these drugs.The February move was designed to limit Bristol-Myers’ upfront payments and its risk. The deal made Nektar eligible for up to $1.78 billion in milestone payments and allowed for profit sharing geared in Nektar’s favor, which saw Bristol-Myers get a 35% cut of net profits and losses for NKTR-214.BMY stock fell about 3.3% on Monday as the company’s cancer drug disappointed, while NKTR shares plummeted 43.6% today. 7 Great REITs to Own in Good Times and Bad  8 Companies That Could Disappear by 2019  10 Dividend Stocks to Buy With Low Yields, But Big Dividend Growth  Compare Brokers The post Why Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Shares Are Down Today appeared first on InvestorPlace.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Recently, a well-regarded analyst said the partnered treatment isn't worth a nickel and investors are getting worried Bristol may have made a terrible mistake.In February, Bristol-Myers Squibb shelled out $1.85 billion up front for rights to NKTR-214 because it looked like Nektar's candidate could eventually boost sales of Bristol's lead drug. Just how dire is the case for Bristol-Myers and its investment? Here's what you need to know.Image source: Getty Images.The candidate Bristol wants to pair with its cancer therapy is supposed to dial up an attack on cancer cells by activating the patient's cancer-killing T-cells. According to Nektar, NKTR-214 is especially useful because it's pegylated to make it last longer in the bloodstream.According to an ex-Kerrisdale analyst, Aaron Wedlund, NKTR-214 is simply a pegylated form of a well-understood, naturally occurring cytokine known as interleukin 2 (IL2). His scathing report also contends that adding propylene glycol to IL2 makes it mostly useless. Unfortunately for Nektar and Bristol, clinical trial results suggest Wedlund is on to something.During the early-stage Excel trial, 28 cancer patients received NKTR-214 on its own and not one exhibited signs of tumor shrinkage. Proleukin is essentially un-pegylated IL2 that's been around for decades and during studies that led to its approval, it shrank or completely removed tumors for around 15% of patients who took it.Image source: Getty Images.It's hard to believe that Bristol-Myers committed billions to NKTR-214 without understanding the potential pitfalls that Wedlund unearthed. That said, there were some interesting results exhibited last year that may have distracted the big pharma from doing its homework. Last June, investigators showed us that during the first part of the Pivot-2 study, NKTR-214 plus Opdivo led to tumor responses among 72% of patients with advanced-stage cancer.Since then, however, expectations for the drug have fallen along with observed response rates across the board. In November, 71% of 13 kidney cancer patients showed tumor responses, but six months later, the response rate in that group fell to just 54% of 24 patients. During the latest update, Nektar shared data from roughly one-third of the 283 patients enrolled in the trial. If those we haven't seen data for performed any worse, Bristol's investment into Nektar will look like an awful mistake.Earlier this year, epacadostat failed to improve the performance of a drug similar to Opdivo in a full-sized pivotal study. Epacadostat was a novel new approach that showed a 56% overall response rate in an early study with melanoma patients. With response rates for NKTR-214 around the same level, investors are justifiably nervous about its ability to outperform Opdivo on its own.Even if adding NKTR-214 to Opdivo actually provides a significant benefit, it's launch could be far more difficult than Bristol-Myers anticipated when striking its deal with Nektar. A year of Opdivo treatment expenses run into six figures and adding a second new cancer drug would cost a lot more than insurers are probably prepared to pay when there might be a much cheaper option.Image source: Getty Images.Keytruda from Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK) takes the brakes off the immune system so it can fight cancer in the same way as Opdivo. Earlier this year, we learned that adding Keytruda to standard chemotherapy led to a 51% reduction in the risk of death for newly diagnosed lung cancer patients.Given the relatively low cost of chemotherapy compared to new cancer drugs that generally cost six figures annually, NKTR-214 plus Opdivo needs to outperform Keytruda plus chemotherapy at a rate that end payers can't ignore. Even if all goes well for NKTR-214 and Opdivo from here on out, the combo's chance to eventually generate significant sales doesn't look good.In the first half of 2018, Opdivo sales rose 35% to $3.1 billion and a recent approval to treat second-line small-cell lung cancer patients will help provide further growth. Around 10% to 15% of lung cancer cases are of the small-cell variety, but these patients haven't seen a new treatment option in decades.In the second quarter, Bristol-Myers began selling Yervoy plus Opdivo to newly diagnosed kidney cancer patients. While this indication isn't nearly as large as lung cancer, it could begin adding more than $1 billion to total annual sales within a couple of years. Although Bristol's deal with Nektar is beginning to look like a big mistake, it's one the big pharma company can probably afford to make.

Broadcom and CA representatives didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Under Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan, Broadcom has transformed itself through a string of acquisitions into one of the world's largest chipmakers. Last year, Tan launched an ambitious attempt to grow even bigger — through the purchase of rival mobile-chip maker Inc. That hostile takeover bid was blocked in March by the U.S government on national-security grounds. With a deal for CA, Broadcom is seeking to move into software used to manage business planning and other processes.Shares of New York-based CA jumped 15 percent in extended trading on reports of the potential deal. Broadcom stock fell 5.5 percent. After the rejection of its Qualcomm bid, the San Jose, California-based company — which relocated its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore earlier this year — had said it would probably avoid large purchases and concentrate on returning cash to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends.The agreement was reported earlier Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Senator Rand Paul called for a national security panel to investigate the $19 billion acquisition by Broadcom, a semiconductor maker, of software company CA, which the companies have said will close by the end of the year.Read More: Broadcom Can’t Shake Scrutiny as Senator Wants Probe of CA DealBroadcom contacted the authorities about the memo and was told that investigations had been initiated, according to one of the people familiar with the situation.They said the Justice Department’s probe is being handled out of the Southern District of New York, which has jurisdiction over Wall Street and often spearheads enforcement of stock manipulation and other securities fraud cases.Broadcom’s shares rose as much as 3 percent in early trading in New York and were up 1.9 percent to 233.17 at 10:40 a.m. CA’s shares were little changed.Representatives for the Justice Department and SEC declined to comment.Authorities typically launch investigations following a public fraud claim such as the one made by Broadcom. The probes into the memo are preliminary and may not conclude that anyone attempted to manipulate Broadcom’s stock price.A memo matching the one described to Broadcom was provided to Bloomberg anonymously earlier this week. The four-page document, which Bloomberg has not published, purported to be written by an official inside the Defense Department.The author argued that Broadcom, while domiciled in the U.S., has deep ties to China. The author said that Broadcom’s purchase should come under scrutiny because CA makes software for strategic financial, energy and government applications. Axios has also reported, following Broadcom’s claims of a fraudulent memo, that it received such a document.The Defense Department, in a statement, said: ""Our initial assessment is that this is likely a fraudulent document.""Concerns similar to those outlined in the memo were raised by Senator Paul at a Senate hearing on Wednesday. Paul said later in the day he had sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin seeking a security review of the deal by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius. Paul’s office said it hadn’t seen the memo in question and that it made its request out of national security concerns.Treasury officials lead Cfius, whose members also include representatives of the Defense, Homeland Security and State and other departments. The committee previously reviewed Broadcom’s proposed takeover of Qualcomm Inc., which was blocked by President Donald Trump earlier this year.The company has since moved its headquarters to the U.S. and says it isn’t subject to a Cfius review. Senator Paul said that the company’s close ties to China, where it derives the majority of its sales, merit a closer look.Investors have been bearish on CA’s shares since the deal was announced earlier this year. About 25 million shares of the New York-based software maker have been borrowed and sold short -- a little over 8 percent of the company’s float -- according to research firm S3 Partners.(Updates with share prices in sixth paragraph.)--With assistance from Matt Robinson.To contact the reporters on this story: Ed Hammond in New York at ehammond12@bloomberg.net;Christian Berthelsen in New York at cberthelsen1@bloomberg.net;Neil Weinberg in New York at nweinberg2@bloomberg.net;David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeffrey D Grocott at jgrocott2@bloomberg.net, Jillian WardFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2018 Bloomberg L.P.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck (MRK), McDonald's (MCD) and Broadcom (AVGO). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Merck’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year, losing -17.5% versus a gain of +8.4%. The Zacks analyst thinks Merck’s new products like Keytruda, Lynparza, and Bridion should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line in 2018. Keytruda sales are gaining strong momentum with approval for additional indications especially in the first-line lung cancer setting as it is the only anti-PD-1 approved in this setting. Animal Health unit is also strong and remains a core growth driver for Merck. Meanwhile, Merck will continue to focus on cost-cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line. However, generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to be overhangs on the top line. Rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and on products like Isentress (HIV), Zepatier (HCV) and Zostavax (vaccine) will remain headwinds in 2018.(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>).Shares of McDonald's have gained +18% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Restaurants industry which has gained +11.6% over the same period. Notably, growing guest count remains McDonald’s top priority and it is undertaking various sales and digital initiatives to this end. As a result, Q4 marked the fourth consecutive quarter of comparable guest count growth for the company. Increased focus on delivery, enhancement of digital capabilities, and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States will drive growth. In fact, global comps at McDonald’s have been positive over the past nine quarters. Meanwhile, augmented focus on refranchising will cut the company’s capital requirements and facilitate EPS growth and ROE expansion in the long run. Yet, higher costs along with currency headwinds may hurt profits. Also, a soft industry backdrop in the United States and macroeconomic concerns in some parts of the world might limit sales growth.(You can read the full research report on McDonald's here >>>).Broadcom’s shares have handily beaten the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the past year, gaining +14.3% vs. +11.2%. Broadcom is benefiting from strong demand of its wireless solutions and expanding product portfolio, which makes it well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like IoT and 5G. Broadcom has recently inked financing agreements with various institutions to fund Qualcomm’s proposed takeover. If completed, then this deal will make it the third-largest chipmaker, behind Intel and Samsung. The company also has strong ties with leading OEMs across multiple target markets that will help it to gain key insights into the requirements of customers. Moreover, the upcoming launch of the next generation WiFi products is expected to be a growth driver for the segment. However, customer concentration, intensifying competition, integration risks due to frequent acquisitions and leverage balance sheet are key headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Activision (ATVI), Rockwell Collins (COL) and Marvell Technology (MRVL).Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

Loss in fixed line voice businesses and prepaid segment continue to hurt.

On May 09, 2018, the Company announced that it has signed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) with VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE: VICI) (""VICI""). The LOI is with regards to the sale of two real estate properties owned by Caesars to VICI, as well as modifying the terms of certain lease agreements previously signed between the two Companies. These transactions are expected to strengthen the relationship between the two Companies and demonstrate their support for each other's growth.

This morning, Caesars Entertainment and VICI Properties most recent news is on our radar and our team decided to put out a fantastic report on the company that is now available for free below:www.active-investors.com/registration-sg/?symbol=CZR www.active-investors.com/registration-sg/?symbol=VICITransaction DetailsAccording to the LOI, Caesars will sell two properties - Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace, and the real estate assets associated with Harrah's Philadelphia, to VICI. VICI will pay a total of $749 million for these properties - $507.5 million for Octavius Tower and $241.5 million for the real estate assets of Harrah's Philadelphia. However, the total amount will be reduced by $159 million due to the impact of changes in the lease agreements between the two Companies. As per the terms of the lease agreement, Caesars will continue to operate both properties.The asset sale is subject to the signing of a definitive agreement between the two Companies, receipt of regulatory and third-party approvals, as well as other closing conditions.Modifications in Lease AgreementsDue to the sale of assets by Caesars to VICI, the LOI provides that both Caesars and VICI modify the terms of the existing Caesars Palace Las Vegas (CPLV) and other domestic property lease agreements (Non-CPLV). The modified terms also include:Addition of base rent escalation of 1.5% per year for years two through five of the Non-CPLV lease;Addition of minimum rent coverage ratios that would impact the base rent increases paid by Caesars to VICI;Reduction in variable rent adjustments from 13% and 19.5% to 4% of revenue growth over the relevant periods.These changes are aimed to align the lease agreements between Caesars and VICI with market precedents and the long-term performance of the properties. For VICI, these changes translate to the addition of real estate assets plus near-term increases in rent; whereas for Caesars, these changes will moderate the long-term rent payments and potential significant volatility in Caesars' rent payments to VICI. The assets sale and modifications in lease terms will help Caesars to pursue its development plans for the East Side of the Las Vegas Strip by overcoming the hurdles associated with those plans.Details of Assets Sale and Lease AgreementThe assets sold by Caesars includes The Octavius Tower and the Harrah's Philadelphia. The Octavius Tower is located on the Flamingo Avenue side of Caesars Palace Las Vegas. This 23-storey building was built in 2012 and has a total of 1.2 million square feet of space with 668 hotel rooms. Once the sale is complete, Caesars will lease the real estate related to The Octavius Tower from VICI under the modified CPLV lease agreement, and will pay an annual lease of $35 million for this property.The second asset sold is Harrah's Philadelphia, which is located along the waterfront in Chester, Pennsylvania. The property was built in 2006 and completed renovations in 2017. The property has 2 million square feet of space and includes 2,450 slot machines, live table games, several bars and restaurants, and parking garages. Once the sale is completed, Caesars will lease the real estate related to Harrah's Philadelphia from VICI under the Non-CPLV lease agreement. Caesars will initially make an annual lease payment of $21 million in the first year for this property and later the lease amount will be subject to contractual annual increase as per the modified terms of the Non-CPLV Lease.Both Companies plan to sign a definitive agreement within the next few weeks and expect to complete the transactions in phases by the fall of 2018, subject to satisfactory fulfilment of all conditions.Management CommentsCommenting on the signing of the LOI with VICI, Mark Frissora, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Caesars, said:""The planned lease amendments and asset sales will allow us to create more value for shareholders through growth initiatives and additional investment opportunities in our core businesses.""Edward Pitoniak, CEO of VICI, stated:""Octavius Tower will strengthen our footprint on the Las Vegas Strip; Harrah's Philadelphia will bolster our presence on the East Coast by establishing a foothold in a top gaming market; all while we add $56 million of NOI to our portfolio at an attractive net cap rate. Moreover, our mutually beneficial relationship and shared interests with Caesars will make the modifications of the lease terms possible.""About VICI PropertiesLas Vegas, Nevada-based VICI is an experiential real estate investment trust (REIT).

This will be part of the company’s Global Biscuits and Snacks segment including the Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s and Kelsen businesses.In order to attain cost synergies and revenue opportunities better, management will integrate with the Pepperidge Farm, which together will form Campbell Snacks, a unified snacking firm in the United States. This acquisition is likely to aid Campbell in fortifying its snacking brands’ portfolio, thus making it a snacking leader.As part of Campbell’s strategic plan, this buyout creates a $10-billion entity with roughly 50% of the company’s annual net sales in the faster-growing snacks unit. Notably, the addition of Snyder’s-Lance is anticipated to realize nearly $170 million as cost synergies by the end of fiscal 2022. Further, the integration is expected to generate about $125 million from Snyder’s-Lance’s current cost-transformation program.The combined snacking portfolio is likely to offer a broad range of exclusive better-for-you snacks comprising certain recognized brands like Goldfish, Milano, Snyder’s of Hanover, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, Lance, Cape Cod, Kettle Brand, KETTLE chips, Emerald and Late July.Additionally, Campbell has made a systematic way for both companies to rapidly adopt the major learnings and practices. The buyer will also unite the key control objectives together with supply chain and quality as well as finance.With the Snyder’s-Lance consolidation, management brought to effect some leadership changes to effectively manage the newly-formed Campbell Snacks unit and also to focus on the optimization of its U.S. snacks business. Those at the company’s helm are likely to concentrate on innovation and brand building across snacks business, end-to-end manufacturing quality, value capture and acceleration of business strategy among others.In fiscal 2017, Campbell's global baked snacks product unit, consisting of Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s and Kelsen businesses, grossed nearly $2.5 billion as net sales. Following the accretion of Snyder’s-Lance, snacking is likely to contribute about 47% to the company’s overall net sales annually as compared to the 32%, logged earlier. Further, the company’s soup portfolio will contribute roughly 26% to net sales in a year. Snyder’s-Lance generated net sales of $2.2 billion in 2017.Campbell has long been making acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio and expedite business growth. Prior to the aforesaid buyout, the company acquired a leading organic broth and soup producer named Pacific Foods, in a drive to widen its foothold in the fast-growing organic food space. Some other notable acquisitions are Garden Fresh Gourmet, Bolthouse Farms, the organic baby-food firm, Plum and the biscuit firm, Kelsen. Stock PerformanceFollowing the buyout news, shares of the Camden-based company did not swing much.

(NASDAQ: AAPL)'s valuation, Campbell Soup Company (NYSE: CPB) deciding to only sell some of its business units, and perhaps less pressing -- why he doesn't Tweet.Apple: A 10% Drop Is GoodBuffett told CNBC's Becky Quick he started buying Apple's stock when it was around $100 per share and added to his position ""a whole lot higher.""Like all investors, Buffett said he would prefer paying less for a stock and would welcome a 10-percent drop in Apple's stock. This would mean the company itself can repurchase a greater number of shares as part of its large stock buyback program. In return, investor ownership in Apple by default rises as the share count shrinks.Campbell Won't Find A Buyer In BuffettCampbell is under activist investor pressure to sell its business. Buffett has been involved in multiple food and consumer packaged deals over the years, but he said he ""certainly wouldn't be"" interested in buying Campbell.Part of the reason is attributed to owning a stake in a rival food company, Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC). However, it's difficult for a packaged goods company like Campbell to sell itself at an acceptable premium that also makes financial sense for the buyer.""The packaged goods business makes high returns on tangible assets that it has, but it is a tougher business than it was 10 years ago and the stocks are higher than they were 10 years ago,"" Buffett said.Better Things To Do Than TweetWhen asked about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's penchant for Tweeting, Buffett said, ""I don't think it's helped him a lot.""Buffett doesn't use Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) since there's no need to share his day-to-day views, he told Quick.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Micron MU.Here is a synopsis of all three stocks:Bull of the Day:Salesforce has seen its stock price jump over 12% in the last three months as the firm continues to bolster its cloud-based customer relationship management offerings. Looking ahead, Salesforce’s top and bottom line growth is something investors might not want to miss.Overview & Recent NewsSalesforce operates within the quickly growing customer relationship management industry that looks poised to become even popular as more businesses adapt to a nearly completely digital age. The company currently boasts over 150,000 business clients, including giants such as Adidas and U.S. Bancorp, offering them a wide range of services that would otherwise require a ton of in-house computing power, technological infrastructure, and maintenance.   Last quarter, Salesforce saw its revenues soar roughly 27% to reach $3.28 billion. The San Francisco-based firm recently announced that it upgraded its Financial Services Cloud to help companies offer a more unified customer experience. Salesforce also launched Quip Slides—an interactive slide presentation tool—to help it better compete against the likes of Microsoft and Google.Salesforce purchased Quip roughly two years ago, which helped the company roll out Microsoft Office-like products designed for the cloud from word processing to spreadsheets. Plus, the company announced on Thursday a new wrinkle to its Einstein artificial intelligence system called Einstein Voice. The service will allow users to conversationally update tasks on Salesforce, receive audible briefings, explore Salesforce’s dashboard, and more.The move highlights the prevalence of voice assistants from Amazon’s Alexa to Apple’s Siri. “We're in the midst of an incredible technological shift, where the power of voice is fundamentally changing the way we work,"" Salesforce Co-Founder and CTO Parker Harris said in a company statement. “Einstein Voice will usher in a new era of conversational CRM, delivering new levels of productivity and redefining customer experiences with voice technology.”Bear of the Day:Campbell Soup Company shares have plummeted roughly 21% over the last three years as the packaged food firm tries to navigate shifting consumer habits and the proliferation of healthier upstart options. Overview Campbell reported its Q4 and full-year financial results at the end of August and it wasn’t pretty. The firm’s fourth-quarter sales dipped 3% from the year-ago period, excluding a 36-point benefit from its recent acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods. Campbell’s organic full-year revenues slipped 2%.These recent acquisitions were made to help the company try to compete in a more diverse market, geared toward fresh and healthy options. Meanwhile, Campbell’s Q4 marketing and selling expenses soared 29% as it tried to incorporate its new brands. Now, Campbell hopes to sell its international and refrigerated-foods businesses, which include Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh, and Kelsen brands, among others.Campbell’s is not alone, Coca-Cola is set to purchase UK coffee giant Costa for $5.1 billion as it tries to expand its portfolio beyond sugary drinks. However, Campbell’s latest effort, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal and later confirmed by the company, will see it somewhat abandon its plans to offer healthier options. The company also reportedly remains open to an outright sale.Price Movement The last three years have not been kind to Campbell stock. Shares of CPB have fallen over 21% in the last 36 months, which looks even worse compared to the S&P 500’s nearly 50% jump. Campbell’s woes have continued despite a brief June jump. In fact, shares of CPB are down over 16% since the start of the year. But investors will notice that its industry hasn’t performed well either and is down over 7% during this same period.Additional content:Micron (MU) Beats on Top & Bottom Lines, Shares UpAmerican memory and storage tech firm Micron has released fiscal Q4 2018 (ended August) earnings after Thursday's closing bell, with typically positive results: earnings of $3.53 per share easily beat the Zacks consensus of $3.32, with year-over-year earnings growth up 75%. Quarterly sales posted $8.44 billion, which is not only well above the estimated $8.25 billion but even higher than the top on the previously guided revenue range of $8.4 billion.Gross margins in the quarter reached 61%, near the top of that guidance range. In terms of earnings results, this marks the 13th straight positive surprise -- you need to go back to fiscal Q3 2015 for the last time Micron missed expectations. After hours, MU shares are trading up 2+%.However, the stock is still down more than 20% since this past spring, and part of this has to do with NAND and DRAM businesses -- at which Micron excels -- is losing steam. So while Micron itself is bringing in 50% more revenues from the year-ago quarter, investors don't currently have much faith in the company's overall business environment. Prior to its earnings report, Micron carried a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with a Zacks Style Score (Value - Growth - Momentum) of A. For more on MU's earnings, click here.The company's conference call, scheduled to get underway a few minutes from now, will be crucial to the fortunes of this stock going forward. Guidance will play a critical role in where Micron -- an its sub-industries -- can be expected to go from here. Right now, the company estimates $2.88 per share for its November (Q1 2019) quarter, and $8.35 billion on the top line.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>Get today’s Zacks #1 Stock of the Day with your free subscription to Profit from the Pros newsletter:About the Bull and Bear of the DayEvery day, the analysts at Zacks Equity Research select two stocks that are likely to outperform (Bull) or underperform (Bear) the markets over the next 3-6 months.About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous analyst coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

Las ventas que planea dejarán a Campbell Soup con marcas que incluyen Goldfish, Pepperidge Farm y Snyder's of Hanover.La empresa anunció una reorganización en mayo, junto con el retiro de la directora general Denise Morrison, mientras la compañía enfrenta una mezcla de cambios en las tendencias alimentarias y aranceles potencialmente costosos en el acero y aluminio.Campbell's ha estado batallado con un declive en las ventas de sopas y jugos en un mercado atestado de competidores, al mismo tiempo que muchas familias buscan productos que consideran más sanos y menos procesados.A principios de este año, el secretario estadounidense de Comercio, Wilbur Ross, sostuvo una lata de sopa Campbell's en una entrevista con CNBC para asegurar que los aranceles del gobierno de Donald Trump al acero y aluminio ""no eran la gran cosa"". La empresa prevé, sin embargo, que aumentarán los costos del acero y aluminio, elevando sus gastos en general.Por otra parte, sus ganancias del cuarto trimestre cayeron 70% a 94 millones de dólares, 31 centavos de dólar por acción, debido a que el aumento en los gastos superó un incremento en los ingresos.

His net worth, including current equity holdings, is about $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The stock has returned more than 2,200 percent since its 1994 initial public offering, including reinvested dividends, compared with about 650 percent for the S&P 500 Financials Index.Capital One, the third-biggest U.S. credit-card lender, stands to benefit along with competitors including Discover Financial Services as President Donald Trump eased financial regulations and signed legislation that cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.“The best is yet to come” for U.S. banks, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients last month. “There is the potential for the industry to experience higher profitability and earnings growth against a backdrop of improved economic conditions, continued strong credit quality, a more constructive regulatory environment and further increases in interest rates.”Fairbank is the fourth U.S. bank CEO to be identified as a billionaire by the Bloomberg index, joining JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Lloyd Blankfein and M&T Bancorp’s Bob Wilmers, who died last month.Shares of Capital One rose 1.9 percent this year through Thursday, to a record $101.42, fueled by a stronger economic outlook and corporate tax cuts.Fairbank and Nigel Morris, his colleague at a Washington-area consulting firm, started tinkering with new ways of parsing data to assess credit-card risk in the 1980s. They were hired in 1988 by Signet Bank, where they pioneered concepts such as tailored interest rates and created offers that enticed borrowers to transfer balances from other cards.The business prospered and Signet spun off Capital One in the 1994 IPO, making Fairbank CEO. The company, based in McLean, Virginia, is now the seventh-biggest commercial bank by assets in the U.S. The firm also targets subprime borrowers, a fee-rich business that helped Fairbank double annual profit since 2005 to $3.75 billion in 2016.While Fairbank doesn’t collect a salary, over the past three years he has averaged more than $18 million in cash bonuses and stock and options awards from Capital One, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. He declined to comment through a company spokeswoman.Fairbank, a father of eight, is one of about a dozen minority owners of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, the group that owns five sports teams including the National Hockey League’s Washington Capitals, the Washington Wizards of the National Basketball Association, as well as the Capital One Arena, where both teams play.Capital One has been a prolific advertiser, pouring $13 billion into marketing since 2008, featuring celebrities including Jennifer Garner, Spike Lee, Charles Barkley, Alec Baldwin and Samuel L.

Finneran, Jr., Capital One. Photo credit: Bloomberg News. [/caption] Capital One Financial Corp. has named Matthew Cooper, 46, who has been chief counsel and functional head of its legal department for the past two years, as its new general counsel effective Feb. 1. Cooper replaces John Finneran, 67, who will become interim chief risk officer at the McLean, Virginia-based company from Feb. 1 to Aug. 1, according to a company filing Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Neither Cooper nor Finneran were immediately available for comment. The filing describes a round of musical chairs. On Aug. 1, Finneran will become senior adviser to chairman and CEO Richard Fairbank, as well as to the company’s executive team and board of directors. Finneran remains the company's corporate secretary and will be responsible for all corporate governance processes. Finneran will replace chief risk officer Kevin Borgmann, who has held the job since January 2013. Borgmann also is becoming a senior adviser to Fairbank on Feb. 1. The change of jobs was requested by Borgmann, the company said in the filing. Finneran will be replaced as CRO on Aug. 1 by Sheldon Hall, 41, a business development banker for Capital One. Hall joined the company in 1997 and has held roles of increasing responsibility across the company, including president of Capital One Auto Finance. The new GC, Cooper, joined the company in January 2009. He leads a department of 350 attorneys and legal professionals. He previously served two years as executive vice president for legal, overseeing about half the legal department; and three years as chief litigation counsel. Prior to joining Capital One, Cooper held various executive positions in the legal department of General Electric Co., as well as deputy general counsel of one of its successor companies, Genworth Financial. He also spent four years in private practice, including 10 months in commercial litigation at McGuire Woods, and over three years at Bradley Arant Boult Cummings. At Capital One, Cooper will head a legal department dealing with at least four major litigation matters cited by the company in its latest quarterly financial report to the SEC filed in November. They include:Capital One is under investigation by the New York District Attorney’s Office, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury for possible money laundering violations. The company is cooperating with all agencies in the investigation. In addition, Capital One already is subject to an open consent order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency dated July 10, 2015, related to regulatory deficiencies in its anti-money laundering program.A long running antitrust class action suit against several banks, MasterCard and Visa alleging that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. Any damages could be trebled. The suit is pending in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn.A complex lawsuit filed in 2009 in New York County Supreme Court against a now closed subsidiary, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc. Three original plaintiffs alleged that GreenPoint breached representations and warranties related to its sale of a portfolio of 30,000 mortgages worth about $1.8 billion. Two plaintiffs were dismissed, and U.S. Bank remains the sole plaintiff in the case.In 2012 the Federal Housing Finance Agency filed three summonses with notice in New York State court against GreenPoint, on behalf of trustees for three RMBS trusts backed by loans originated by GreenPoint. The loans have an aggregate original principal balance of $3.4 billion. The suit alleged breaches of contractual representations and warranties regarding compliance with GreenPoint underwriting guidelines on loans. Last March the trial court dismissed the claims as untimely, but in May the plaintiff appealed.On all litigation matters, the filing stated that management estimated “the reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserves as of September 30, 2017, is approximately $250 million. There is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results.”Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Today, the Dow is trading at 25,837.46 and the S&P 500 is trading at 2,857.05.What Else Was Going On In The World?In 1998, Exxon and Mobil merged to form the world’s largest petroleum company, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM). The U.S. introduced new $20 bills with features to combat counterfeiters. Average monthly rent was $619.Long Term Capital Management's DownfallLTCM was founded in 1993 by former Salomon Brothers bond trader John Meriwether. Meriwether started LTCM with about $1 billion in assets under management and focused his efforts on arbitrage trading in the bond market. LTCM also focused on interest rate swaps, a strategy that involves trading one series of future interest rate payments for another, such as swapping fixed-rate interest payments for floating rate payments or vice versa.By 1998, LTCM had grown its assets to around $5 billion, but the financial crisis in Russia would soon trigger its collapse. Due to the company’s extreme leverage, LTCM was unable to unload its massive positions when the value of the ruble tanked. On Aug. 21, 1998, LTCM suffered more than $500 million in losses in a single day.About a month later, LTCM would file for bankruptcy.Related Links:This Day In Market History: 1980s Bull Market BeginsA Concerning Weakness In Bank StocksSee more from BenzingaBrokerage Stocks Crushed As JPMorgan Rolls Out Digital Service With Free TradesThe Eagles' 'Greatest Hits' Supplants 'Thriller' As The Top-Selling Album Of All Time...AgainEarnings Show That As Macy's And Walmart Go, So Goes Retail© 2018 Benzinga.com.

Besides launching and managing equity mutual funds, this Toronto, Canada based firm is also known for producing extremely good risk-adjusted returns. Its Portfolio Manager and Co-Chief Executive Officer Bradley Dunkley gained his experience while working for Gluskin Sheff + Associates Inc. for more than a decade, after joining in 1998. Until January 2010, he served as a Senior Portfolio Manager, Portfolio Manager of Canadian Equities & Income Trusts and Portfolio Manager of Proprietary Hedge Funds and a Vice President.

Apparently, the combination of its risk management program and intensive research-driven stock selection is a winning one since the firm records more positive than negative years when it comes to market returns.For instance, its Waratah Performance fund, one of its three core funds, has been recording the positive returns over the years. In 2013 the fund returned 22.37% which was the biggest return in the last five years. In 2014 and 2015, the fund returned 7.39% and 2.09%, respectively. Then, in 2016, the fund tripled its 2015 return to 7.15%, followed by 13.74% in 2017. Finally, according to the data from January to October 29th, 2018 the fund returned 3.25%. Waratah Performance had a total return of 127.93%, and a compound annual return of 10.05%. Its worst drawdown was 13.22.When it comes to its other fund, Waratah One, some minor fluctuations were recorded. In 2013, the fund returned 10.85%, followed by 5.97% in 2014. In the next three years, there haven’t been major fluctuations with returned 3.69%, 4.31%, and 3.85%, respectively. This year, at least according to the data retrieved on October 29th, is a down year for Waratah One, since it lost 1.41%. Waratah One had a total return of 54.05%, and a compound annual return of 5.38%. Its worst drawdown was 4.72. As of March 2017, Waratah Capital Advisors manages $1.2 billion in assets and over $2.1 billion in capital deployed.Insider Monkey’s flagship strategy identifies the best performing 100 hedge funds at the end of each quarter and invests in their consensus stock picks.

He holds a B.S. summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Yale University with Distinction in Economics and Applied Mathematics (focus in Finance).Element Capital Management utilizes a modern macro style of global macro investing, meaning it has a multi-process investment approach that combines many important forms of macro analysis. The fund’s investment team relies on its “proprietary base of technology, disciplined risk management, innovative trade structuring and advanced portfolio construction techniques to implement its strategies”. Its investment philosophy has proven to be very smart, as the fund delivered returns of more than 19% in three of the last four years. When many other hedge funds were struggling through 2016 with average returns of 2.3%, Element Capital brought back 19.4%. In 2015, which was even worse for the average macro-oriented fund (which lost 1.2%), Element Capital Management gained 23%. 2017 was also a good year for the fund, as it returned 5.46% to give it average returns of 15.61% between 2015 and 2017, placing it 23rd on Barron’s 2018 list of the top 100 Hedge Funds. In the first nine months of 2018, the fund gained an impressive 25%. According to its plain brochure, at the end of December 2016, Element Capital Management had around $55.88 billion of regulatory assets under management on a discretionary basis on behalf of the Element Funds.Insider Monkey’s flagship strategy identifies the best performing 100 hedge funds at the end of each quarter and invests in their consensus stock picks. This way it is always invested in the best ideas of the best performing hedge funds and is able to generate much higher returns than the market. Since its inception in May 2014, our flagship strategy generated a cumulative return of 96.9%, beating the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by over 40 percentage points (see the details here).During the third-quarter, Element Capital Management made many changes to its large equity portfolio, which includes several of the 25 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds in 2018, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which now tops that list after displacing Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). You can read about those changes on the next page.On September 30, Element Capital Management reported its largest stake as being in New York-based investment company, Altaba Inc (NASDAQ:AABA). During the quarter, the fund actually reduced its position in it by 28% to 15.78 million shares worth around $1.08 billion. The second-largest position owned by the fund was in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), counting 713,445 shares valued at $81.6 million, after raising its stake by 196% in Q3.Among the greatest additions to the fund’s 13F portfolio were Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC), in which it acquired 2.41 million shares worth around $132.95 million, and First Hawaiian Inc (NASDAQ:FHB), 2.76 million shares of which the fund obtained during the third quarter.As for the companies in which Granite Point Capital seemed to lose faith, deciding to dump its positions, those counted Kroger Co (NYSE:KR), in which it previously held 2.44 million shares worth around $69.34 million, and Macerich Co (NYSE:MAC), in which it had previously owned 343,614 shares worth around $19.53 million.Disclosure: None Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.AI investing is incredibly broad, but a few companies will be huge winners.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

These filings show these funds' portfolio positions as of June 30. In this article we are going to take a look at smart money sentiment towards Appian Corporation (NASDAQ:APPN). Appian Corporation (NASDAQ:APPN) shares haven't seen a lot of action during the fourth quarter. Overall, hedge fund sentiment was unchanged. The stock was only in 4 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of June, but one of these hedge funds, Abdiel Capital, was extremely bullish about this stock. The level and the change in hedge fund popularity aren't the only variables you need to analyze to decipher hedge funds' perspectives. A stock may witness a boost in popularity but it may still be less popular than similarly priced stocks. That's why at the end of this article we will examine companies such as Alamos Gold Inc (NYSE:AGI), Trustmark Corp (NASDAQ:TRMK), and Liberty Oilfield Services Inc. (NYSE:LBRT) to gather more data points. [caption id=""attachment_670343"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""473""]Colin Moran Abdiel Capital[/caption] In the financial world there are a large number of tools investors have at their disposal to grade stocks. A pair of the most under-the-radar tools are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the best fund managers can outperform the broader indices by a solid amount. Insider Monkey's flagship best performing hedge funds strategy returned 17.4% year to date and outperformed the market by more than 14 percentage points this year. This strategy also outperformed the market by 3 percentage points in the fourth quarter despite the market volatility (see the details here). That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is a useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. Let's analyze the recent hedge fund action surrounding Appian Corporation (NASDAQ:APPN).Heading into the fourth quarter of 2018, a total of 4 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of 0% from the previous quarter. Below, you can check out the change in hedge fund sentiment towards APPN over the last 6 quarters. With hedge funds' capital changing hands, there exists a few noteworthy hedge fund managers who were boosting their holdings substantially (or already accumulated large positions).Of the funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Colin Moran's Abdiel Capital Advisors has the number one position in Appian Corporation (NASDAQ:APPN), worth close to $208.5 million, comprising 17.5% of its total 13F portfolio. In recent regulatory filings Abdiel Capital revealed increasing its position to nearly 6.9 million shares from 5.8 million shares at the end of June. Abdiel's most recent purchase was on Thursday, a purchase of 1200 shares at a price of $25 per share. On Abdiel Capital Advisors's heels is D E Shaw, led by D. E. Shaw, holding a $4.9 million position; less than 0.1%% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the company. Other peers with similar optimism encompass Phil Frohlich's Prescott Group Capital Management, Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management and . Judging by the fact that Appian Corporation (NASDAQ:APPN) has faced declining sentiment from the smart money, logic holds that there exists a select few funds that decided to sell off their entire stakes last quarter. At the top of the heap, Brian Ashford-Russell and Tim Woolley's Polar Capital dumped the biggest investment of all the hedgies monitored by Insider Monkey, valued at an estimated $3.3 million in stock, and David Atterbury's Whetstone Capital Advisors was right behind this move, as the fund cut about $2.2 million worth. These bearish behaviors are interesting, as total hedge fund interest stayed the same (this is a bearish signal in our experience). Let's go over hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Appian Corporation (NASDAQ:APPN). We will take a look at Alamos Gold Inc (NYSE:AGI), Trustmark Corp (NASDAQ:TRMK), Liberty Oilfield Services Inc. (NYSE:LBRT), and Avaya Holdings Corp. (NYSE:AVYA). This group of stocks' market caps are closest to APPN's market cap. [table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position AGI,12,84403,2 TRMK,10,33753,2 LBRT,7,141211,-5 AVYA,34,509275,-1 [/table] As you can see these stocks had an average of 15.75 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $192 million. That figure was $214 million in APPN's case. Avaya Holdings Corp. (NYSE:AVYA) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Liberty Oilfield Services Inc. (NYSE:LBRT) is the least popular one with only 7 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Appian Corporation (NASDAQ:APPN) is even less popular than LBRT. Considering that hedge funds other than Abdiel aren't fond of this stock in relation to other companies analyzed in this article, it may be a good idea to analyze it in detail and understand why the smart money isn't behind this stock. This isn't necessarily bad news. Abdiel Capital is actually one of the best performing hedge funds during Q2. We usually recommend investors to take a look at the 25 most popular stocks among hedge funds for investment ideas but in this case we are going to make an exception and ask our readers to take a closer look at Appian. The company has more than $100 million in cash which it uses to invest in growth. Its subscription revenue is growing at a health ~40% rate. The stock lost a third of its value in the last couple of months due to market volatility and concerns about a rising interest rate environment. This may provide a good entry point for new investors.

This year, we have executives, developers and innovators from the likes of Facebook, Amazon, IBM, JP Morgan, Zelle, TD Ameritrade, TradeStation, Fidelity, and so many more.The BZ Awards is an oscar-like event to showcase those companies creating technology that is paving the way for the future of financial services and capital markets. In preparation for its biggest installment yet this May, we're profiling the companies that have moved to the final round of judging for the BZ Awards. In this feature we focus in on Capital Market Laboratories.What does your company do? What unique problem does it solve? We break the information asymmetry that has benefited the top 0.1 percent of investors and the mega institutions at the expense of the rest for far too long. yes they know more than retail knows. Yes they use it to profit. Yes, we are breaking it.Capital Market Laboratories is a member of Thomson First Call Institutional research. While our research sits side-by-side with Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan. Morgan Stanley, and the rest, we are the anti-institution and make our research and tools available to everyone. While others are paying $2000/mo for their terminals and another large fee for add-ons, we make our institutional tools available to retail investors.Who are your customers? Mostly retail traders, some of whom used to be professionals and have moved on. We do have some institutional users as well.How long have you been in business?4 yearsWhere are you located?Los Angeles, CAWho is your company's leadership? What kind of experience do they have? None of this is possible without a team that has an institutional background, peer reviewed machine earning and finance papers, and massive reach into the guts of finance and its history. Here are our three key members (of course the team is larger). This is worth the read:Ophir Gottlieb (CEO & Co-founder) — Ophir Gottlieb is the CEO & Co-founder of Capital Market Laboratories. He contributes to Yahoo! Finance, CNNMoney,MarketWatch, Business Insider, and Reuters. He was rated the 14th best finance follow on all of Twitter.He has turned away from institutional finance and re-dedicated his life to helping all people find the capacity and facility to invest with the same confidence and information available to only the top 0.1 percent. In many ways, Ophir was unintentionally a part of this asymmetry, but now, he is here to tear it down.Ophir Gottlieb is inventor of the Forensic Alpha Model (FAM) and a co-inventor of Accounting and Governance Risk Model (AGR), both now owned commercially by MSCI. SSRN lists his peer reviewed research published in the Rotman International Journal of Finance, and as far as we can tell, he was one of the earliest scientists to identify deep learning, and in particular, neural networks, as a novel approach to examining financial markets while also whole hardheartedly incorporating corporate governance.Mr. Gottlieb’s methodological approach taken in creating FAM was endorsed by the head of artificial intelligence for the state of Germany as a novel and extraordinary application of advanced machine learning and quantitative finance.FAM and AGR are used by asset managers worldwide with over $1 trillion of assets under management. The FAM model has made Mr. Gottlieb one of the most recognized names in all of quantitative finance.The Huffington Post dedicated an article to Ophir’s views in the dossier Financial Services Third Wave of Innovation: AI & Machine Learning. A rare view into his vision of the world of finance, including a 20 minute video session.Mr Gottlieb’s mathematics, measure theory and machine learning background stems from his graduate work in mathematics and measure theory at Stanford University and his time as an option market maker on the NYSE and CBOE exchange floors. He has been cited by various financial media over 500 times including Reuters, Bloomberg, Wall St. Journal, Dow Jones Newswire and through re-publications in Barron’s, Forbes, SF Chronicle, Chicago Tribune and Miami Herald. Now he is often seen on financial television around the world.Mr. Gottlieb was an option maker on the NYSE ARCA exchange floor and simultaneously on the Chicago Board Option Exchange (CBOE) remotely. He first gained notoriety as the managing director of client services and algorithmic trading for Livevol Inc, recently acquired by CBOE. He created and authored what was believed to be the most widely followed option trading blog in the world for three-years that was consumed as real-time news on Bloomberg terminals.James A. Kaplan (Chairman & Co-founder) — Mr. Kaplan is a founding director of MarketWatch, and is widely recognized as one of the grandfather’s of modern portfolio theory.For the past 20 years, James Kaplan’s research interests and entrepreneurial ventures have focused on innovations designed to improve the predictive and explanatory power of classical finance theories and portfolio management philosophies. Before he co-founded CML, Mr. Kaplan as Vice Chairman and Chief Executive of GMI Ratings (now part of MSCI). In this role, Mr. Kaplan developed novel risk modeling methodologies to help capital market participants mitigate the impact of what he has dubbed “routine anomalies”. The term refers to high-impact events stemming from variables typically overlooked in classical economic theories.Earlier in his career, Mr. Kaplan has advanced groundbreaking applications of quantitative techniques and technology-driven solutions for equity and fixed-income portfolio analytics. In 1979, he founded Capital Management Sciences (CMS) and established the firm as the world’s top purveyor of fixed income portfolio analytics. During his tenure, the firm introduced CMS BondEdge, the chief independent source of research and valuation tools for the global bond market.Following the sale of CMS to Interactive Data Corporation, Mr. Kaplan was a founding director of MarketWatch. In the wake of the notorious corporate scandals after 2000, he founded Audit Integrity, one of the three firms that merged to form GMI Ratings. Mr. Kaplan received his BA from the University of Colorado and an MBA from California State University. Mr. Kaplan is a Chartered Financial Analyst.Jason Hitchings (Chief Technology Officer) – Jason Hitchings is the Chief Technology Officer at CML. He has diverse background in software engineering, product development, data visualizations as well as numerical analysis and real-time algorithmic option pricing.He was the lead developer and product manager that led to one of the first ever SQL databases that updated asset prices in real-time; an accomplishment at the time that was considered by many in the industry to be impossible but is now commonplace in all of the exchanges and major banks in the world.Jason’s experience includes Head of Product at data visualization firm, Quid, the co-founder and lead engineer of financial analytics firm and broker-dealer, Livevol, Inc. Jason has also worked as the lead software engineer on Lockheed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter Autonomic Logistics team.Jason holds a computer science degree from University of Colorado, Boulder.Who are your investors, if any?James A.

It's founded by its portfolio managers Jay Petschek (pictured below) and Steven Major back in May 2002, and since then the fund manages client focused equity portfolios.Mr. Jay Petschek holds a B.A. in Applied Mathematics from Harvard College and an M.S. in Management from the Sloan School of Management, M.I.T. He has a vast professional experience in corporate finance which he gained while working in Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. for more than a decade. While there, he served as Director of the research department for two years, and also a Senior Managing Director. Prior to that, he worked at the corporate department at Bankers Trust Company as an Assistant Treasurer until 1984. Six years later he founded the predecessor to Corsair Capital Partners, L.P. He's a Director of Dab-O-Matic Corp., Recognition Media LLC, and Global Opportunity Partners Ltd. Also he was Director of Resource Recycling Technology Inc.After obtaining a B.A. in English at Yeshiva College in 1990, Mr. Steven Major worked in the Investment Banking Division of Goldman, Sachs & Co for two years, as an Analyst. In 1994 he received an MBA in Finance from Columbia Business School. At the time he was working at Oppenheimer & Co., where he also served as a vice president. While there he was focused on sell-side equity research covering a wide range of companies that had emerged from bankruptcy or a general restructuring process. Prior to co-founding Corsair Capital Management, Mr. Steven Major was a portfolio manager and a managing director in the Asset Management Department of Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. for five years.As an event-driven and value-oriented, long/short equity hedge fund, Corsair Capital Management builds its investment strategy around companies going through structural and (or) strategic change. In a process of determining potential companies worth investing in, the fund uses a selective approach and fundamental research while paying particular attention to potential disparities that might occur regarding a company's price and its intrinsic value. Being value investors, the fund's portfolio managers are guided by three principles when investing - staying ahead of inflation and the effect of taxes when increasing capital, retaining a diversified portfolio while taking wise risks and being aware that a good investment is both hard to find and needs time to get results. After all, investing is ""a marathon and not a series of consecutive sprints,"" as Corsair says in one of its investor letters. Besides investing in publicly - traded equity securities, its Private Funds invest in debt and hybrid securities, as well as in the securities of foreign issuers. As for other Corsair Capital funds, their portfolios are usually comprised of core positions in 20-30 companies and smaller positions in 50-100 companies, which are nothing else than near-term trading opportunities. As for its Corsair Select fund's portfolios, they are concentrated in the core positions of the Corsair Capital funds. In addition, Corsair Select's 2018 performance was a bit disappointing since the fund lost 4,.5% until late-June, according to the Corsair Capital Management's Q2 investor letter.In addition, this year hasn't been prosperous for its Corsair Capital Partners L.P. fund either, since the fund lost 0.89% through October 31. Moreover, the fund's returns went up and down several times over the last five years. The best return of 15.21% was recorded in 2013. However, in 2014 the fund returned only 4.45%. This falling trend continued in 2015 as well, when the fund lost 7.48%. Surprisingly, it has made a solid comeback returning 7.24% in 2016, and 12.53% in 2017, only to have another down year in 2018, as we already mentioned. Corsair Capital Partners L.P. had a total return of 2377.29%, a compound annual return of 12.26% and its worst drawdown was 25.66. As of March 2018, Corsair Capital Management had total discretionary assets under management of around $889.73 million. So, does it make sense to follow hedge funds like Corsair Capital? We’ve uncovered a reliable way to consistently beat the market by using these 13F filings and investing in only the top consensus picks of the 100 best performing hedge funds each quarter. Insider Monkey’s flagship “Best Performing Hedge Funds Strategy” has returned 78.4% since its 2014 inception (through December 3), beating the market by over 18 percentage points. Check out a detailed analysis of Insider Monkey’s performance and past quarterly stock picks for all the details. Our newest picks were released last month and outperforming the market by a large margin; don’t miss out!At the end of the third quarter, during which Corsair Capital Management added 3 new positions and dumped 8 companies, its 13F portfolio was valued at $435,07 million. Read about the most important portfolio changes the fund made as well as its biggest gainers and decliners during the third quarter of 2018 on the next page.As of September 30, the most substantial contributors to the fund's portfolio were Interactivecorp (NASDAQ:IAC), a New York-based holding company and owner of more than 150 brands worldwide, mostly in media and Internet, and Nort Carolina-based supplier of highly engineered products and technologies, SPX Corp (NYSE:SPXC). The fund owns 149,491 shares of Interactivecorp (NASDAQ:IAC) worth $32.39 million, after decreasing its stake in the company by 14%. The company also found its place among 25 Stocks Billionaires Are Piling On, while it's quite obvious that hedge funds are fond of its stock as well. Currently, the company is trading at price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 35.82 and it has a market cap of $14.85 billion. The closing price of the company's stock was $167.80 on December 26th (Wednesday). When it comes to SPX Corp (NYSE:SPXC) the situation isn't much different. The fund reduced its stake in the company by 5% to 801,716 shares valued at $26.7 million, accounting for 6.13% of the portfolio’s value. At the end of the third quarter, 11 smart money investors were long SPX Corp, up by one from the previous quarter.Among the biggest third-quarter additions to Corsair Capital Management was position in TiVo Corp (NASDAQ:TIVO) a San Jose, California- based technology company whose 97,959 shares the fund purchased for $1.22 million, accounting for 0.28% of the portfolio’s value. It's interesting to note that in its Q2 investor letter, the fund actually expressed doubts regarding investing in tech stocks. It's left to be seen what will be the fund's next move when it comes to this stock, knowing that Nasdaq 100 Index lost 8.7% in October, that way taking down stocks in the technology sector with it. On December 26th (Wednesday), TiVo Corp (NASDAQ:TIVO), closed at $8.75 in the latest trading session. Over the past three months, the company’s stock price has lost 37.27%. The company has a market cap of $1.16 billion. The fund was quite optimistic when it comes to Ryman Hospitality Properties Inc. (NYSE:RHP), a hotel, resort, media, and entertainment company, and Willscot Corp (NASDAQ:WSC), a warehousing and storage services company, since it significantly increased its stake in the companies by 230% and 97%, respectively. As of September 30th, the fund owns 155,211 shares of Ryman Hospitality Properties Inc. (NYSE:RHP) worth $13.37 million, and 697,067 shares of Willscot Corp (NASDAQ:WSC) valued at $11,95 million. At the end of Q3, 24 smart money investors were long Ryman Hospitality Properties Inc., up by seven from the previous quarter, while 26 hedge funds owned Willscot Corp shares, down from 31 in the second quarter.In the meantime, it seems that Corsair Capital Management lost faith in some of its other holdings. For instance, some of the biggest positions the fund decided to completely sell during the third quarter were in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Co (NASDAQ:HMHC) whose 142,865 shares the fund previously held and Natus Medical Inc (NASDAQ:BABY), to whose 45,905 shares the fund said goodbye to.Disclosure: None.

The stock currently pays out a dividend yield of 3.62%, and has a market cap of US$16.35B. Does Cardinal Health tick all the boxes of a great dividend stock? Below, I’ll take you through my analysis. See our latest analysis for Cardinal HealthIf you are a dividend investor, you should always assess these five key metrics:Does it pay an annual yield higher than 75% of dividend payers?Has it paid dividend every year without dramatically reducing payout in the past?Has dividend per share risen in the past couple of years?Does earnings amply cover its dividend payments?Will it have the ability to keep paying its dividends going forward?The company currently pays out 34.24% of its earnings as a dividend, according to its trailing twelve-month data, which means that the dividend is covered by earnings. Going forward, analysts expect CAH’s payout to remain around the same level at 33.97% of its earnings, which leads to a dividend yield of around 3.72%. In addition to this, EPS is forecasted to fall to $3.86 in the upcoming year. If there’s one type of stock you want to be reliable, it’s dividend stocks and their stable income-generating ability. CAH has increased its DPS from $0.56 to $1.91 in the past 10 years. During this period it has not missed a payment, as one would expect for a company increasing its dividend. These are all positive signs of a great, reliable dividend stock. Relative to peers, Cardinal Health produces a yield of 3.62%, which is high for Healthcare stocks but still below the market’s top dividend payers.Taking into account the dividend metrics, Cardinal Health ticks most of the boxes as a strong dividend investment, putting it in my list of top dividend payers. Given that this is purely a dividend analysis, you should always research extensively before deciding whether or not a stock is an appropriate investment for you. I always recommend analysing the company’s fundamentals and underlying business before making an investment decision. I’ve put together three fundamental factors you should further examine:Future Outlook: What are well-informed industry analysts predicting for CAH’s future growth? Take a look at our free research report of analyst consensus for CAH’s outlook.Valuation: What is CAH worth today? Even if the stock is a cash cow, it’s not worth an infinite price.

While this makes KMX appear like a stock to add to your portfolio, you might change your mind after gaining a better understanding of the assumptions behind the P/E ratio. In this article, I calculate CarMax's fair value using a comparable companies analysis.Comparable Companies AnalysisA Multiples Valuation, also known as a Comparable Companies Analysis, determines the value of a subject company by benchmarking the subject's financial performance against similar public companies (Peer Group). We can infer if a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to its peers by comparing metrics like growth, profit margin, and valuation multiples.A P/E Multiple is a valuation ratio that indicates the multiple of earnings investors are willing to pay for one share of a company:P/E Multiple = Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per ShareThe P/E ratio is not meant to be viewed in isolation and is only useful when comparing it to other similar companies. Since it is expected that similar companies have similar P/E ratios, we can come to some conclusions about the stock if the ratios are different. I compare CarMax's P/E multiple to those of AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN), Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE: PAG), Lithia Motors Inc (NYSE: LAD) and Sonic Automotive Inc (NYSE: SAH) in the chart below.source: finbox.io Benchmarks: P/E MultiplesSince CarMax's P/E of 16.3x is higher than the median of its peers (9.8x), it means that investors are paying more than they should for each dollar of KMX's earnings. As such, our analysis shows that KMX represents an overvalued stock. Furthermore, finbox.io's P/E Multiple Model calculates a fair value of $51.85 per share which implies -16.3% downside.Note that the selected multiple of 13.5x in the analysis above was determined by averaging CarMax's current P/E multiple with the highest multiple of its comparable companies (LAD - 10.7x).Understanding the P/E Ratio's LimitationsBefore jumping to the conclusion that CarMax should be banished from your portfolio, it is important to understand that our conclusion rests on two important assumptions.(1) the selected peer group actually contains companies that truly are similar to CarMax, and(2) the selected peer group stocks are being fairly valued by the market.If the first assumption is not accurate, the difference in P/E ratios could be due to a variety of factors. For example, if you accidentally compare CarMax with lower growth companies, then its P/E multiple would naturally be higher than its peers since investors reward high growth stocks with a higher price. However, CarMax's recent earnings growth has been middle of the road relative to its peers as shown below.source: P/E modelNow if the second assumption does not hold true, CarMax's higher multiple may be because firms in our peer group are being undervalued by the market.What This Means For InvestorsAs a shareholder, you may have already conducted fundamental analysis on the stock so its current overvaluation could signal a potential selling opportunity to reduce your exposure to KMX. However, keep in mind the limitations of the P/E ratio when making investment decisions. There are a variety of other fundamental factors that I have not taken into consideration in this article. If you have not done so already, I highly recommend that you complete your research on CarMax by taking a look at the following:Valuation Metrics: how much upside do shares of CarMax have based on Wall Street's consensus price target? Take a look at our analyst upside data explorer that compares the company's upside relative to its peers.Risk Metrics: what is CarMax's asset efficiency? This ratio measures the amount of cash flow that a company generates from its assets.

While this makes KMX appear like a stock to add to your portfolio, you might change your mind after gaining a better understanding of the assumptions behind the P/E ratio. In this article, I calculate CarMax's fair value using a comparable companies analysis.Comparable Companies AnalysisA Multiples Valuation, also known as a Comparable Companies Analysis, determines the value of a subject company by benchmarking the subject's financial performance against similar public companies (Peer Group). We can infer if a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to its peers by comparing metrics like growth, profit margin, and valuation multiples.A P/E Multiple is a valuation ratio that indicates the multiple of earnings investors are willing to pay for one share of a company:P/E Multiple = Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per ShareThe P/E ratio is not meant to be viewed in isolation and is only useful when comparing it to other similar companies. Since it is expected that similar companies have similar P/E ratios, we can come to some conclusions about the stock if the ratios are different. I compare CarMax's P/E multiple to those of AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN), Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE: PAG), Lithia Motors Inc (NYSE: LAD) and Sonic Automotive Inc (NYSE: SAH) in the chart below.source: finbox.io Benchmarks: P/E MultiplesSince CarMax's P/E of 16.3x is higher than the median of its peers (9.8x), it means that investors are paying more than they should for each dollar of KMX's earnings. As such, our analysis shows that KMX represents an overvalued stock. Furthermore, finbox.io's P/E Multiple Model calculates a fair value of $51.85 per share which implies -16.3% downside.Note that the selected multiple of 13.5x in the analysis above was determined by averaging CarMax's current P/E multiple with the highest multiple of its comparable companies (LAD - 10.7x).Understanding the P/E Ratio's LimitationsBefore jumping to the conclusion that CarMax should be banished from your portfolio, it is important to understand that our conclusion rests on two important assumptions.(1) the selected peer group actually contains companies that truly are similar to CarMax, and(2) the selected peer group stocks are being fairly valued by the market.If the first assumption is not accurate, the difference in P/E ratios could be due to a variety of factors. For example, if you accidentally compare CarMax with lower growth companies, then its P/E multiple would naturally be higher than its peers since investors reward high growth stocks with a higher price. However, CarMax's recent earnings growth has been middle of the road relative to its peers as shown below.source: P/E modelNow if the second assumption does not hold true, CarMax's higher multiple may be because firms in our peer group are being undervalued by the market.What This Means For InvestorsAs a shareholder, you may have already conducted fundamental analysis on the stock so its current overvaluation could signal a potential selling opportunity to reduce your exposure to KMX. However, keep in mind the limitations of the P/E ratio when making investment decisions. There are a variety of other fundamental factors that I have not taken into consideration in this article. If you have not done so already, I highly recommend that you complete your research on CarMax by taking a look at the following:Valuation Metrics: how much upside do shares of CarMax have based on Wall Street's consensus price target? Take a look at our analyst upside data explorer that compares the company's upside relative to its peers.Risk Metrics: what is CarMax's asset efficiency? This ratio measures the amount of cash flow that a company generates from its assets.

Many once thought that the auto industry would be immune to the pressures of online shopping because of the desire to test-drive vehicles before purchasing them. Yet the convenience of using the internet is undeniable in an industry known for high-pressure sales tactics, and CarMax (NYSE: KMX) is looking to make maximum use of technology to give its customers as many different ways to buy cars and trucks as possible.Coming into Friday's fiscal third-quarter report, CarMax investors had high expectations for growth in sales and profits. CarMax was able to deliver the goods on much of what investors had wanted to see, and moves in the e-commerce front promise new avenues for future growth along with an awareness of what it takes to attract a new generation of car-buyers to its dealerships.Image source: CarMax.CarMax's fiscal third-quarter results were generally solid. Revenue climbed 4.6% to $4.30 billion, which was just shy of the 5% growth rate that most of those following the stock had wanted to see. Net income of $190.3 million climbed 28% from year-earlier figures, and the resulting earnings of $1.09 per share came in well above the consensus forecast among investors for just $1 per share.Yet to a large extent, CarMax relied on the growth in its dealer network to boost its financial performance. Comparable-store used vehicle sales were down 1.2%, losing the momentum CarMax had generated in the previous quarter when it saw a nice increase in comps. Used vehicle unit sales were up 2.3%, but lower store traffic played a key role in holding the numbers down. In addition, the year-earlier period was especially strong in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, when those in the Houston area who lost their vehicles in the flooding had a huge positive impact to CarMax's six stores there. The company estimates that this had a negative impact of 3.5 percentage points on comps. Gross profit per used car also fell slightly, declining $15 to $2,133.CarMax's other businesses helped the company stay stronger. Vehicle unit sales on the wholesale side were up 10%, and that sent gross profit higher by nearly 12%. Gross profit per unit climbed $16 to $949 per vehicle, and higher appraisal buy rates helped to keep the segment healthy. In the other sales and revenues division, strength in extended protection plan sales helped lift segment revenue by 12%.Vehicle pricing was mixed. Used car prices climbed more than 1% to $20.273 per vehicle, but wholesale prices eased lower by 1% to $5,214.CEO Bill Nash was happy about the way CarMax held up. ""We are pleased to report solid growth,"" Nash said, ""despite having soft comparable store used unit sales this quarter."" The CEO went on to explain how the company's diversified business model helps it stay resilient, even under challenging conditions.Yet CarMax also has a strategy to promote growth. Nash set out CarMax's strategy for incorporating e-commerce to an even larger extent than it has traditionally:We are also excited to introduce our omni-channel experience in Atlanta, where consumers can now customize their car buying experience, whether they want to buy a car completely from home, in-store, or most importantly, through a seamlessly integrated combination of online and in-store experiences.The company hopes it'll be able to boost its overall business by incorporating these improvements.CarMax also kept repurchasing its shares. Buybacks amounted to 3.7 million shares for $254 million. With the company having added another $2 billion in authorized purchases during the quarter, there's no clear end in sight to CarMax's buyback activity.CarMax shareholders celebrated the news, and the stock was higher by nearly 5% at midday following the announcement. Some are growing nervous about a potential economic slowdown that could hit discretionary spending on vehicles in the future, but for now, investors are happy that CarMax is firing on all cylinders.

For context, the S&P 500 lost 6.91% in value.EA data by YCharts.Electronic Arts stock was riding high in the first half of the year, up more than 30% year to date as of July. Entering the month, the stock was already trending down along with the broader market, but management's weak outlook given during the company's second-quarter earnings report in late October didn't sit well with investors.Electronic Arts delivered better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Revenue was $1.286 billion, or $16 million above management's guidance. That translated to net income of $255 million, which was way above management's guidance of approximately $150 million for the quarter.Screenshot of Electronic Arts' Battlefield V. IMAGE SOURCE: ELECTRONIC ARTS.The stronger-than-expected results weren't enough to offset the negative sentiment surrounding the game maker in recent months. Management announced in August that it was delaying the upcoming release of Battlefield V by one month into November. The delay caused management to lower full-year expectations for revenue, which has sent the shares tumbling over the last couple of months.During the recent second-quarter conference call, EA upset the apple cart again by issuing non-GAAP revenue (or net bookings) guidance of $1.725 billion for the holiday quarter, or more than $200 million lower than what analysts were expecting. Some analysts took that as a sign that EA's games are not standing out from a busy fall release schedule that has seen blockbuster releases from rival game companies, such as Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ: ATVI) Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 and Take-Two Interactive's (NASDAQ: TTWO) Red Dead Redemption 2. Both games have been very popular with gamers since launching last month.Lost in the market's focus on EA's weak outlook was management's upbeat forecast for the fourth quarter due to strong early interest they are seeing for Anthem -- a new franchise releasing early next year -- and higher expectations for mobile game Command & Conquer: Rivals.Management maintained its full-year forecast for net bookings of $5.2 billion and earnings per share of $3.11. Wall Street analysts currently expect EA to report adjusted earnings of $4.57 per share for fiscal 2019 (which ends in March). That would represent growth of 3.4% over fiscal 2018.Looking further out, EA has got some things cooking that should leave investors feeling good about the company's long-term growth prospects. This includes a new cloud gaming subscription service and the strides the company is making on the esports scene with its Madden NFL and FIFA franchises.

(NYSE: JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett.“If these three companies can use their scale and technology to create real change and move to value-based payments, it could help move the [health care] system forward.”Targeting Costs, Outcomes With Technology Advancements in digital technology such as telehealth services, remote monitoring and artificial intelligence present opportunities for cost savings and better outcomes in health care, Ricks said.The CEO described the proposed shift from a largely destination, or inpatient, health care system to a delivery model as an “Amazon-like” solution to cost control.“More than a decade after we have iPhones and Skype ... there’s still spotty reimbursement and scant use of something like telehealth.”The Australian health care system provided remote coordination services to Type 2 diabetes patients, Ricks said.Patients recorded a corresponding 1-percentage point drop in blood glucose levels — “that’s a large enough effective size to get a new drug approved by the FDA,” Ricks said — and saw their costs fall by $900 annually.Mergers, Opioids, The ACA And ‘Right To Try’Ricks offered his take Thursday on other topics at the forefront of health care policy discussions.The opioid crisisThe number of Americans dying from opioid overdoses daily is equivalent to an airplane crash, Ricks said.""Believe me, if we were crashing an airplane everyday, we'd be doing something radically different about it.""The most important thing the industry can do is to invent non-addictive pain medication, he said. Eli Lilly has several late-stage non-opioid candidates, he said, including one it plans to submit to the FDA in late 2019 or early 2020 for osteoarthritis and chronic back pain indications.The Right To Try ActEli Lilly has supplied medication “for years” to the patient population affected by The Right To Try Act signed May 30 by President Donald Trump and participated in the FDA’s expanded access program for experimental drugs, Ricks said.Right-to-try could simplify the paperwork for doctors, the FDA and drug companies ""a little bit,"" Ricks said. ""We're sympathetic to the population. This is one more avenue to address what has been a longstanding request. We've been very forward leaning and accommodating of those requests.""M&AWhen asked about mergers such as CIGNA Corporation (NYSE: CI)'s proposed purchase of Express Scripts Holding Co (NASDAQ: ESRX) and the CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS)-Aetna Inc (NYSE: AET) tie-up, Ricks said the deals could help break down silos in health care and apply technological benefits to medical services.The Affordable Care ActThe drug industry was supportive of the ACA when it was introduced because it promised to expand access to care, Ricks said. “What we’ve learned is that access does not equal affordability,” he said, adding that ACA rules that drove up costs resulted in states and insurance companies shifting costs to individuals.The question now is whether to pursue a consolidated nationwide system or a localized one with more customization, Ricks said.“We strongly favor choice in this debate. That’s not uniformly true, but that’s our company’s position.”Related Links:BMO's Bearish Stance On Eli Lilly Comes To An End Detroit Economic Club Names Steve Grigorian As CEO Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks speaks to the Detroit Economic Club at the Westin Book Cadillac Hotel June 7, 2018.

(NYSE: EFX) dipped 22.3% in October, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock saw negative pressure amid sell-offs for the broader market, but the company's third-quarter earnings report was the biggest catalyst behind last month's decline.^SPX data by YCharts.The credit reporting company posted third-quarter results on Oct. 24, delivering sales and earnings for the period that came in below the market's expectations. Guidance for the current quarter also came in below analyst targets, helping to push the stock to a fresh 52-week low.Image source: Getty Images.The average analyst estimate called for Equifax to report adjusted third-quarter earnings of $1.42 per share on sales of $857 million. Actual earnings for the period came in at $1.43 per share on sales of $834.2 million -- and were paired with a less-than-encouraging outlook from management.Prior to the earnings release, the average analyst estimate was targeting earnings per share of $1.43 for the fourth quarter and revenue of $863.8 million. However, management expects earnings for the period to come in between $1.30 and $1.35 and sales to be between $835 million and $850 million. The company is seeing weakening demand for mortgages, and it also continues to incur expenses related to the massive data breach it suffered in 2017.Equifax is one of only three major credit reporting companies, which should work in the business's favor, but its reputation and bottom will likely continue to be negatively impacted by last year's data breach in the near future. The company does appear to be investing to improve security, with expectations to spend $275 million this year improving its technologies and infrastructure.

AVP have lost 37% over the course of a year, primarily attributed to its dismal surprise history. The company lagged earnings estimates in four of the trailing six quarters, with negative sales surprises in six of the last nine quarters. The company also underperformed the industry’s decline of 17.7% in the same time frame.Decline in the company’s Active and Ending Representatives for the last few quarters has been the key reason behind its unimpressive performance. Evidently, Avon’s Active and Ending Representatives fell 5% and 6%, respectively, in third-quarter 2018. Moreover, the company witnessed decline in both Active and Ending Representatives across each of its segments. Further, higher costs of investments for reviving Representatives’ performance have been significantly hurting its margin. Apparently, adjusted operating margin fell 280 basis points (bps) in the third quarter due to higher investments in Representative, sales leader and field expenses. Moreover, increased advertising and net brochure expenses, mainly in Brazil, negatively impacted margins. Gross margin also contracted 410 bps due to higher supply-chain costs and a negative impact from the adoption of the new revenue standard.Will Avon’s Well-Chalked Strategies Revive Stock?Avon is in the third year of its three-year Transformation Plan that focuses on growth, enhancing cost structure and improving financial flexibility. The company progressed significantly, with regard to its goals of enhancing cost structure and improving financial resilience.Impressively, the company accomplished total cost savings of roughly $40 million before taxes in the recently reported quarter. It remains on track to achieve its targeted run-rate savings of $350 million in 2018. Notably, it exceeded the cost-saving target of $230 million, realizing more than $250 million in 2017.Additionally, management initiated the ""Open Up Avon"" strategy, which aims at bringing the company back on its growth trajectory. The company remains committed to attain long-term financial targets for 2021, thanks to the aforementioned strategy. This strategy mainly focuses on reviving its direct selling business, renovating the brand, and enhancing e-commerce and other capabilities to aid performance-driven transformation.By 2021, the company intends to generate total cost savings of $400 million on the back of optimization of manufacturing and distribution; outsourcing efficiencies; zero-based redesigning of back-office functions; and managing revenues, interest and tax. Management also expects to invest roughly $300 million in commercial, digital & IT infrastructure projects. It aims to reinforce its financials, wherein its cash-generating abilities must exceed the investment plans. Moreover, it expects to achieve revenue growth in a low-single digit and margins in low-double digits by 2021.Meanwhile, Avon remains focused on reigniting and re-energizing the Representatives, which are one of the key factors behind the success of its direct-selling business. Further, it has adopted new segmented approach to differentiate among its Representatives and reward them accordingly. The company started imparting training to Representatives by setting up new global academy in each country.Although the aforementioned initiatives inspire optimism, it remains to be seen how far these will aid the company’s stock to return on its growth trajectory.Presently, Avon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want Better-Ranked Consumer Staples Stocks?

She hasn’t officially confirmed her pregnancy, which has only fueled the rumors further. She’s expected to give birth in February, according to People.Notably for her age, at just 20 years old the youngest KarJenner kid is already a cosmetics mogul. Her Kylie Cosmetics brand debuted to meteoric success, which has her sitting atop a fortune.Get the details on Kylie Jenner’s net worth, as she prepares for motherhood and a career.She is the youngest KarJenner kid, but Kylie Jenner is already the second-richest. Only older sister Kim Kardashian’s $175 million fortune can top Kylie Jenner’s net worth of $50 million.Primarily new money, the bulk of her fortune was earned in 2017. Forbes estimates she brought in $41 million in 2017 from endorsements, “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” her Kendall + Kylie clothing line and Kylie Cosmetics — with the latter likely responsible for the bulk of it.If the massive popularity of her cosmetics brand continues, Kylie Jenner’s net worth will likely rise to even larger proportions, with all eyes waiting to see how her 2018 earnings will stack up.Kardashian Net Worth: Who’s the Richest Kardashian or Jenner?Known for her perfect pout, Jenner released her debut Kylie Lip Kits in November 2015. Initially viewed as a test, only 5,000 of each of the three $29 lipsticks and matching lip liners were made, according to Women’s Wear Daily. All Kylie Lip Kits sold out in under a minute.She officially launched Kylie Cosmetics in February 2016. The relaunch included the original three shades and three new ones for Valentine’s Day. Despite the surge in production to 500,000 units of all six shades, all colors sold out in 10 minutes. More than just lipstick, Kylie Cosmetics now features makeup for face and eyes.During its first 18 months in business, Kylie Cosmetics did $420 million in retail sales, her mother Kris Jenner revealed to WWD. This Kylie Jenner makeup brand is poised to see a 25 percent increase in sales for 2017, which WWD revealed puts sales projections for the year at $386 million. If the company’s success continues at this rate, Kylie Cosmetics is slated to become a billion-dollar company by 2022.The brand has already faced its fair share of drama. Indie makeup artist Vlada Haggerty threatened to sue Kylie Cosmetics for nearly duplicating one of her Instagram posts and for the similarity the brand’s dripping lips logo has to some of Haggerty’s work. The issue was settled without a lawsuit, and in January 2017, Jenner promoted Haggerty’s work on her own Instagram account. Just after that was resolved, in February 2017, the brand was accused of repackaging a Lip Kit from her limited-edition holiday collection.Not surprisingly, her famous sisters have collaborated with the brand. Kim Kardashian West debuted her KKW X Kylie collection of lipsticks in April 2017 via Kylie Cosmetics and she’s released multiple Koko Kollections with big sis, Khloe Kardashian.It will be interesting to see which family members are next in line for a Kylie Cosmetics partnership. Among many other projects, she already works with supermodel sister Kendall on their clothing line Kendall + Kylie, so some fans are expecting a collaboration on a lipstick collection. However, Kendall’s advertising contracts with beauty brands like Estee Lauder might preclude her from a collaborating with Kylie Cosmetics anytime soon.In September 2017, TMZ broke the biggest Kylie Jenner news yet: her pregnancy. Rumored to be expecting a baby girl, she has remained mum on her pregnancy and has taken measures to cleverly hide her rumored baby bump. She’s not the only one in the family expecting; sisters Kim Kardashian West and Khloe Kardashian are also preparing to welcome new babies.Kim Kardashian West and her rapper-turned-fashion-designer husband Kanye West are already parents to North, whom Kim gave birth to in June 2013, and Saint, whom she gave birth to in December 2015. After doctors told her she wouldn’t be able to carry any more children, the couple opted to have their third child via surrogate. They announced the birth of a baby girl, Chicago West, via her website on Jan. 15, 2018.Just days after announcing the Kylie Jenner pregnant news, TMZ revealed her older sister Khloe Kardashian is also pregnant with her first child — fathered by boyfriend, Cleveland Cavaliers star Tristan Thompson. After months of saying silent about her own pregnancy rumors, Khloe finally confirmed her pregnancy just in time for Christmas. She is expected to give birth in March or April of 2018. Kim Kardashian West hosted a baby shower in November 2017 to celebrate the birth of her third child. She confirmed in November that the baby is a girl and the “tea for three” themed party was covered in pink hues. Jenner reportedly threw herself a baby shower the next day at her Hidden Hills, Calif., home, but the festivities were kept private, according to People.The new kids will have plenty of cousins to welcome them. In addition to Kim Kardashian West’s three children, Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick are parents to Mason, born in December 2009; Penelope, born in July 2012; and Reign, born in December 2014. Rob Kardashian is also dad to Dream, born in November 2016.They just started dating in April 2017, but Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott are having a baby. The couple was first spotted together at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, in Indio, Calif., where the rapper performed. Things got serious fast, as the two were pictured at an NBA game in his hometown of Houston later that month.In May 2017, Jenner supported her 25-year-old boyfriend at the Rolling Loud festival in Miami, as part of his cross-country Birds Eye View Tour. The couple made a permanent mark with their relationship in June 2017, when they got matching butterfly tattoos, after the release of his “Butterfly Effect” song, which is thought to be about her.Scott was also on-hand for Jenner’s surprise birthday party in August 2017, hosted by her family after his concert with Kendrick Lamar at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The relationship came as a surprise to many, as Scott was initially considered a fling since they got together only weeks after she ended things with rapper Tyga, her on-and-off boyfriend of three years.Jenner’s ex didn’t take the news of her pregnancy well, as he set the rumor mills turning by claiming “Hell nah that’s my kid,” followed by a few devil emojis in a swiftly deleted social media post shortly after news of her pregnancy broke. Tyga is already dad to his 5-year-old son, King Cairo. The little boy shares a mother — model and entrepreneur Blac Chyna — with Rob Kardashian’s daughter, Dream.In an August 2017 episode of her reality show “Life of Kylie,” Jenner revealed she ended things with Tyga because of her young age. She also never wanted to have a baby with Tyga because she didn’t feel their relationship was solid enough, according to a September 2017 TMZ report.Despite being barely out of her teens and in a relatively new relationship with Scott, the Kardashians are fully supportive of Jenner’s pregnancy, according to TMZ. While the family was shocked at first, they believe she’s mature enough to handle motherhood.How Her Ex Stacks Up: Tyga’s Net Worth on His 28th BirthdayMost people her age aren’t even thinking about buying their first home, but Kylie Jenner is already running a real estate empire. She purchased a $2.6 million Calabasas, Calif. home in 2015, when she was just 17 years old, according to E! News. Known as her starter home, TMZ reported that she sold the property for $3.2 million in July 2017.In May 2016, she purchased a $6 million home in Hidden Hills, Calif., according to E! News. Three months later in August 2016, she bought the house next door for $4.5 million, but TMZ reported that she sold the property for roughly $5.4 million in August 2017.Jenner also owns a $12 million Hidden Hills, Calif. home, purchased in September 2016, according to E! News. In October 2017, TMZ reported that she purchased a plot of land adjacent to the property for $5 million in cash, indicating she might be planning a home expansion.This wouldn’t be her first renovation on the property. A May 2017 TMZ report revealed she was renting a $35 million Beverly Hills, Calif., mansion for $125,000 a month while having work done on her current Hidden Hills home.Up Next: Celebrity Net Worths That Will Surprise YouThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Kylie Jenner Net Worth: Find Out How Much the Pregnant Star Is WorthTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

It took hours of practice, encouragement from coworkers, and “determination,” she says, to get her ready to address 15,000 people at the University of Arkansas’s Bud Walton Arena last June.The occasion was Walmart’s annual investors’ meeting, which traditionally draws a huge crowd to the retailer’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters. Few in the audience had blue-collar jobs like Davis’s; she spends her workdays tracking inventory and stocking shelves. Still, as a shareholder, Davis, who goes by Cat, had a right to speak. She’s also a mother of two, and she had come to deliver a petition—signed by more than 100,000 associates—to urge Walmart to give workers like her the same family-leave benefits that executives get.She made the same ask in the arena in a three-minute speech. Full-time associates who became mothers got six- to eight-weeks’ leave at 50% to 60% pay—not much to live on for people whose jobs typically paid $10 to $15 an hour. On the other hand, “Walmart’s female executives receive 10 weeks of paid family leave” at full salary, she explained to the audience in her warm Carolina drawl. “Let’s do the same for our hourly associates—women and men.”A thousand miles from New Bern, Mary Pat Tifft, a 30-year Walmart veteran in Kenosha, Wis., had similar concerns on her mind. Tifft says the company has strayed from its roots: “They used to be very pro-associate and very pro-family, and they’ve totally gotten away from that.” Paid leave wasn’t the only problem. Store managers used to schedule around the needs of families, she says. Then scheduling became automated and “customer first”—making it difficult for new parents to control when they would be home with their kids.In protest, Tifft last December filed a shareholder resolution calling on Walmart to evaluate the risks inherent in providing unequal paid leave. The mother and grandmother admits she isn’t fluent in lawyer-speak—“It’s a lot of legal mumbo jumbo,” Tifft says of her own filing, which labor activists coached her on—but she understands that shareholder protests get attention when employee complaints might not.In January, Walmart triumphantly and unexpectedly announced a new parental-leave policy: 10 paid weeks for all full-time birth mothers, and six weeks at full pay for other new parents. Seemingly overnight, Walmart—America’s largest private employer, with 1.5 million U.S. associates—became the vanguard for family leave for blue-collar workers. “The timing was a little bit uncanny,” says Tifft, dryly. And other service-economy giants quickly fell in line: In the first few months of 2018, Starbucks, Lowe’s, CVS, TJX, Dollar General, Chipotle, and Gap Inc. all bolstered paid-leave policies for hourly employees.For these workers and their advocates, these changes were monumental—extending to hourly-wage earners a benefit associated with the economic elite. Between them, the companies involved employ about 2.8 million people. And unlike the male-dominated tech companies that made a splash in Silicon Valley’s recent paid-leave arms race, their rank-and-file workers are predominantly female—Walmart’s workforce, for example, is 55% women. That matters because women still shoulder most child-rearing and caregiving duties in the U.S., making the lack of paid leave an impediment to their financial security and careers—and a major contributor to the gender pay gap.An important swath of corporate America has reached a tipping point on family leave seemingly overnight. But beneath the veneer of press releases is a years-long, dedicated effort—led by investors, coordinated by activists, and implemented by employees themselves. One of that campaign’s major catalysts is Paid Leave for the United States (PL+US), a two-year-old nonprofit that uses grass-roots tactics and savvy collaboration with shareholders to help workers win better benefits. Over the past year, PL+US has been organizing hourly workers at retailers including Walmart, Starbucks, Target, and Walgreens—as well as advising white-collar employees at companies ranging from Lyft to JPMorgan Chase. Says PL+US founder and executive director Katie Bethell (No. 17 on this year’s World’s Greatest Leaders list): “We are organizing a cubicle army.”The change at Walmart, a retail bellwether, is the kind of victory this army craves. Since March 2017, PL+US had been working with OUR Walmart, a program of the Organization United for Respect—a nonprofit that coordinates employee activism at the company. It was OUR Walmart that coached Cat Davis and Mary Pat Tifft, and PL+US that connected Tifft with investors who helped her draw up her shareholder resolution. Eddie Iny, OUR Walmart’s campaigns director, says the combination of PL+US’s expertise with employee activism was “the total package” that pushed family leave forward on the company’s agenda.Other factors are motivating these benefit changes, of course, from a tight labor market to the windfall created by recent tax cuts. ­Executives at the companies generally downplay or dismiss the influence of employee activism in their decision-making. Jackie Telfair, Walmart’s senior vice president in charge of employee benefits, says the company had been looking at the paid-leave issue “for a long time but hadn’t been able to fully commit until tax reform allowed us to make investments.” Tifft’s proposal, she says, influenced management “no more than hearing from other associates.” But activists like Bethell believe their work has been crucial, channeling workers’ frustrations to nudge employers to act faster. And there’s frustration to harness on every rung of the economic ladder: When it comes to meager family leave, Bethell says, “I have yet to meet a person who’s given birth who’s not pissed off.”The U.S. is the only industrialized country without a paid-leave policy at the national level. The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed 25 years ago, provides for only 12 weeks of unpaid leave (and only for employees at larger companies with longer tenure). There are family-leave laws in force in four states—a fifth, Washington, will have one in January 2019—and a handful of cities, but as of March 2017 only 13% of private-sector workers could get paid time off through their employers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Not having paid leave “fundamentally harms women’s economic potential,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) tells Fortune. Gillibrand is cosponsor of the ­FAMILY Act, a bill that would establish federally mandated paid leave. “Every time she has a family event, a woman has the decision to make: whether to quit her job.” But while the push for a legislative solution is moving slowly at best, family-leave advocates see encouraging signs on the corporate front. The experiences of companies with more generous policies suggest that the advantages might outweigh the associated expenses. A 2017 study by consulting firm BCG, for example, found evidence that paid-leave policies were helping companies boost employee retention, reduce turnover costs, and diversify their leadership.Economic factors are also swinging in employees’ favor. When Walmart broadened its family-leave policies, CEO Doug McMillon cited the recently passed corporate tax cut as their primary driver. But Walmart also faces pressure from both historically low unemployment and changing human resources needs, says Craig Rowley, a senior client partner at HR consultancy Korn Ferry who specializes in retail. As jobs, thanks to automation, become less about stocking shelves and more about high-touch customer service, Walmart needs associates that it can train and retain. Turnover of those skilled employees is becoming a greater concern—hence the better benefits. (The company also recently raised its minimum starting wage to $11 per hour, from $9.)Still, it’s striking that a company famous for its low-cost modus operandi was the first in its cohort to introduce a gold-plated leave benefit. And that’s where PL+US’s fingerprints are visible. If employees are the troops in Katie Bethell’s “cubicle army,” PL+US is the general: arming, strategizing, and boosting morale. When it partners with employee groups, it helps them identify workers who are willing to speak up and provides them with research, toolkits, template policy proposals, and coaching on how to approach management.Influencing the benefits policy at Walmart was about playing a longer game, says Bethell. One of her goals is to change public perception about what constitutes comprehensive family leave. “When I started PL+US, I was looking at lists of best places to work for moms—and they were providing six weeks of paid leave,” Bethell recalls. In the European Union, 14 weeks is the bare minimum; most countries mandate more. “I was like, ‘We are never going to win if the expectations are so, so low.’ ” That made it particularly sweet when Walmart birth moms won a 10-week benefit.Bethell, 38, honed her organizing skills at Change.org and MomsRising.org, where she mobilized voters behind paid-leave laws in New Jersey and Washington, D.C., as well as the federal Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which prohibits gender-based wage discrimination. “She has the characteristic that’s shared by great entrepreneurs, which is that she has this radical vision of how the world can be different,” says Swati Mylavarapu, founder of investment fund Incite Ventures and a PL+US board member. Bethell’s current “radical vision”? Paid family leave for all working Americans.PL+US has a valuable ally in pursuit of that goal: a group of activist investment funds with nearly $7 billion under management collectively, led by Zevin Asset Management, a Boston-based fund whose founder is known for leading campaigns for divestment from apartheid-era South Africa. This summer, the Zevin group launched a campaign to persuade four major employers to change their family-leave policies: Yum Brands, CVS, Starbucks, and Walmart. The last two were especially strategic choices, designed to pressure other employers to follow suit, says Pat Miguel Tomaino, Zevin’s director of socially responsible investing. Walmart provided a floor (“No one wants to be below Walmart,” Tomaino says), and Starbucks was an aspirational ceiling—a company whose reputation for generous benefits would push rivals to match it.Even people who have never met Niko Walker know him as “Niko from Starbucks.” He was a barista in Los Angeles (he has since quit to go to school) and a vocal public advocate for the company, which supported him through and helped pay for his gender transition. That’s why Walker was particularly surprised to learn last year that, if he were to have children, he would get no paid parental leave. At the time, birth and adoptive mothers at Starbucks stores received six weeks of fully paid leave—but fathers were left out.What happened next is a case study in PL+US’s multipronged approach. In June, the group published Left Out, a report that called out companies, including Starbucks, for having inequitable leave policies; publications like the Washington Post and Slate ran with the story. The nonprofit also reached out to Starbucks employees; later in the summer, PL+US flew Walker and other workers to Starbucks’ Seattle headquarters to talk about family leave with executives. The new wrinkle came in September—when the Zevin investor group filed what it says is the first-ever shareholder proposal related to paid leave.The SEC prohibits bringing up “ordinary business” in a shareholder proposal, and simply insisting that a company provide certain benefits would stray into that territory. So the Zevin resolution requested that the coffee giant “evaluate the risk of employment discrimination that may result from Starbucks’ approach to paid family leave.” The investors argued that Starbucks’ policy could be construed as discriminatory to male and LGBTQ workers, exposing the company to lawsuits, harming the brand, and hurting share­holders. The concerns Zevin raised aren’t unwarranted: In the past year alone, JPMorgan Chase and Estée Lauder have been embroiled in legal battles over whether their paltry paternity-leave policies are discriminatory.The Zevin group had little leverage: They owned only a tiny fraction of the roughly $80 billion worth of Starbucks shares outstanding. But Eleanor Bloxham, CEO of the Value Alliance and Corporate Governance Alliance, an organization that helps boards of directors improve corporate practices, points out that resolutions from smaller players can become a major nuisance if they receive media attention. “At that point, it’s not about small investor and large corporation—it’s about public perception.” And PL+US, which by then had put out four widely shared reports about the inadequacy of corporate family-leave policies, had shown it had the power to magnify that perception. (Walmart’s Telfair says she didn’t know what PL+US was a year ago. She does now, thanks to questions from and reporting by the media.)Starbucks made a move before things escalated. The company announced in January that, going forward, parents of both genders would receive six weeks of paid parental leave. Ron Crawford, Starbucks’ vice president of global benefits, tells Fortune that the new policy had been in the works for over a year before Zevin’s resolution was filed, and he says the proposal had no impact on decision-making. He does say, however, that the changes were the result of “always listening to our partners,” Starbucks lingo for workers—and PL+US, of course, had helped those partners’ voices reach higher up the chain of command.It’s typical, says Bloxham, the corporate governance expert, for management not to acknowledge activists’ roles in policy changes. But on issues of gender equity, she adds, activist shareholders “have made a huge difference in the way companies operate.” One prominent example: In 2015, Arjuna Capital, a small asset management firm, filed proposals with nine top tech companies, urging them to analyze and publicize their gender pay gaps. Intel was the first to do so; seven others, including Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook, quickly followed suit. Arjuna wasn’t credited in press releases, but activists felt the timing was hardly coincidental. The bigger takeaway, says Arjuna managing partner Natasha Lamb: Once one firm adopts an employee-friendly standard, “investors are more likely to see it as a competition issue,” and the dominoes start to fall.Advocates see the Walmart and Starbucks actions as the beginning of an even bigger domino effect in family-leave benefits—regardless of who gets credit for pushing over the first tiles. Zevin is currently coordinating an investor statement urging laggards to update their policies. The statement, which will go public in May, had the signature of 17 investment firms with combined assets of over $130 billion as of mid-April. Simultaneously, PL+US will launch “America’s Favorite Brands,” a campaign calling out companies whose paid-leave policies are worse than Walmart’s. PL+US’s Bethell expects the rabble-rousing to bring more good news. “We have wind at our backs,” she says.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

The online craft marketplace has been on a tear of late. Etsy stock now has tripled over the past year, with a 208% gain the 19th best among the nearly 1,900 stocks with a market capitalization over $2 billion.Last week ETSY rose 27% after announcing that it was raising fees on its platforms, while also rolling out new services for its sellers. Those gains followed a Q1 earnings beat last month, and big gains after the Q4 report in late February.Everything seems to be going right for Etsy at the moment. And it’s delivering on the promise that made Tracey Ryniec call it one of the 10 best stocks for 2018. The question now, with Etsy stock at all-time highs and with valuation looking potentially stretched, is if there’s more upside on the way.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Stocks That Could Take a Trade-War Hit The big news on Thursday was that Etsy is raising transaction fees from 3.5% to 5%. The move might not sound like much, but it has a big impact on Etsy’s financials.Guidance for full-year revenue growth was raised 10 points, to 32-34% from 22-24%. That suggests the move, alone, adds nearly 20% to Etsy’s revenue on an annual basis. EBITDA margins are expected to remain intact, as Etsy plans to reinvest some of the extra revenue in marketing and improved seller support. But, there, too, the move suggests profits will rise by almost one-fifth.In that context, a 27% gain makes some sense. A company with 20% higher earnings should be worth at least 20% more. And with the increased spend potentially increasing growth expectations going forward, the long-term effect could be even larger.So the 27% gain on Thursday makes at least some intuitive sense. And it also raises two key questions. The first is how Etsy sellers will react. Raising revenue per dollar of GMS (gross merchandise sales) only works if that GMS holds up. If sellers abandon the Etsy platform in response to the fees, then much, if not most, of the fundamental benefits of the fee hike will be lost.Investors don’t seem to see that as much of a risk at the moment. That, too, makes some intuitive sense. For one, there really aren’t any other platforms for Etsy sellers to go to. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has an Amazon Handmade business that offers 2-hour delivery, but so far Amazon hasn’t been much of a threat to Etsy’s growth.eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) has higher fees, and a far less targeted customer base. Privately held and smaller sites like Aftcra and ArtFire don’t appear likely to take share. If Etsy can continue its steady growth in GMS and take more money doing so, this looks like simply good news.The second question, then, is whether Etsy stock already has priced in the gains. Raised guidance suggests 2018 Adjusted EBITDA around $130 million. In 2019, there should be another ~$10 million in profit contribution from the fee hike alone. Mid-double-digit organic growth suggests 2019 EBITDA of at least $160 million on revenue over $700 million.Against an enterprise value right at $5 billion, both figures suggest pretty steep valuations for Etsy. The stock trades in the range of 30x forward EV/EBITDA, 7x EV/revenue, and likely 60x earnings. But considering the platform nature of the stock, and its growth, those multiples aren’t necessarily prohibitive.Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP) and Square Inc (NYSE:SQ), both targeting small businesses of their own (albeit on a wider scale), trade at much higher multiples, particularly relative to revenue.Of course, both companies also have stronger growth and larger potential markets. SHOP and SQ should trade at higher multiples than ETSY at the moment. Without a direct comparable for ETSY, generating a tight valuation range is difficult.Indeed, from here, ETSY seems to be mostly a “feel” case. Does an investor see the platform as having years of growth ahead of it? Or do the ‘homemade and handmade’ products offered on the site only serve a limited market that is likely to plateau?It’s an interesting coincidence that on the same day ETSY stock was soaring, Michaels Companies Inc (NASDAQ:MIK) stock was plunging. Michaels is an old-line, brick-and-mortar retailer of craft products with a limited online presence. Its growth has stalled out and so has MIK stock.Does that mean that demand is moving online and toward Etsy? Or does it mean that the craft industry as a whole is going to face demographic challenges, and limited growth? An investor’s answer to that question likely determine how he or she feels about Etsy stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned. 6 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $6  7 Stocks That Could Take a Trade-War Hit  5 AI Biotech Stocks to Bet On Now  3 Cheap Stocks Under $3 to Consider Now  Compare Brokers The post Etsy Inc Stock May Very Well Be an Unstoppable Force in the near Term appeared first on InvestorPlace.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

Common characteristics for these big stocks are their strong balance sheet and high liquidity, which means there’s plenty of stocks available to the public for trading. These companies are resilient in times of low liquidity and are not as strongly impacted by interest rate hikes as companies with lots of debt. Assessing the most recent data for XOM, I will take you through the key ratios to measure financial health, in particular, its solvency and liquidity.  See our latest analysis for Exxon Mobil  XOM has sustained its debt level by about US$40b over the last 12 months including long-term debt. At this constant level of debt, the current cash and short-term investment levels stands at US$5.7b , ready to deploy into the business. Additionally, XOM has produced US$35b in operating cash flow over the same time period, leading to an operating cash to total debt ratio of 87%, signalling that XOM’s debt is appropriately covered by operating cash. This ratio can also be interpreted as a measure of efficiency as an alternative to return on assets. In XOM’s case, it is able to generate 0.87x cash from its debt capital.Looking at XOM’s US$65b in current liabilities, it appears that the company may not have an easy time meeting these commitments with a current assets level of US$54b, leading to a current ratio of 0.83x.With a debt-to-equity ratio of 20%, XOM’s debt level may be seen as prudent. This range is considered safe as XOM is not taking on too much debt obligation, which can be restrictive and risky for equity-holders. We can test if XOM’s debt levels are sustainable by measuring interest payments against earnings of a company. Ideally, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) should cover net interest by at least three times. In XOM’s case, the ratio of 29.4x suggests that interest is comfortably covered. High interest coverage is seen as a responsible and safe practice, which highlights why most investors believe large-caps such as XOM is a safe investment.XOM has demonstrated its ability to generate sufficient levels of cash flow, while its debt hovers at an appropriate level. However, its low liquidity raises concerns over whether current asset management practices are properly implemented for the large-cap. I admit this is a fairly basic analysis for XOM’s financial health. Other important fundamentals need to be considered alongside.

As such, the FTC conditioned its support on the sale of 2,431 gas stations — which then amounted to the largest divestiture ever required.""This settlement should preserve competition and protect consumers from inappropriate and anticompetitive price increases,"" FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky said at the time.Upon deal completion, Exxon Mobil surpassed Royal Dutch Shell plc ADR Class A (NYSE: RDS-A) and BP plc (NYSE: BP) Amoco in size.Eventually, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) overtook the firm in market cap to claim the title of world’s largest company.Related Links:From WW To Dunkin': A Look At Some Of The Biggest Corporate Name ChangesHow The Biggest U.S. Companies Have Changed Over A DecadePhoto credit: Ildar Sagdejev WikiSee more from BenzingaAltria's Reported Interest In Juul Wins Sell-Side SupportThis Day In Market History: UN Partitions Palestine For Independent Jewish StateGerman Police Raid Deutsche Bank HQ In Scheme Connected With Panama Papers© 2018 Benzinga.com.

Exxon now aims to trade around more of its growing energy assets to get the best prices for its products and increase earnings, according to an employee familiar with the matter.Expanded trading could add hundreds of millions of dollars to annual earnings from its own buying and selling of crude and fuels, but also comes with problems, including higher risk. Exxon (XOM.N) expects to add 1 million barrels per day of output over the next several years as new oilfields and refinery expansions kick in, giving it more assets to trade.Exxon last year retained John Masek, a former trader at Swiss-based Glencore (GLEN.L), the world's second largest buyer and seller of petroleum, to consult on gasoline trading. Earlier this year, it poached four gasoline market specialists from refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N).This month, Exxon hired former BHP Billiton Plc (BLT.L) trader Nelson Lee as an international crude trader, the people familiar with the matter said. In 2014, Lee orchestrated BHP's first-ever crude exports by maintaining the lightly refined oil met criteria for an exportable product. The deals helped usher in the end to a U.S. prohibition on crude exports more than a year later.The company has also added crude, products and liquefied natural gas specialists to London and Singapore offices. It recently hired Paul Butcher, a trader who has worked at BP Plc (BP.L), Glencore and Vitol, to advise on North Sea markets and accounting for trading transactions.""Paul is known for being a very aggressive, old school crude trader. Exxon would have never hired a risk taker of that scale in the old days. The fact that he is consulting them shows they are considering changes in trading very seriously,"" said a trading house executive who knows Butcher.Phillips 66 declined to comment on the employee departures.Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri referred questions about its trading business and recent hiring to regulatory filings, which note the historical use of financial derivatives and geographic scale to manage commodity price risks.LIMITED RISKChief Executive Darren Woods wants to increase Exxon's profit and appetite for risk at a measured pace, according to people who deal with Exxon. The U.S. operation runs from a trading floor at its Spring, Texas campus that has expanded to as many as 70 workers who will handle everything from Canadian crude to gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.""Trading has been a virtual four-letter word at Exxon,"" said Ehud Ronn, a University of Texas finance professor who studies energy and financial risk management. Exxon has drawn most top managers from engineering backgrounds, not financial services. ""A change in their trading policy would indeed be transformational.""Exxon has long lagged behind rivals BP Plc (BP.L), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), which have created trading units that occasionally generate more profit than their refining businesses.During the oil price downturn of 2015-2016, companies like Shell (RDSa.L) often made more profit in refining than in oil production, also known as upstream, and often cited trading as contributing to the success of the refining division.Shell for example trades more than 8 million barrels per day or 8 percent of global production, twice the size of its own or Exxon's output. The huge figures come partially thanks to trading barrels of third parties, which Exxon currently does on a very limited scale.Exxon would also normally hedge only cargoes going from one region to another and where crude is priced according to different benchmarks. BP and Shell would normally hedge all cargoes as well as taking sometimes a pure speculative position on the paper market to make profit, according to traders working for the firms.""Exxon still doesn't plan to begin speculative paper trading,"" said one source familiar with Exxon's thinking.Woods faces pressure from Exxon investors to lift shares that trade at the same price as 10 years ago. He promised shareholders this year that he can double profit and increase its oil and gas output by 25 percent by 2025.The company's expanded focus on trading brings challenges including added risk from options, swaps and other derivatives, and developing risk-management and compensation systems for the larger business.Exxon has held talks with at least two developers of risk-management software, Enuit LLC and Allegro Development Corp, people familiar with the discussions said. Both offer packages that manage logistics and measure financial exposure. The companies declined to comment on their discussions with Exxon, according to spokespeople.Exxon has also put company veteran managers in charge of overall trading and risk controls at its Spring, Texas, floor, one person familiar with its operations said, to avoid potential losses as it expands trading.""We've heard whispers in the market about this for a few years, so it's great to see them finally hiring commercial talent externally,"" said an executive recruiter familiar with some of the recent hires but who was not directly involved.(Additional reporting by Ron Bousso in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Writing by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Richard Pullin/Adrian Croft)Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

TOT are expected to jointly drill the first deepwater well at the Etzil structure, located in Block 2 of the Perdido Fold Belt, offshore Mexico in October 2018. The well was assigned to the companies in late 2016 as part of the Mexican hydrocarbon auction, which marked the country's energy reform.About EtzilThe companies believe that there is a 50% chance that the 80-square kilometer deepwater structure may contain around 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent proved and probable reserves. The CNH estimates the oil majors to recover about 916 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) from the structure, which is operated by TOTAL. Both Exxon Mobil and TOTAL own 50% stake each in the project. Among Mexico’s auctioned deepwater wells, the Etzil structure is assumed to boast the highest geological success rate at 34%.Partnership’s PlansThe drilling program is divided into two phases. In the first, Etzil-1 will be drilled at 7,000 meters deep. This will be followed by the second phase, wherein another well will be drilled alongside Etzil-1, by the end of 2020 at a depth of 4,900 meters. The partnership is expected to invest at least $129 million during the anticipated four-year long exploration period.Exxon Mobil and TOTAL – both carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) –will conduct several geological studies to de-risk the structure, which will also enable the partnership to identify any other potential exploration sites in the 2,900 square kilometers block. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other DevelopmentsNotably, TOTAL with Statoil ASA STO and BP P.L.C. BP have recognized two other deepwater structures located in the Cuenca Salina basin of Mexico namely Hunab and Serrano, containing 397 million BOE and 325 million BOE, respectively.There are also many other potential exploration targets in the country, currently under recce by oil and gas companies like Chevron, Inpex, CNOOC, et al following the success of energy reform in Mexico that ended the 75-year monopoly of Pemex, the state-owned oil company.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Using the most recent financial data, I am going to take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced using the discounted cash flows (DCF) model. If you want to learn more about this method, the basis for my calculations can be found in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Also note that this article was written in April 2018 so be sure check the latest calculation for F5 Networks here.We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second ‘steady growth’ period. To start off, I took the analyst consensus forecast of FFIV’s levered free cash flow (FCF) over the next five years and discounted these figures at the cost of equity of 9.2%. When estimates weren’t available, I’ve extrapolated the average annual growth rate over the previous five years, capped at a reasonable level. This resulted in a present value of 5-year cash flow of US$3.07B. Keen to know how I calculated this value? Read our detailed analysis here.In the visual above, we see how how FFIV’s earnings are expected to move going forward, which should give you an idea of FFIV’s outlook. Now we need to calculate the terminal value, which is the business’s cash flow after the first stage. I think it’s suitable to use the 10-year government bond rate of 2.8% as the stable growth rate, which is rightly below GDP growth, but more towards the conservative side. Discounting the terminal value back five years gives us a present value of US$9.01B.The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the cash flows, which in this case is US$12.08B. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. This results in an intrinsic value of $195.32, which, compared to the current share price of $157.14, we find that F5 Networks is about right, perhaps slightly undervalued at a 19.55% discount to what it is available for right now. Whilst important, DCF calculation shouldn’t be the only metric you look at when researching a company.For FFIV, I’ve compiled three pertinent aspects you should further examine:Financial Health: Does FFIV have a healthy balance sheet?

The Fed increased the target range for its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a new band of 2.25%-2.5%, putting the Fed funds rate at its highest level since the spring of 2008. All ten voting members of the FOMC voted in favor of Wednesday’s decision.In its statement, the Fed pointed to a labor market that has “continued to strengthen” and economic activity that is “rising at a strong rate.” The Fed did note the slowdown in private investment seen over the last several months, saying “business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.” Along with its latest policy statement the Fed also released an updated set of economic projections, which shows a downgrade in the Fed’s forecast for interest rate hikes next year.The Fed’s latest dot plot now shows the FOMC’s median forecast calling for two rate hikes in 2019, down from three in September. Six members of the FOMC, however, see three rate hikes next year as appropriate. The longer-run neutral rate of interest that is expected to sustain full employment and price stability also fell slightly in December, with the median FOMC forecast now indicating the neutral rate is 2.8%, down from 3% in September.In late November, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell moved markets when he said the Fed funds rate was “just below” the range of estimates for the neutral rate of interest that allows the economy to sustain 2% inflation and full employment. That range of estimates has now come down, indicating the current cycle of interest rate increases is closer to its end than previously thought.Ahead of Wednesday’s meeting markets had all but priced out any further rate increases in 2019. The Fed’s downgrade in its expected path for future rate hikes shows the central bank softening its view towards how many more interest rate increases will be needed before the neutral rate is reached, though market pricing and the Fed’s new forecast are still out of step. Financial market volatility was also acknowledged by the Fed in Wednesday’s statement, with the central bank adding language which said it, “will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook.” In November, the Fed said simply that risks to the economic outlook were roughly balanced. The Fed made a key change to its forward guidance on Wednesday, saying that “some further gradual increases” in the Fed funds rate would be warranted. This alters previous language that had simply said “further gradual increases” would be necessary. The addition of the word “some” — in addition to the new dot plot — suggests the Fed is nearing what it sees as the end of the current tightening cycle.The Fed on Wednesday also tempered its expectations for economic growth this year and next, forecasting real GDP growth of 3% this year and 2.3% next year. In September, the Fed forecasted real GDP growth of 3.1% and 2.5% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Inflation forecasts for the Fed were also downgraded on Wednesday, with core PCE inflation now expected to rise 1.9% this year and 2% over the next three years. In September, the Fed had expected core inflation to rise 2% in 2018 and 2.1% in each of the next three years. Since the Fed’s September meeting, oil prices have declined sharply and inflation data have softened.The Fed’s unemployment forecast was little-changed on Wednesday, with unemployment expected to be 3.7% this year and 3.5% next year, unchanged from September. In 2020 and 2021, the Fed now sees unemployment rates of 3.6% and 3.8%, respectively, increases of 0.1% from September’s forecast. Both years, however, are expected to see unemployment rates below the Fed’s long-run forecast of a 4.4% unemployment rate that sustains a “full employment” environment. On a more technical note, the Federal Reserve also announced that the interest paid on excess reserves, or IOER rate, at 2.4%, 10 basis points below the upper band of the Fed funds rate. In June and then in September, the Fed set the IOER 5 basis points below the Fed funds rate to maintain a cushion between the upper band of its targeted range and the effective rate paid out to reserves kept at the Fed. In recent months, the effective Fed funds rate has been sitting around 2.19%, just 1 basis point below the previous IOER.—Myles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

FedEx Freight had experimented with different types of equipment, but appears to have hit upon the 20-foot straight trucks. It also decided to operate with in-house drivers and branded equipment rather than outsource the work to independent contractors. The latter approach has been used by XPO Logistics Inc (NYSE: XPO) considered the leader in the U.S. last-mile delivery market for heavy goods ordered online. Heavy goods are defined as shipments weighing more than 150 pounds and that can have unconventional dimensions.FedEx Freight has offered last, or ""final-mile,"" residential deliveries for some time. However, it has done so only on an ad hoc basis, and has done little to market or promote it. If successful, the pilot would be the first step in what could be a deeper commitment to the fast-growing segment in terms of equipment, staff, capital, and the Memphis-based parent's vaunted marketing and advertising prowess.If the program is expanded, it would put FedEx Freight, the nation's largest LTL carrier by revenue, in direct competition with Greenwich, Conn.-based XPO, which burst onto the last-mile scene in 2013 when it acquired delivery firm 3PD for $367 million. XPO is the third-largest LTL carrier by revenue, a position it gained in large part through its $3 billion acquisition in 2015 of Con-way Inc., whose portfolio included LTL carrier Con-way Freight.Since the 3PD acquisition, XPO has opened 85 U.S. last-mile hubs, which the company said puts its network within 90 percent of the population. Drivers have been trained to interact with consumers at the residence, bring goods to a designated room or rooms, install the product if necessary, and remove the old item. Mastering those interpersonal skills may be challenging for LTL and truckload drivers alike because they are accustomed to bumping docks and having little contact with end users. Carriers eager to enter the final-mile segment either will need to train drivers in the nuances of home delivery or outsource the delivery operations to a third party.bSince e-commerce demand caught fire about five years ago, order flows have been dominated by parcels weighing less than 70 pounds that are easily conveyable and can fit in delivery vans without dramatically cubing out the trailer space. However, demand for heavy goods deliveries has accelerated as retailers put more of their stock-keeping units, or SKU, available for online purchases.Deliveries of heavy goods ordered online grew by 10.5 percent from 2017 to 2018, following 9.4 percent growth from 2016 to 2017, according to SJ Consulting, a consultancy. Growth has compounded by 9 percent a year since 2012, and last-mile heavy-goods deliveries are now roughly an $8.94 billion a year business, according to the firm's data.In the results of an October survey released yesterday, 37 percent of U.S. consumers polled said they plan to make an online purchase of ""big and bulky products"" weighing more than 150 pounds in the next 12 months. The study was conducted by independent research firm Goodmind and was commissioned by XPO.The increase in heavy goods fulfillment has become a pain point of sorts for traditional parcel providers because much of that merchandise is not conveyable and requires special processing and deliveries. It has also attracted the interest of truckload and LTL carriers who see a chance to incorporate last-mile services into their existing networks.FedEx has imposed peak season surcharges on certain heavy, outsize shipments to offset the increased costs of handling them. Industry watchers believe that FedEx and rival United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) would rather not handle such items because of their handling challenges and because they occupy a disproportionate amount of space aboard their trailers.See more from BenzingaKey Takeaways From The Blockchain In Transport Alliance Fall SymposiumToday's Pickup: What Midterm Elections May Mean For Transportation FundingJob Growth Roars Back In October As Wage Growth Hits The Highest Point Since The Recession© 2018 Benzinga.com.

XPO is the third-largest LTL carrier by revenue, a position it gained in large part through its $3 billion acquisition in 2015 of Con-way Inc., whose portfolio included LTL carrier Con-way Freight.Since the 3PD acquisition, XPO has opened 85 U.S. last-mile hubs, which the company said puts its network within 90 percent of the population. Drivers have been trained to interact with consumers at the residence, bring goods to a designated room or rooms, install the product if necessary, and remove the old item. Mastering those interpersonal skills may be challenging for LTL and truckload drivers alike because they are accustomed to bumping docks and having little contact with end users. Carriers eager to enter the final-mile segment either will need to train drivers in the nuances of home delivery or outsource the delivery operations to a third party.bSince e-commerce demand caught fire about five years ago, order flows have been dominated by parcels weighing less than 70 pounds that are easily conveyable and can fit in delivery vans without dramatically cubing out the trailer space. However, demand for heavy goods deliveries has accelerated as retailers put more of their stock-keeping units, or SKU, available for online purchases.Deliveries of heavy goods ordered online grew by 10.5 percent from 2017 to 2018, following 9.4 percent growth from 2016 to 2017, according to SJ Consulting, a consultancy. Growth has compounded by 9 percent a year since 2012, and last-mile heavy-goods deliveries are now roughly an $8.94 billion a year business, according to the firm's data.In the results of an October survey released yesterday, 37 percent of U.S. consumers polled said they plan to make an online purchase of ""big and bulky products"" weighing more than 150 pounds in the next 12 months. The study was conducted by independent research firm Goodmind and was commissioned by XPO.The increase in heavy goods fulfillment has become a pain point of sorts for traditional parcel providers because much of that merchandise is not conveyable and requires special processing and deliveries. It has also attracted the interest of truckload and LTL carriers who see a chance to incorporate last-mile services into their existing networks.FedEx has imposed peak season surcharges on certain heavy, outsize shipments to offset the increased costs of handling them. Industry watchers believe that FedEx and rival United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) would rather not handle such items because of their handling challenges and because they occupy a disproportionate amount of space aboard their trailers.See more from BenzingaKey Takeaways From The Blockchain In Transport Alliance Fall SymposiumToday's Pickup: What Midterm Elections May Mean For Transportation FundingJob Growth Roars Back In October As Wage Growth Hits The Highest Point Since The Recession© 2018 Benzinga.com.

Johnson(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) will screen every package at the Texas facility where a parcel exploded on Tuesday, according to a FedEx manager, describing extraordinary steps the company is taking in response to a series of bombings in the state capital.The package delivery company will also X-ray entire truckloads of parcels at its sorting facility outside Austin, and then divert them elsewhere for sorting and delivery, said the FedEx employee who was not authorized to speak on the record. The source does not work at the sorting facility but was briefed on the situation.FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said he had no immediate comment.The blast at FedEx on Tuesday was one of five explosions in Texas in the past 18 days. A sixth explosion on Tuesday night did not appear related, authorities said. The five attacks have killed two people, injured others and left hundreds of federal and local investigators scrambling to find the perpetrator and a motive.Package screening is not routine at the nation's big delivery companies such as FedEx, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) or the U.S. Postal Service. The industry delivers a total of around 40 million parcels in the United States each day, industry experts said. Checking every package on a regular basis would virtually paralyse their operations.FedEx will carry out the special screenings at the sorting facility in Schertz, Texas where the package exploded, injuring one worker, and at a second location in Austin, where another explosive device was found, the employee said. The second package was turned over to police.""FedEx in conjunction with the authorities are field X-raying all the packages one at a time,"" the employee said. ""From then on, we will be doing bulk X-rays of entire trailers.""Packages will likely be delayed by a day or two at the facility, and FedEx was re-routing all other packages to its hub in Houston to avoid further delays, he said.FedEx has provided law enforcement with ""extensive evidence from our advanced technology security systems designed to protect the safety of our teammates, our customers and the communities we serve,"" Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith told analysts on Tuesday after the company reported quarterly financial results.FedEx will provide authorities with the location where the package was picked up by the driver and the time, the employee said, providing authorities with a wealth of data.Satish Jindel, a founder of the delivery company that became FedEx Ground and now serves as president of ShipMatrix, which tracks on-time shipments, said it was highly unlikely that the industry would move toward routine screening. Package bombs are rare, he said, making it unrealistic to check every package, every day, considering the enormous cost.""They don't, they can't, and they shouldn't, and it would be unreasonable and ignorant for this country and for people to expect it,"" Jindel said. ""It would shut the economy down.""For now, the industry will likely rely on employees who are trained to flag suspicious packages, Jindel said.UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said the world's largest package delivery company has security measures in place and was cooperating with law enforcement in their investigation, but declined to comment further.DHL Worldwide Express said it had ""standard"" security and screening procedures in place and that its security teams were monitoring the situation in Texas.The U.S. Postal Service uses technology, targeted screening and employee training to stop suspicious packages, spokesman Dave Partenheimer said.The FedEx manager with knowledge of the incident said the blast appeared to have been set off by a mechanical arm that diverts packages along a conveyer belt. When the arm came out and hit the package, it exploded on the sorter just as it entered a chute, he said.""The good thing is it went off when it was going down the chute,"" he said. ""The chute actually shielded anybody below from the blast.""(Reporting by Eric M.

However, this recent downturn isn’t likely to scare off many value investors, and it might actually make stocks like these two shipping and delivery powers look even more attractive.FedEx and UPS have long dominated the industry that they helped revolutionize, which is now set to grow based on the expansion of e-commerce and increased demand for extremely fast shipping. The companies do face competition from Amazon AMZN and others, but the two legacy giants offer both stability and value, which look even more attractive amid this newly volatile market.FedEx and UPS also seem to attract similar buy-and-hold investors. With that said, these same investors likely understand the value of a diverse portfolio. This means they might only want to pick one of these two shipping stocks.So which of these stocks is the better buy right now? Let’s take a closer look.ValuationTraditional value investors love to look at the price-to-earnings ratio to determine great buying opportunities. After all, buying a stock makes one a partial owner of that company, so investors are inherently interested in profitability.Here is a look at the Forward P/E trend for FDX and UPS over the last year:One of the first things to note here is that UPS consistently traded at a premium to FDX over the last year. But this changed in early February, when investors can see FDX jump above its counterpart. This quick transition suggests that investors have reason to believe that FedEx is worthy of a premium over UPS going forward, where they previously thought UPS deserved to be the more expensive stock.Still, investors who are on the hunt for value should consider both of these stocks, as they are trading relatively in line with the “Transportation - Air Freight Market” industry’s average Forward P/E of 13.8.PerformanceValue investors should also be interested in a stock’s recent price performance. For instance, if a stock has sold off significantly, its lower valuation might speak to a greater problem that has forced investors to flee.Check out how FDX and UPS have performed since this time last year:As we can see, FedEx outpaced UPS for almost a full year. Then, in early February, we notice a huge divergence in share price, where UPS plummets while FDX dips. FedEx was also able to recover amid the recent downturn, while UPS currently rests near a 52-week low. These moves also help to explain why investors quickly became willing to pay a slight premium for FDX.Zacks RankWe demonstrated that both of FDX and UPS are relatively intriguing picks, but the best value plays are undervalued companies that also boast strong Zacks Ranks. In this case, both stocks are once again neck and neck, as FedEx and UPS are currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks.However, the proven Zacks Rank system puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions. And this seems to give the edge to FDX.Within the past 60 days, we have seen 11 revisions to FDX’s full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside. Meanwhile, UPS has earned five upward revisions along with seven downward revisions.With all this said, it seems that FedEx looks like the more attractive stock based on its momentum, positive analyst sentiment, and attractive valuation.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After all, buying a stock makes one a partial owner of that company, so investors are inherently interested in profitability.Here is a look at the Forward P/E trend for FDX and UPS over the last year:One of the first things to note here is that UPS consistently traded at a premium to FDX over the last year. But this changed in early February, when investors can see FDX jump above its counterpart. This quick transition suggests that investors have reason to believe that FedEx is worthy of a premium over UPS going forward, where they previously thought UPS deserved to be the more expensive stock.Still, investors who are on the hunt for value should consider both of these stocks, as they are trading relatively in line with the “Transportation - Air Freight Market” industry’s average Forward P/E of 13.8.PerformanceValue investors should also be interested in a stock’s recent price performance. For instance, if a stock has sold off significantly, its lower valuation might speak to a greater problem that has forced investors to flee.Check out how FDX and UPS have performed since this time last year:As we can see, FedEx outpaced UPS for almost a full year. Then, in early February, we notice a huge divergence in share price, where UPS plummets while FDX dips. FedEx was also able to recover amid the recent downturn, while UPS currently rests near a 52-week low. These moves also help to explain why investors quickly became willing to pay a slight premium for FDX.Zacks RankWe demonstrated that both of FDX and UPS are relatively intriguing picks, but the best value plays are undervalued companies that also boast strong Zacks Ranks. In this case, both stocks are once again neck and neck, as FedEx and UPS are currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks.However, the proven Zacks Rank system puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions. And this seems to give the edge to FDX.Within the past 60 days, we have seen 11 revisions to FDX’s full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside. Meanwhile, UPS has earned five upward revisions along with seven downward revisions.With all this said, it seems that FedEx looks like the more attractive stock based on its momentum, positive analyst sentiment, and attractive valuation.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at other big companies. Then we’ll look at a snap shot of the business growth. Third, we’ll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO.  Check out our latest analysis for FMC  Our data indicates that FMC Corporation is worth US$11b, and total annual CEO compensation is US$13m. (This is based on the year to 2017). While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$1.2m. We looked at a group of companies with market capitalizations over US$8.0b and the median CEO compensation was US$11m.That means Pierre Brondeau receives fairly typical remuneration for the CEO of a large company. Although this fact alone doesn’t tell us a great deal, it becomes more relevant when considered against the business performance.You can see a visual representation of the CEO compensation at FMC, below.On average over the last three years, FMC Corporation has grown earnings per share (EPS) by 75% each year. In the last year, its revenue is up 73%.This shows that the company has improved itself over the last few years. Good news for shareholders. The combination of strong revenue growth with medium-term earnings per share improvement certainly points to the kind of growth I like to see.You might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for future earnings.Most shareholders would probably be pleased with FMC Corporation for providing a total return of 101% over three years. So they may not be at all concerned if the CEO is paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.Remuneration for Pierre Brondeau is close enough to the median pay for a CEO of a large company .Shareholders would surely be happy to see that shareholder returns have been great, and the earnings per share are up. So one could argue the CEO compensation is quite modest, if you consider company performance! So you may want to check if insiders are buying FMC shares with their own money (free access). Or you might prefer gaze upon this detailed graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow .To help readers see past the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data.

Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership.Ford Motor has a market capitalization of US$37.78b, so it’s too big to fly under the radar. We’d expect to see both institutions and retail investors owning a portion of the company. In the chart below below, we can see that institutions own shares in the company. Let’s take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about F.  View our latest analysis for Ford Motor  Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Ford Motor does have institutional investors; and they hold 60.8% of the stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there’s always a risk that they are in a ‘crowded trade’. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Ford Motor’s historic earnings and revenue, below, but keep in mind there’s always more to the story.Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don’t have a many shares in Ford Motor. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.The definition of company insiders can be subjective, and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Ford Motor Company. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$419.4m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. The general public holds a 38.1% stake in F. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past. You can access this detailed graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow .Ultimately the future is most important. You can access this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Big corporations are much sought after by risk-averse investors who find diversified revenue streams and strong capital returns attractive. But, the key to their continued success lies in its financial health. Let’s take a look at Ford Motor’s leverage and assess its financial strength to get an idea of their ability to fund strategic acquisitions and grow through cyclical pressures. Remember this is a very top-level look that focuses exclusively on financial health, so I recommend a deeper analysis into F here. See our latest analysis for Ford MotorOver the past year, F has ramped up its debt from US$142.97B to US$154.29B – this includes both the current and long-term debt. With this growth in debt, F currently has US$26.49B remaining in cash and short-term investments for investing into the business. Moreover, F has produced cash from operations of US$18.10B over the same time period, leading to an operating cash to total debt ratio of 11.73%, signalling that F’s current level of operating cash is not high enough to cover debt. This ratio can also be a sign of operational efficiency as an alternative to return on assets. In F’s case, it is able to generate 0.12x cash from its debt capital.At the current liabilities level of US$94.60B liabilities, it appears that the company has been able to meet these commitments with a current assets level of US$115.90B, leading to a 1.23x current account ratio. For Auto companies, this ratio is within a sensible range since there is a bit of a cash buffer without leaving too much capital in a low-return environment.Since equity is smaller than total debt levels, Ford Motor is considered to have high leverage. This is not unusual for large-caps since debt tends to be less expensive than equity because interest payments are tax deductible. Accordingly, large companies often have lower cost of capital due to easily obtained financing, providing an advantage over smaller companies. We can check to see whether F is able to meet its debt obligations by looking at the net interest coverage ratio. Preferably, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) should be at least three times as large as net interest. For F, the ratio of 6.47x suggests that interest is appropriately covered. Strong interest coverage is seen as a responsible and safe practice, which highlights why most investors believe large-caps such as F is a safe investment.At its current level of cash flow coverage, F has room for improvement to better cushion for events which may require debt repayment. Though, the company exhibits an ability to meet its near-term obligations, which isn’t a big surprise for a large-cap. This is only a rough assessment of financial health, and I’m sure F has company-specific issues impacting its capital structure decisions.

In 1903, founder Henry Ford and 11 other private investors split a total of 1,000 shares of stock in the company. Ford himself held 255 of those shares. By Oct. 1, 1903, Ford Motor Company had already turned a profit of $37,000.Henry Ford died in 1947, but when the company went public in 1956, the Ford family initially maintained 40 percent ownership of the company. The IPO priced at $64.50 per share, and Ford finished its first day up public trading at a price of $70.50 and a market cap of $660 million.As of 2006, the Ford family still owned roughly 5 percent of Ford’s outstanding shares.Today, Ford trades at just $13.10 per share, but its market cap has grown to a staggering $54 billion.Related Links:This Day In Market History: Operation Desert StormNAFTA: Trump's Next Target After Tax Reform?See more from BenzingaNAFTA: Trump's Next Target After Tax Reform?© 2018 Benzinga.com.

Year to date, Ford's sales are still down 1.8%, thanks to a weakening market for sedans and so-so results for its older SUV models.Sales of several key Ford models have lagged rivals' recently, but the all-important F-Series continues to sell in big numbers. Image source: Ford Motor Company.Here are the June sales results for the six largest-selling automakers in the U.S. market. The overall U.S. light-vehicle market rose 5.2% in June, according to figures from Automotive News, meaning that Ford's gain lagged the market's growth. AutomakerJune 2018 U.S. SalesChange vs. June 2017General Motors (NYSE: GM)256,9765.7%Ford230,6351.2%Toyota209,6023.6%Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU)202,2648%Honda146,5634.8%Nissan145,0961.2%Data sources: The automakers, Automotive News. Figures for General Motors are Automotive News estimates, as GM no longer reports its U.S. sales on a monthly basis. The high points:We have to start with the F-Series, Ford's ""crown jewel"" and the single biggest driver of its profits. F-Series sales rose 1.7% in June from a very good year-ago result, to 79,204 sold for the month.The F-Series' average transaction price in June was a strong $46,800. Sales of Ford-brand SUVs as a group rose 8.1% in June. Key drivers: Good gains for the compact Escape (up 6.4%) and big Expedition (up 10.1%), and the new EcoSport's best monthly result yet, with 6,756 sold. Most Ford-brand cars struggled in June. A happy exception: Sales of the Mustang, which was revamped for 2018, were up 19.6% from a year ago. The Mustang was revamped for 2018. Sales have been good, making it one of very few bright spots in Ford's sagging car portfolio. Image source: Ford Motor Company.Ford's year-over-year sales gain came despite a drop in overall fleet sales. The Blue Oval's U.S. retail sales rose 2.9% in June. Average transaction prices were up $540 from a year ago, suggesting that Ford's incentive use remains disciplined. That's good news for profit margins. Sales of the Transit commercial van rose 25% from a year ago. While Ford's overall fleet sales were down, its sales to commercial fleets rose 6% last month. Lincoln sales rose 2.8%, on good gains for its compact MKC and large Navigator SUVs. The Navigator is all-new and reviews have been strongly positive; sales were up 68.4% in June, and its average transaction price rose a whopping $27,000. Sales of the Police Interceptor version of the Explorer rose 2.3% to 3,051 -- but sales of the police version of the Taurus sedan fell 13% to just 637. (The net result: Sales of Ford police vehicles fell by 26 units from a year ago.) Sales of the super-expensive Ford GT sports car rose 22.2%, but don't get too excited: That's 11 GTs delivered in June, versus nine in June of 2017. Year to date, Ford has delivered 67 GTs, up from 21 in the first half of last year. The not-so-high points:Ford's sedans are still struggling. Sales of Ford-brand cars as a group fell 13.2% from (fairly poor) year-ago results; Lincoln's cars were down 26.6%. Only the tiny Fiesta managed a year-over-year sales gain.Of note: After a strong debut, the Lincoln Continental is struggling. Ford sold just 546 in the U.S. in June, down 44% from a year ago. Also of note: The Lincoln MKZ is a mechanical sibling of the soon-to-be-discontinued Ford Fusion. The two are made on the same production line. Ford hasn't said anything about the MKZ's fate, but its sales are down 32.5% year to date.The huge (and hugely profitable) Lincoln Navigator is all new and much improved for 2018. Demand has been very strong. Image source: Ford Motor Company.Ford's mixed-bag results for June followed similar results in April and May. For the second quarter, Ford's U.S. sales fell about 0.8% -- but within that result, and despite turbulence in the overall U.S. market, some profit-boosting trends remained intact for Ford.For starters, F-Series sales rose 5.5% in the quarter, and average transaction prices remained strong -- both good signs for profitability. The big and super-profitable Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, both all new (and hugely improved) for 2018, continued to sell very well at strong prices. Commercial-vehicle sales remained strong, and sales of the Mustang rose 5% in the quarter.Long story short: While the U.S. new-car market is showing signs of slipping, Ford's most profitable products continued to sell well in the second quarter, at what appear to be good prices. That's a good sign for Ford's profit in North America. We'll know more when the Blue Oval reports its second-quarter earnings on July 25.

Revenue of $37.6 billion was up about $1.1 billion from a year ago, on an improved ""mix"" of products sold, particularly in North America.Ford made some small adjustments to its full-year guidance but maintained the revised full-year profit target that it issued in July.U.S. sales of the big and very profitable Ford Expedition rose 35.6% in the third quarter, helping to keep Ford's North American margin strong. Image source: Ford Motor Company.Here are the key numbers from Ford's third-quarter 2018 results.MetricQ3 2018Change vs. Q3 2017Revenue$37.6 billion3%Wholesale shipments (rounded to the nearest thousand)1,353,000(10%)Adjusted EBIT$1.7 billion(26%)Automotive EBIT margin4%(1.6 ppts)Net income$991 million(37%)Adjusted earnings per share$0.29(34%)Data source: Ford Motor Company. EBIT is earnings before interest and tax. ""Adjusted"" figures exclude the effects of one-time items. Ford took one-time charges totaling $231 million in the third quarter, most related to employee separations. ""Vehicles sold"" are wholesales and are rounded to the nearest thousand. ppts = percentage points.Ford has work to do, and the company knows that. Its operations in Europe, South America, and especially China all posted losses in the third quarter. All need new products and significant restructuring.The good news is that those products are coming and the restructuring work has begun, though it's too early to say when those efforts will show results on the bottom line. In the meantime, other parts of Ford's business continued to do well: North America, Ford Credit, and Asia Pacific (outside China) all posted solid results.Here's a look at how each of Ford's business segments performed. Note that all financial results in this section are reported on an EBIT basis, except as noted.North America: Ford earned EBIT of $2 billion in North America, up from about $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Ford's U.S. sales fell 3.7% in the quarter, in large part because of a supplier fire that interrupted truck production earlier in the year. But Ford was still able to generate good results with its high-margin trucks and large SUVs, which helped keep earnings strong. Ford's EBIT margin in North America, a widely watched number, was 8.8%, roughly equal to a year ago.South America: Ford lost $152 million in South America, $2 million worse than a year ago. Big gains on pricing were more than offset by costs related to inflation and unfavorable exchange-rate movements. CFO Bob Shanks said Ford is in the early stages of a major ""redesign"" of its business in South America, but he had no details and no timeline to share.Europe: Ford lost $245 million in Europe, versus a loss of $53 million a year ago. The story here is not awful: Ford is in the midst of launching an all-new Focus in Europe; launch-related costs and limited supplies of the big-selling model were part of the story here, as were exchange-rate-related declines and weak markets in Turkey and Russia.Middle East and Africa: Good news here, as Ford's small Middle East and Africa unit earned $47 million, up from a $56 million loss a year ago, despite a revenue decline driven by lower sales volumes. Costs are down, product ""mix"" improved, and pricing was strong.Asia-Pacific: Ford's Asia-Pacific unit lost $208 million, a dramatic decline from a $314 million profit a year ago. Much of the story here is China, where Ford's sales were down 37% in the third quarter. That alone accounted for $480 million of the decline. Ford has a major restructuring under way in China, a high priority for CEO Jim Hackett, but it will probably take several quarters to show meaningful results.Mobility: Ford's mobility segment, which includes its autonomous-vehicle effort and its Ford Smart Mobility initiatives, lost $196 million, versus a $72 million loss in the year-ago period. The larger loss represents increased investments -- an additional $58 million invested in Smart Mobility, and an additional $66 million in autonomous-vehicle development, versus the third quarter of 2017.Ford Credit: Profit before tax for Ford's captive-financing arm was an impressive $678 million, its best quarterly result in over seven years and a $78 million increase from a year ago. Much of the gain was due to higher auction values for off-lease vehicles returned to Ford and to a good increase in volume. Lease penetration of 21% remains well below the industry average of 29%, and credit quality remains high. Good news all around.Ford ended the third quarter with $23.7 billion in cash available to its automotive business, down from $26.5 billion as of the end of 2017 but still an ample reserve. It had an additional $11 billion in available credit lines, for total automotive liquidity of $34.7 billion.Against that, it had $15.3 billion in well-structured long-term debt attributable to its automotive business, down from $16.5 billion at the end of 2017.Ford made two minor updates to the revised guidance it issued after the second quarter. It now expects full-year results in South America to be about the same as 2017, where it had previously expected a slight improvement, and it now expects to pay an adjusted effective tax rate of about 10%, versus 13% in its earlier guidance.Of note: Ford maintained its profit guidance. It still expects adjusted earnings per share for the full year to come in between $1.30 and $1.50. Through the first three quarters, Ford has earned $1 per share on that basis.

It did.Ford opened for trade yesterday at $7.85 per share. At that price it had a PE of 5.06x and a dividend yield of 7.64%. All of this after the price popped 3% a day earlier, when people were buying anything in the market’s after-Christmas surge.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsJust as it is foolish to argue with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at $326 per share, and short it, it’s equally foolish to argue with Ford’s price. It is what it is. The same day Ford gained 3%, Tesla was up 10%. 10 Hot Companies Going Public in 2019 People like what they like. All you can really do is ask why.Since Jim Hackett was named CEO in May 2017, Ford stock is down 28% while General Motors (NYSE:GM) is up slightly.This is not because Hackett is stupid. The plans he set — abandoning standard cars, emphasizing trucks and SUVs, investing in electric and autonomous technology — have become GM’s playbook as well.Ford also looks to be on track to approach 2017’s $156 billion in sales, with $36.3 billion in revenue and a profit of 33 cents per share expected when it reports in January. That profit is more than double the company’s 15 cents per share dividend payout. Ford consistently covers the dividend with earnings.Investors just don’t see Ford getting through the next recession. U.S. auto sales peaked in 2017 but have been hovering stubbornly close to that peak ever since, coming in at 16.72 million for October. At the bottom of the last recession, in 2009, only 9 million cars were selling each month.At the end of September Ford had just $12 billion in long-term debt, $1.7 billion in current debt, and $23.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. In theory, it could pay all its debts at a stroke. The company has averaged $5 billion in operating cash flows the last two quarters.By way of comparison, Tesla was sitting on $9.7 billion in long-term debt and $3 billion in cash at the end of September and had under $1 billion in operating cash flow for the first three quarters of the year.At Ford’s Dec. 27 market cap of $31 billion, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could buy Ford for its Waymo self-driving car unit with the equivalent of seat cushion money, despite a horrible three months that has taken the equivalent of more than three Fords off its market cap. 10 Stocks That Won Big In 2018 As an investor, in other words, you’re still better off in tech than in an industrial stock like Ford. The company’s international business continues to struggle, making it ever-more-dependent on the gas guzzling U.S. market to stay afloat.The trade wars are already rocking Ford, with China sales rolling over, and Ford considering a risky joint-venture with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAY), sharing development costs and assembly plants.Ford says the restructuring it announced in June, which includes plans to spend $11 billion over three-to-five years, will likely result in the loss of more than 10% of its 202,000 jobs.To show that the company intends to be a viable part of its hometown, Ford has begun the renovation of a 100 year-old Detroit train station. But investors have written off Ford as they have written off downtown Detroit, which seems unfair. At its current price Ford should be a buy. But heading into what may be another recession, it’s still anything but that.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Chinese New Year is a a lunar holiday that sometimes falls in January and sometimes in February. Because most stores in China, including auto dealers, are closed for several days around the holiday, it tends to put a dent in automakers' monthly sales totals. When it falls in January in one year and February the next, as it did in 2017 and 2018, that can make for confusing year-over-year results.This big Ford Taurus sedan, a close relative of the Lincoln Continental, was designed specifically for China and launched in 2016. It sold well at first, but Chinese car buyers have since lost interest: Sales were down 53% this year through February. Image source: Ford Motor Company.That's why many analysts wait to look at January and February together when assessing an automaker's year-over-year sales performance in China at the beginning of a new year. When we do that, it becomes clear that Ford's problems in China go far beyond the timing of a holiday. AutomakerYear-to-Date SalesChange vs. 2017General Motors (NYSE: GM)633,70612%Volkswagen (VW brand only)486,10010.2%Nissan 213,1729.7%Toyota 203,40010.8%Honda 203,2393.9%Ford (NYSE: F)123,473(23%)Overall3,931,7002.1%Data sources: The automakers, Automotive News. Year-to-date sales are through Feb. 28. Overall figures are for all light vehicles sold in China during the period and are approximate.Year to date, Ford's sales in China are down 23%, while nearly all of its global mass-market competitors -- as well as the overall market -- have gained ground. So what's happening here? Michael Dunne is the former head of J.D. Power China and of GM's Indonesia operation. He now runs a Hong Kong-based investment advisory company, Dunne Automotive, and keeps a close eye on developments in the auto industry in China. I asked him for his thoughts on why Ford's sales have slipped so much in China lately. He said:Ford has two significant challenges, one short term and one long term. Right now, they're beset by aging product, and new models won't start to arrive until the fourth quarter [of 2018]. Ford is also light on emotional connection to Chinese buyers. It's at risk of losing sales to much-improved Chinese cars and SUVs.Ford is at a tough point in its product cycle. Most of its core products are a few years old. That's more of a problem in China than in most markets, where things seem to move very quickly because there are so many competitors. In addition to the latest models from just about all of the global automakers, Chinese car buyers can choose vehicles from a slew of domestic Chinese automakers that (mostly) aren't yet well-known elsewhere, and that have a big incentive to undercut the global brands to build credibility and market share. The second issue is more nuanced. Some global auto brands have spent years building up dedicated followings in China. GM's Buick brand is one: Buick is a small player in the U.S. these days, but it's consistently GM's best-selling brand in China, because it has earned the loyalty of lots of Chinese customers over time.Ford has lots of loyal customers in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere. But as Dunne points out, Ford doesn't have that kind of following in China -- at least, not yet. I suspect that's simply because Ford didn't start ramping up its presence in China until around 2012, by which time GM, VW, and others were well-established players. Ford announced an overhaul plan for China in December that includes a bunch of new products, increased local production, and changes to Ford's distribution network. That will give Ford's Chinese dealers fresh products -- eventually. But what about building customer loyalty?That's a harder problem to solve. I thought that Ford might have found a solution when it hired Jason Luo, a Chinese-speaking American executive, to run its China operation last year. But Luo abruptly left Ford in January for reasons that weren't made clear. Finding a similarly qualified replacement should be the next step in Ford's effort to get back on a growth path in China.

In conjunction with its first-quarter earnings report, the automaker announced that by 2020, almost 90% of Ford's North American model lineup will consist of trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles.As part of this transition, Ford will discontinue five key models in the domestic market: the Fiesta, C-MAX, Focus, Fusion, and Taurus. This radical decision has received mixed reviews from investors and auto industry pundits. Some view it as a smart move to eliminate unprofitable lines of business, while others see the shift away from cars as shortsighted. Let's take a look at some of the key arguments on both sides.By 2020, Ford will sell just two car models in North America: the Mustang and the forthcoming Focus Active. Neither is a traditional sedan -- or hatchback, for that matter. The iconic Mustang is a high-performance pony car, while the Focus Active will feature higher ground clearance than the current Ford Focus, making it closer to a crossover. (Indeed, Ford CEO Jim Hackett described it as a crossover last week.)The segments Ford is abandoning have been declining, but they still represent a significant piece of the market. During the first three months of 2018, Ford sold 100,956 vehicles in the U.S. across the five models that will be discontinued. This was down 12.2% year over year, but it still represented 17.5% of the Ford brand's U.S. sales volume.The Ford Fusion is one of five car models that Ford will drop in the U.S. Image source: Ford Motor Company.At an industry level, cars are still expected to account for about 27% of consumer vehicle purchases in 2022, according to LMC Automotive. Thus, Ford is walking away from market segments that will continue to be important for the foreseeable future.While Ford still sells a fair number of cars in the U.S., models like the Fiesta, Focus, and Fusion all lose money today. Many are delivered to rental car companies at bargain-basement prices. In the consumer market, Ford has to offer massive discounts to move cars off of its dealers' lots.Crossovers are far more profitable, largely because consumers tend to see them as more desirable. Additionally, the difference in price between sedans and crossovers has narrowed in recent years. Indeed, in January, Ford began U.S. sales of the EcoSport: its first entry-level crossover for the domestic market. The starting price is just $19,995, though a typically equipped version would cost significantly more.If consumer preferences are set to continue shifting toward crossovers, it makes sense for Ford to double down on that slice of the market.Crosstown rival General Motors (NYSE: GM) is moving in a similar direction. It is working to broaden its crossover lineup with an ever-expanding array of models. And while GM doesn't plan to exit the U.S. car market entirely, it is likely to discontinue at least two models in the next few years: the Chevy Sonic and the Chevy Impala.Historically, one reason automakers like Ford and GM built small cars was to draw potential customers into dealerships with cheap cars and then ""upsell"" them to more profitable models. The arrival of the EcoSport means Ford will still have an affordable entry-level model to fill this role. However, its starting price is nowhere near the Ford Fiesta's base price of $14,205.Rising fuel prices potentially represent an even bigger risk to Ford's strategy. Cheap gas has certainly fueled the market shift toward crossovers over the past few years. However, the national average gasoline price has risen by more than $0.40/gallon over the past year.It's true that today's crossovers are far more fuel efficient than the SUVs of a decade ago. But the added height of a crossover carries an automatic fuel efficiency penalty. For example, the new EcoSport gets an EPA-estimated 29 miles per gallon (mpg) on the highway, compared to 34 mpg for the Focus and 35 mpg for the Fiesta. If gas prices continue rising, the superior fuel efficiency of traditional compact cars could become a key selling point again.It's clear that Ford has been building far too many car models in recent years. The same is true for GM. Falling demand for traditional sedans and hatchbacks has undermined the already-tenuous business case for these models.GM has also been suffering from weak demand for traditional sedans. Image source: General Motors.However, eliminating traditional car models doesn't seem sustainable. Entry-level crossovers can't rival the fuel efficiency of a compact or subcompact car, and the difference in price is meaningful for cost-conscious buyers. Adding hybrid or battery-electric crossover models can address fuel-efficiency concerns, but at the cost of making those vehicles even more expensive. (Higher interest rates will make it even harder for consumers to afford the rising cost of buying a new vehicle.)GM is somewhat better-positioned than Ford because it updated the high-volume Chevy Cruze and Chevy Malibu models a couple of years ago. It can keep those models alive for several more years without making major investments.Still, given that Ford will continue making cars for other global regions -- and will build the car-derived Focus Active crossover for the U.S. market -- Ford should have been able to keep selling one or two sedans in the U.S. at an acceptable cost. Instead, it risks exiting a substantial slice of the market just as rising fuel prices and higher interest rates may push consumers back toward affordable, fuel-efficient cars.

But most of all, it’s been a tough road for Ford Motor (NYSE:F). F stock is down a whopping 24% so far this year and more than 20% since early June.Ouch. Now yielding 6.4%, many investors are wondering if Ford is a screaming buy. Combined with a low valuation (although not the lowest in the group), there’s a reason investors are starting to look at Ford. But what do the charts say?We pulled several charts for F stock, including the one, two, three, five and 10-year. With those, we should get a decent idea on what the technical outlook is for Ford. Let’s start from the beginning.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares may be getting a bit exhausted to the downside. As you can see, F stock has fallen from ~$12 to less than $9.50 in only two months. That’s a serious beat down, even if the fundamental story isn’t all that great. Safe Investments to Regularly Earn 12%-Plus Ford is stuck in the midst of a stagnant U.S. auto market. Average selling prices are strong, but there just isn’t any growth. That’s why shares trade at just 7 times this year’s earnings.Wednesday’s candle shows Ford closed well off the lows, despite strong selling pressure in the overall market. Maybe its yield is getting too attractive or perhaps investors feel the fall is overdone. It could be both. Let’s see if shares can rebound and get back over this $9.80 to $10 area.If it can, F stock may have bottomed.Like the one-year chart, the two-year shows how critical of a level $9.80 to $10 is for Ford. Below it and it’s hard to be really bullish at this point, no matter how oversold shares are.The yield is big and worries over global trade wars have put a real negative overhang on the industry. As you can see with the blue circles, the oversold nature of the stock is confirmed by the RSI. However, that’s not a reason to buy on its own. After all, F stock was flashing an oversold condition at $10.60, so it can always go further than investors may first think.It would be much more bullish to see F stock breakout of its downward channel (purple range) and get back above $10. A retest and failure of $10 would be quite bearish though.Given that F stock is below key support, finding the next level is important. Now below its 2016 lows, Ford stock is at risk of falling to $8.75, its 2015 flash-crash low.Does it deserve that? No, but that doesn’t mean it won’t get there. Especially if there’s a broad-market decline. If it does, that would put Ford’s dividend yield near 6.85%.There could be some reprieve in the five-year chart.On the weekly chart above, we can start to see some long-term channels forming and one that shows F stock may have some support in the $9 to $9.25 region. For investors who are snooping for a bottom in Ford, this is likely where I’d start.You can see $8.75 is again highlighted on the chart. Should Ford break below its channel, that’s likely where it’s going.Similar to the five-year chart, the 10-year chart highlights the downward channel that Ford stock is currently in.However, it also shows that the $9 to $9.50 area is a big one from 2012 to 2013. I would love to see this level firm up and act as support, as channel support and level support come together.Further, the weekly RSI levels are highlighted on the top of the chart. F stock now sports its lowest RSI since late-2014. In each instance of these highlights, Ford went on to post a sharp bounce. But remember, this is a weekly chart, so these moves could take time to play out. Additionally, more downside can still exist before the bounce. 7 Alternative Consumer Stocks to Buy With 25% Upside Overall, F stock could be nearing a bottom, but we don’t want to blindly catch the falling knife. Keep these levels handy so you know what to watch for in the coming days, weeks and months.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

But most of all, it’s been a tough road for Ford Motor (NYSE:F). F stock is down a whopping 24% so far this year and more than 20% since early June.Ouch. Now yielding 6.4%, many investors are wondering if Ford is a screaming buy. Combined with a low valuation (although not the lowest in the group), there’s a reason investors are starting to look at Ford. But what do the charts say?We pulled several charts for F stock, including the one, two, three, five and 10-year. With those, we should get a decent idea on what the technical outlook is for Ford. Let’s start from the beginning.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares may be getting a bit exhausted to the downside. As you can see, F stock has fallen from ~$12 to less than $9.50 in only two months. That’s a serious beat down, even if the fundamental story isn’t all that great. Safe Investments to Regularly Earn 12%-Plus Ford is stuck in the midst of a stagnant U.S. auto market. Average selling prices are strong, but there just isn’t any growth. That’s why shares trade at just 7 times this year’s earnings.Wednesday’s candle shows Ford closed well off the lows, despite strong selling pressure in the overall market. Maybe its yield is getting too attractive or perhaps investors feel the fall is overdone. It could be both. Let’s see if shares can rebound and get back over this $9.80 to $10 area.If it can, F stock may have bottomed.Like the one-year chart, the two-year shows how critical of a level $9.80 to $10 is for Ford. Below it and it’s hard to be really bullish at this point, no matter how oversold shares are.The yield is big and worries over global trade wars have put a real negative overhang on the industry. As you can see with the blue circles, the oversold nature of the stock is confirmed by the RSI. However, that’s not a reason to buy on its own. After all, F stock was flashing an oversold condition at $10.60, so it can always go further than investors may first think.It would be much more bullish to see F stock breakout of its downward channel (purple range) and get back above $10. A retest and failure of $10 would be quite bearish though.Given that F stock is below key support, finding the next level is important. Now below its 2016 lows, Ford stock is at risk of falling to $8.75, its 2015 flash-crash low.Does it deserve that? No, but that doesn’t mean it won’t get there. Especially if there’s a broad-market decline. If it does, that would put Ford’s dividend yield near 6.85%.There could be some reprieve in the five-year chart.On the weekly chart above, we can start to see some long-term channels forming and one that shows F stock may have some support in the $9 to $9.25 region. For investors who are snooping for a bottom in Ford, this is likely where I’d start.You can see $8.75 is again highlighted on the chart. Should Ford break below its channel, that’s likely where it’s going.Similar to the five-year chart, the 10-year chart highlights the downward channel that Ford stock is currently in.However, it also shows that the $9 to $9.50 area is a big one from 2012 to 2013. I would love to see this level firm up and act as support, as channel support and level support come together.Further, the weekly RSI levels are highlighted on the top of the chart. F stock now sports its lowest RSI since late-2014. In each instance of these highlights, Ford went on to post a sharp bounce. But remember, this is a weekly chart, so these moves could take time to play out. Additionally, more downside can still exist before the bounce. 7 Alternative Consumer Stocks to Buy With 25% Upside Overall, F stock could be nearing a bottom, but we don’t want to blindly catch the falling knife. Keep these levels handy so you know what to watch for in the coming days, weeks and months.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

It expects to ask shareholders for approval of the transaction this summer.The company has declined to comment on reports that Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) is preparing a rival all-cash offer for the same Fox assets.The new Fox will house assets including Fox News, Fox Business Network and sports cable networks, the company said.James Murdoch currently serves as chairman of Sky PLC (SKYB.L), where he was earlier forced out for four years after a phone-hacking scandal.(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

DIS stock has fluctuated between 96 and 116, and finds itself smack in the middle of that range today.Given all the news around Disney stock, you’d expect bigger trading swings. However, the company’s blockbuster films, ESPN struggles and merger news appear to have largely balanced themselves out.That leaves investors with a dilemma. After a long period of consolidation, is DIS stock finally going to break out, or is it heading back below 100 again? Here are the pros and cons for DIS stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 5 Sin Stocks to Sell Your Soul For Film Division’s Declining Profitability: This isn’t to take anything away from Disney and their success with Black Panther (see below). However, massive box office smashes aren’t generating the sort of long-run income for Disney that they used to.While DVD sales haven’t collapsed as quickly as, say, recorded music revenues, clearly DVDs are on the decline. This showed up in a big way in Disney’s studio revenues last quarter and year.Despite that quarter containing gigantic hits such as Coco, and The Last Jedi, overall revenues fell 1%, hit by weakness in home entertainment and licensing for television. And for full-year 2017, both studio revenues and income fell by more than 10%.While Disney continues to produce popular films, it may not generate the profit margins it once did off them due to changing consumer behavior.Merger With Fox May Create Oversupply: Disney already produces plenty of hit movies. So its rationale for acquiring the films business from Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOXA) seems a little shaky. It’s not like Disney didn’t have enough quality film IP in-house already.And Disney is paying a high price. Fox will end up receiving about 25% of Disney’s outstanding shares in return for selling off their studio assets. Put another way, Disney is paying $66 billion, including the assumption of $13 billion in debt, to add more sports channels and film production to its already powerful place in both areas.Given the problems at ESPN, some would say this is doubling down on a struggling division. In any case, this deal significantly weakens the argument that Disney is a diversified powerhouse, as it will rely much more on just a couple revenue streams for the majority of its profits post-deal.Economically Sensitive Stock: DIS stock is highly exposed to the US economy. While the company is broadly diversified, almost all divisions rely on American consumer spending to remain strong.This is now problematic for two reasons. One, the current economic expansion has continued since 2009. That’s unusually long by historic averages, a recession should be coming soon. And two, with interest rates going up, consumers will find it harder to obtain credit.Instead of saving for trips, many families rely on home equity loans or other consumer credit to finance bigger items such as visits to Disney World. Rising interest rates will make this process less affordable.Ticket Prices Going Up: Many American companies have been complaining about the lack of inflation. Since the financial crisis, consumer prices for various goods have hardly increased at all, limiting profit margins and revenue growth.Disney is not having this problem at its amusement parks. At its lucrative Disneyland Resort in California, one-day peak tickets are going up almost 10% this year, from $124 to $135.Regular one-day tickets are also jumping from $110 to $117. Disney announced price hikes at other parks, including its Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida. Given that parks are Disney’s second-biggest source of revenues, price hikes are a welcome sight for DIS stock.Cheap Stock: DIS stock is currently selling at 18x trailing earnings, making it significantly cheaper than the market as a whole. And as a beneficiary of both the tax overhaul, and substantial merger savings once the Fox deal closes, analysts see that forward PE ratio dropping to under 15x next year. Compared to the S&P 500, that’s nice indeed.And while DIS isn’t thought of as a dividend yield play, it has some merit there as well. Disney’s starting 1.6% yield isn’t eye-catching. However, the board has increased the dividend at a 24% compounded rate over the past five years. Past increases are no guarantee of future growth at that rate.Regardless, Disney is proving that it wants to return profits to its shareholders. DIS could become a dividend powerhouse over time.Black Panther Is A Blockbuster: Disney’s new superhero movie, Black Panther, as an out-of-the-park success. The film generated incredible revenues over the President’s Day weekend. For that stretch, it pulled in $242 million. Only Star Wars: The Force Awakens notched a better figure historically.Including overseas, Black Panther brought in more than $425 million in its first week, ranking it at the top of the superhero pantheon, ahead of the likes of Iron Man and Batman. This is good news for Disney on several fronts.For one, they invested an estimated $200 million in production and $150 million on advertising, so the Black Panther was a big bet. And from a cultural standpoint, this is the biggest opening weekend ever for a movie with a minority cast and director.It’s no secret that Disney leads the way in making movies, still it’s reassuring to find their big bet on this particular film pay off in spades.If you find American stocks to be reasonably priced at this time, than DIS stock may appear attractive. Studio business aside, things are going well, and even there, the company is still producing blockbusters.But the Fox merger comes with significant integration risks. Any deal of that size is transformative, and if it doesn’t work, look out. More broadly, while Disney stock looks cheap compared to the market, remember its business is quite cyclical.When the economy does hit a recession, Disney will underperform its peers. At this point in the economic recovery, I’m not real keen on picking up DIS stock unless it trades below a 15x trailing PE ratio.At the time of this writing, the author had no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

To say that Musk’s behavior has been non-conventional would be a dramatic understatement. His announcement via Twitter on Tuesday that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420/share and had “funding secured” sent the shares skyward from $350 to $380 - although since then speculation about whether and how a deal of that sort might happen and scant details from Musk or Tesla itself about his plan to finance the deal have caused the stock to pull back to $355/share.Tesla’s board of directors issued a brief press release Wednesday confirming that they were in fact considering a proposal to take the company private.What’s Normal?Typically in a situation like this in which a public company was publicizing that they were considering a major corporate action, management would contact the listing exchange and ask for a trading halt so that they could make the appropriate announcement and let the markets digest the information in an orderly fashion before trading resumes. At roughly the same time, the company typically files form 8-K with  the SEC, which is intended to notify investors of a significant event.Musk’s tweet came during market hours with no halt requested until the NASDAQ exchange requested it from the company.The 8-K is posted publicly, allowing the investing public to consider all of the important details of the event and they may include financial statements, press releases, data tables and any other information required to allow the markets to understand the event and decide whether the event should affect the price of the shares.Tesla – like all companies – routinely files form 8-K, even for relatively mundane occurrences like a change in a management position, a change in the terms of company debt or the details of a press release, but so far, no form 8-K seems to have been filed yet regarding the proposed private buyout.Did Musk Violate Securities Laws?In a word, no.  At least it doesn’t seem that way, though he is dancing pretty close to that fire.The SEC decided all the way back in 2013 that social media was a legitimate way for public companies to disseminate information, provided the company formally notifies investors where information will be available. Tesla has complied with these guidelines.There has been much speculation about the phrase “funding secured” all the way down to parsing the semantics of the word “secured” instead of “confirmed” or “committed”, but at the time being, there’s no indication that Musk said anything that is materially false - which would be a violation of securities laws.The laws are generally meant to prohibit “pump and dump” schemes, usually in small stocks, in which an investor with an existing position intentionally disseminates false information and then uses the resulting market reaction to liquidate that position at favorable prices.CNBC commentator and ex-hedge fund manager Jim Cramer – incidentally, no stranger himself to claims of market manipulation – pointed out on Wednesday that in this case “there was no dump.” That is, Musk did not use the rally to sell any of his shares in the company.Merry PranksterThe notoriously confident Musk even continued to taunt those with short positions in Tesla with a prank aimed at famous short seller David Einhorn in which he mailed the hedge-fund manager a box of actual short pants.Einhorn and his firm, Greenlight Capital are probably best known for their outstanding returns during the financial crisis when they correctly surmised that several major investment banks were in trouble and made outsized profits with short positions in those banks.Einhorn, himself a clever individual and semi-pro poker player who often donates his winnings to charity, got in a dig of his own when he replied via Twitter that the shorts “did come with some manufacturing defects,” an obvious reference to reports that Tesla’s Model 3s were being assembled hastily in the push to ramp up production and were consequently of lower quality than the company’s previous Model S and Model X.In a poker analogy, the fact that Musk is light-heartedly joking about the deal and its potential negative effects on short-sellers of the stock would seem to imply that he’s holding a great hand that he’s not showing yet.Or of course it could also be a bluff.Is the Financing “Secured”?That’s the million dollar question. (Actually, it’s the 72 billion dollar question.)Funding for the proposed deal does not have to involve a single buyer or lender committing the full $72 billion dollars. ($72 billion is an estimate, as the actual number of shares involved depends on the exercise of outstanding company stock options and the conversion of convertible debt, but it’s a reasonably close figure.) Given Tesla’s relatively poor credit ratings, a traditional leveraged buyout is unlikely, but there are other ways to make the deal happen.Musk has explained that existing shareholders would be given the choice to tender their shares for $420 in cash, or retain ownership of the same equity stake in a private structure.Tesla would need a majority shareholder vote to approve any deal.  If 100% of existing shareholders chose to retain their stakes in a private entity, the deal could theoretically be done for zero dollars in cash. Musk himself owns approximately 20% of shares and he has stated his intention to retain that position even if the company is taken private. As of the most recent 13-F filings, institutions own another 63% of shares, with the top five holders combining for ownership of approximately 33%. That doesn’t include the Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund, which it was announced this week has acquired almost 5% of Tesla on the open market.In short, Musk would only need the agreement of a handful of existing shareholders, along with their commitment to purchase any tendered shares to gain a majority and truthfully say the financing was “secured.”This is speculation of course, as Tesla and Musk have been tight-lipped so far about the details of their plan. To continue the poker analogy, Musk just shoved a big pile of chips into the middle and dared everyone at the table to make the call. Betting against him certainly hasn’t worked in the past but we’ll have to wait and see for a bit longer to find out how this hand turns out.The only thing we know for sure is that it will be interesting.5 Medical Stocks to Buy Now Zacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

A mere two months after entering a notice of appearance, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius is out as counsel to former Fox News host Andrea Tantaros in her sexual harassment and illegal electronic surveillance suit against the television network and social media pioneer Peter Snyder.Still, that’s practically long-term compared to the tenure of her other lawyer, Tor Ekeland, whose New York-based firm specializes in complex computer and technology cases. He signed on to represent Tantaros on Jan. 16, but will file a notice of withdrawal on Jan. 31, he said in an email. He declined to say why.As first reported by The Hollywood Reporter, Tantaros, who co-hosted the show “Outnumbered,” is now proceeding pro se in the fight.The reason, she wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan on Jan. 29, is “for the simple fact that some stories can only be properly articulated and accurately explained by the ones who have walked in the shoes that have led them down a particularly challenging road. At times, even the finest lawyers in America cannot contextualize exactly what this company has done to so many people, and exactly what has transpired behind the curtain at Fox News.”Morgan Lewis partner Christopher Parlo did not respond to a request for comment, but in a letter to the judge on Jan. 29, he made one thing clear: “Our firm is not the author of and is not counsel on the proposed Amended Complaint or its attachments. We will, however, assist Ms. Tantaros in her transition to pro se status.” You get the sense Parlo didn’t much enjoy his work on the case, which I previously called “a hornet’s nest.” He picked it up after Judd Burstein, who runs a five-lawyer litigation boutique, withdrew in September due to “an irretrievable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.”Soon after Parlo was retained, the Morgan Lewis partner wrote to the judge that “Respectfully, in my nearly 30 years of practice I have never seen a group of lawyers so quick to threaten sanctions against other members of the bar or who would try to use our response to such threats to seek an advantage with this court in other pending motions (and all without giving the court the full background and context).”So who are these sanctions-happy lawyers? Two of the best-known, most-respected litigators in the country, Dechert’s Andrew Levander (named a Litigator of the Year by The American Lawyer in December of 2017) for Fox, and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher litigation practice co-chair Randy Mastro for Snyder and his company Disrupter Inc.But this isn’t a typical case. Reading the court filings, it’s apparent that the defendants are apoplectic—way more than usual—about Tantaros’s allegations.Not so much the sexual harassment part (I mean c’mon, she worked for Fox under Roger Ailes). No. it’s the illegal surveillance and hacking allegations, which also give Tantaros an opening to duck her employment arbitration clause and bring her case in federal court. But she’s got a point that Fox parent News Corp. has crossed lines like these before. Remember the UK phone hacking scandal, where News of the World journalists hacked the phone of celebrities, royalty and murder victims? Or this NPR story, detailing allegations of computer hacking by News America Marketing against competitors including Floorgraphics?Tantaros wrote, “[T]he Defendants’ have resorted to their standard modus operandi of incessant intimidation and hysteria by imposing, threatening and attempting to frighten every lawyer who seeks to illuminate the truth of the illegal behavior which has occurred at Fox News … by seeking the highly atypical, draconian legal tactic of seeking Rule 11 sanctions.”It sounds pretty convincing. Except Tantaros is not a lawyer—she majored in French and journalism—and now she’s representing herself against Levander and Mastro, as well as Thompson & Knight’s Marion Bachrach. David and Goliath is one thing, but this? It’s David versus three Goliaths plus a battalion of Big Law lawyers. Forget “Not guilty.” The best wins are the cases that never get brought. Alas, they often entail scant glory for the lawyers. So in that spirit, I salute Baker Botts partners Michael Goldberg and Russell Lewis for convincing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to close its investigation into the Angolan operations of client Cobalt International Energy without taking action. The SEC began its investigation in March of 2017. According to the Financial Times, the agency was looking into Cobalt’s deal with BP to jointly fund a $350 million research center to be run by Angola’s state oil company which, after five years of payments, still hadn’t materialized. So yes, it’s not terribly difficult to see why this might catch a regulator’s attention. (Ahem, FCPA anyone?) Nor was it Cobalt’s first time under scrutiny. The company was previously investigated by the SEC and the Department of Justice in 2011. The SEC closed that case in 2015 and the DOJ in 2017, both without taking action. Now, Cobalt is off the hook once again, thanks to Baker Botts—at least until next time.Securities Class Actions Hit Record Levels in 2017, Studies Say Cornerstone Research found that three law firms—The Rosen Law Firm and Pomerantz, both in New York, and Los Angeles-based Glancy Prongay & Murray—were driving the increase in filings.

Revenue per lawyer increased by 1.3 percent, to $605,000. Profits per equity partner were up 1.7 percent, reaching $675,000, while net income increased by 3.8 percent.Morris said the firm measures its success more by the average compensation for all partners, which was $569,000, an increase of 3.6 percent from fiscal 2016.(The firm’s final financial results don’t necessarily match estimates reported in the May issue of Legal affiliate The American Lawyer, which collects its data before Fox Rothschild’s year-end.)Head count grew by 6.7 percent, or 47 lawyers, reaching 744. Many of those additions were nonpartners, as the equity partner tier grew by four, to 191, and the nonequity tier by five, to 110.Early in its fiscal year the firm gained a foothold in the Pacific Northwest, absorbing Seattle-based Riddell Williams, a 39-lawyer firm with corporate, employment, financial services, litigation and real estate practices.Aside from that deal, the firm spent much of its energy in 2017 on catching up with its growth from recent years. Fox Rothschild completed its largest-ever merger in January 2016, acquiring 82-lawyer Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly in Minneapolis. It then hired five other partners in Minneapolis and recruited a six-lawyer entertainment team in the Twin Cities and New York. Fox Rothschild’s New York office also brought on a three-lawyer intellectual property group from Kenyon & Kenyon in 2016 and a six-lawyer startup group from Dentons in March 2017. Last year the firm gained new office space in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Los Angeles, and expanded its office in New York. The firm also launched industry initiatives in data privacy and security, gaming, emerging companies and medical technology and devices, Morris said, which required some investment.“We really made headway in sort of completing our integration and getting a handle on the operational aspects of our firm that looks a lot different than it did five years ago,” Morris said. It was helpful that the firm met budget on revenue, he said, adding that the firm also exceeded budget slightly in terms of partner distributions.Morris said the firm raised standard rates modestly, but also saw an uptick in the utilization of alternative fee arrangements.“The firm doesn’t take all of the risk … it’s a sharing of the risk,” he said. “Our CFO and our COO are actively involved in project management. We also involve the department chairs where necessary.”The firm’s strongest practices were intellectual property, tax controversy, entertainment and cybersecurity, Morris said, but no individual matters accounted for their performance. Cybersecurity, in particular, is a growth area, he said, as businesses seek assistance on compliance issues.Meanwhile, he said, bankruptcy was slower, in keeping with industrywide trends. And general commercial litigation was down a little bit, he said, likely because the economy is doing well and parties are less likely to go to trial.Morris said he expects the firm to continue growing, especially in the locations where it already has lawyers. That doesn’t mean the firm won’t expand into new markets, he said, but it will approach those decisions opportunistically. “We think we have an investment now in the infrastructure,” he said. “The way to yield the return on that investment is to add to the offices we have.” He said the firm is always in dialogues with groups about potential combinations, and has spoken to two or three smaller firms recently, but no mergers are imminent. Morris said he also wants to continue improving internal operations and finding ways to be more efficient. The firm will also look for ways to manage its costs in lower-rate practices, he said, but has no plans to abandon work in those areas. Fox Rothschild remains a firm for middle-market clients, but its competition has changed somewhat, Morris said. “I wouldn’t say our competition is all the firms in Philadelphia,” he said. “That’s where it’s changed … now our competition are national firms that have similar clientele.”Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

Smith Moore has four offices in North Carolina, with its largest in Greensboro, as well as an office in Greenville, South Carolina, and one in Atlanta. The firm had 155 lawyers in 2017, according to Legal affiliate The National Law Journal’s NLJ 500, though it appears to be closer to 130 now, based on the firm’s website.While the immediate status of the discussions wasn't clear, one source with knowledge of the talks said a vote on a potential deal had been scheduled at Smith Moore earlier this month, but was postponed. “We’re pretty active in our growth strategy. We are always talking with lawyers and law firms, and until we have something conclusive we don’t comment on those discussions,” Fox Rothschild chairman Mark Silow said Wednesday.Smith Moore managing partner Julianna Theall Earp said she could neither confirm nor deny that any merger talks were taking place.If a deal took place and all of Smith Moore’s lawyers joined Fox Rothschild, it would be the Am Law 100 firm’s biggest acquisition to date. Its largest-ever merger was in 2016 with Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly, an 82-lawyer firm that was based in Minneapolis.Since then, the firm has made several other acquisitions. It merged with 39-lawyer Riddell Williams in Seattle in May 2017, and gained 23 lawyers in Chicago and Wilmington, Delaware, when it acquired Shaw Fishman Glantz & Towbin at the end of May. The firm also completed a small merger last month, when it brought on six lawyers in Denver from Rollin Braswell Fisher. In a recent interview, firmwide managing partner Mark Morris noted that Fox Rothschild does not yet have a presence in Atlanta or the South, and those may be geographic areas of interest to the firm if the right opportunity arose.The firm had gross revenue of $450 million in 2017, and revenue per lawyer of $605,000.Smith Moore has experienced some lateral defections in recent years. According to the NLJ 500, its head count decreased by 16 lawyers, or 9.4 percent, from 2016 to 2017. And in 2018, the firm has lost 21 partners and hired only two, according to ALM’s Legal Compass, which tracks lateral moves at large and midsize firms.That includes a group of three partners and two associates in Charlotte who decamped less than a month ago to join Bradley Arant Boult Cummings, a 500-lawyer, Birmingham-based firm. Among them was Robert Marcus, who had been the partner-in-charge of Smith Moore’s Charlotte office. Marcus told Legal affiliate The American Lawyer in June that Smith Moore had a conflict that kept him from representing Charlotte-based Bank of America Corp., and he was interested in being able to pursue that client at Bradley. Law firm mergers have been frequent in 2018, keeping pace with merger activity in a record-breaking 2017. And those deals have included a number of midsize firms—Altman Weil's Merger Line recently reported that the average size of acquired firms in 2018 was 25 lawyers. In the second quarter of 2018, almost a quarter of announced law firm mergers involved at least one Pennsylvania firm.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

Wait, don't tell us. In fact, if you did win, you may not want to tell anyone other than a trusted attorney.Earlier this year, a Fox Rothschild partner in the suburbs of Philadelphia was called upon to be that attorney for some very lucky clients.According to the Pennsylvania Lottery, an entity called Emerald Legacy Trust in late April claimed a Pennsylvania Lottery Powerball jackpot valued at $456.7 million. The Associated Press reported that Fox Rothschild partner Andrew Santana signed the ticket and claim form along with the trust, opting to receive a $273.9 million cash prize, which comes out to $199.8 million after federal and state taxes.Santana, who is managing partner of Fox Rothschild’s Blue Bell office, said in a statement at the time that he understood the curiosity around the winners' identity, but they intended to remain anonymous.""In order to ensure the winners’ privacy and financial and physical security, we have elected to present the winning Powerball ticket and claim the prize through a trust, for which I am acting as trustee,"" Santana said. ""My clients live and work in small communities in Pennsylvania and desire to maintain normalcy in their daily lives. We strongly believe that maintaining anonymity is critical to ensuring that normalcy.""The jackpot annuity value of $456.7 million actually outweighs Fox Rothschild’s gross revenue for 2017 by several million dollars—the firm reported revenue of $450 million for the year.Santana started at Fox Rothschild as an associate. He was promoted to partner in 2012, and became the Blue Bell managing partner just over two months ago.Andrew SantanaAccording to his firm profile, he works with family businesses and other privately held businesses, entrepreneurs and investors on a variety of issues including corporate, real estate, tax and regulatory matters.The drawing took place March 17, and the winning ticket was purchased at a Speedway in Manheim Township in Lancaster County. The jackpot was the eighth largest in Powerball history, and the largest ever awarded by the Pennsylvania Lottery.According to Lancaster County newspaper LNP, lottery officials have said they were not aware of any other instances in Pennsylvania when a winner used a trust to accept a jackpot anonymously. The Pennsylvania Lottery usually releases the first and last name of the winner, and where they live.As of Wednesday afternoon, the identity of the holder (or holders) of the winning $1.537 billion Mega Millions ticket, which was sold in South Carolina, was unknown. It remains to be seen whether it will stay that way, but if the winner or winners do wish to keep their identities under wraps, they may not need to establish a trust to to do so: South Carolina is one of only a handful of states that give lottery winners the option to remain anonymous.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

The combination went into effect Dec. 3. Raquel Sefton, Casey McNamara and Christopher “Craig” Bridwell joined Fox Rothschild as partners. Joining with them are associates Carlos Ramirez and Sarah Thompson, as well as five professional staff members.Sefton, who was Apex Family Law's managing partner, said her team had become large enough that it wanted the ability to collaborate with lawyers in trusts and estates, tax, corporate, and intellectual property practices.""Being able to bring the practice to a large firm is really helpful for our clients,"" Sefton said. ""Also, it was very attractive to me as the person running the group to be able to take advantage of the economies of scale a larger firm would have.""Raquel Sefton.Sefton said she knew the lawyers in Fox Rothschild's Los Angeles office before the merger. She had previously practiced at Sideman & Bancroft but left the regional firm to form Apex in 2013. Running the practice on its own allowed it to grow more broadly, she said, to the point where becoming part of a national firm seemed like the next logical step.The opportunity to focus more on servicing clients than running a law firm became an attractive prospect too, Sefton said.Fox Rothschild chairman Mark Silow said the addition is in-line with the firm's strategy of growing in its existing offices while adding new locations as well. The firm opened its San Francisco office in 2006 and grew it in 2014 through another merger with six-partner MBV Law. Fox Rothschild now has over 30 lawyers there.The Apex lawyers ""have a very high-end family law practice. They serve a lot of entrepreneurs in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley market,"" Silow said. ""It goes along with another very high-end family law practice we have in Los Angeles that primarily services the entertainment industry.""Silow said the family law group in Los Angeles has created opportunities for work in other practices, but that's not the primary reason for combining with Apex.Sefton said her practice is ""geared toward individuals that have complicated balance sheets or complicated family law issues."" Her rates matched up with Fox Rothschild's ""absolutely perfectly,"" she said, and her clients have all come along in the move.""Sometimes family law practices can be challenging because of the rate structure, but because of the high-end nature of their practice it fit really well,"" Silow said.Fox Rothschild has completed four mergers this year, adding lawyers in the Carolinas, Georgia, Chicago, Delaware and Colorado. The largest of those four combinations, and the firm's largest ever merger, was the acquisition of 130-lawyer Smith Moore Leatherwood, which went into effect Nov. 1.READ MORE:Fox Rothschild to Merge With North Carolina Firm, Gaining 130 LawyersIn Another Merger, Fox Rothschild Adds Six to Denver OfficeFox Rothschild Doubles in Chicago, Grows in Delaware With Shaw Fishman Tie-UpMidsize Firm Leaders Awash in Big Law Merger OffersTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

It expects to ask shareholders for approval of the transaction this summer.The company has declined to comment on reports that Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) is preparing a rival all-cash offer for the same Fox assets.The new Fox will house assets including Fox News, Fox Business Network and sports cable networks, the company said.James Murdoch currently serves as chairman of Sky PLC (SKYB.L), where he was earlier forced out for four years after a phone-hacking scandal.(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

DIS stock has fluctuated between 96 and 116, and finds itself smack in the middle of that range today.Given all the news around Disney stock, you’d expect bigger trading swings. However, the company’s blockbuster films, ESPN struggles and merger news appear to have largely balanced themselves out.That leaves investors with a dilemma. After a long period of consolidation, is DIS stock finally going to break out, or is it heading back below 100 again? Here are the pros and cons for DIS stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 5 Sin Stocks to Sell Your Soul For Film Division’s Declining Profitability: This isn’t to take anything away from Disney and their success with Black Panther (see below). However, massive box office smashes aren’t generating the sort of long-run income for Disney that they used to.While DVD sales haven’t collapsed as quickly as, say, recorded music revenues, clearly DVDs are on the decline. This showed up in a big way in Disney’s studio revenues last quarter and year.Despite that quarter containing gigantic hits such as Coco, and The Last Jedi, overall revenues fell 1%, hit by weakness in home entertainment and licensing for television. And for full-year 2017, both studio revenues and income fell by more than 10%.While Disney continues to produce popular films, it may not generate the profit margins it once did off them due to changing consumer behavior.Merger With Fox May Create Oversupply: Disney already produces plenty of hit movies. So its rationale for acquiring the films business from Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOXA) seems a little shaky. It’s not like Disney didn’t have enough quality film IP in-house already.And Disney is paying a high price. Fox will end up receiving about 25% of Disney’s outstanding shares in return for selling off their studio assets. Put another way, Disney is paying $66 billion, including the assumption of $13 billion in debt, to add more sports channels and film production to its already powerful place in both areas.Given the problems at ESPN, some would say this is doubling down on a struggling division. In any case, this deal significantly weakens the argument that Disney is a diversified powerhouse, as it will rely much more on just a couple revenue streams for the majority of its profits post-deal.Economically Sensitive Stock: DIS stock is highly exposed to the US economy. While the company is broadly diversified, almost all divisions rely on American consumer spending to remain strong.This is now problematic for two reasons. One, the current economic expansion has continued since 2009. That’s unusually long by historic averages, a recession should be coming soon. And two, with interest rates going up, consumers will find it harder to obtain credit.Instead of saving for trips, many families rely on home equity loans or other consumer credit to finance bigger items such as visits to Disney World. Rising interest rates will make this process less affordable.Ticket Prices Going Up: Many American companies have been complaining about the lack of inflation. Since the financial crisis, consumer prices for various goods have hardly increased at all, limiting profit margins and revenue growth.Disney is not having this problem at its amusement parks. At its lucrative Disneyland Resort in California, one-day peak tickets are going up almost 10% this year, from $124 to $135.Regular one-day tickets are also jumping from $110 to $117. Disney announced price hikes at other parks, including its Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida. Given that parks are Disney’s second-biggest source of revenues, price hikes are a welcome sight for DIS stock.Cheap Stock: DIS stock is currently selling at 18x trailing earnings, making it significantly cheaper than the market as a whole. And as a beneficiary of both the tax overhaul, and substantial merger savings once the Fox deal closes, analysts see that forward PE ratio dropping to under 15x next year. Compared to the S&P 500, that’s nice indeed.And while DIS isn’t thought of as a dividend yield play, it has some merit there as well. Disney’s starting 1.6% yield isn’t eye-catching. However, the board has increased the dividend at a 24% compounded rate over the past five years. Past increases are no guarantee of future growth at that rate.Regardless, Disney is proving that it wants to return profits to its shareholders. DIS could become a dividend powerhouse over time.Black Panther Is A Blockbuster: Disney’s new superhero movie, Black Panther, as an out-of-the-park success. The film generated incredible revenues over the President’s Day weekend. For that stretch, it pulled in $242 million. Only Star Wars: The Force Awakens notched a better figure historically.Including overseas, Black Panther brought in more than $425 million in its first week, ranking it at the top of the superhero pantheon, ahead of the likes of Iron Man and Batman. This is good news for Disney on several fronts.For one, they invested an estimated $200 million in production and $150 million on advertising, so the Black Panther was a big bet. And from a cultural standpoint, this is the biggest opening weekend ever for a movie with a minority cast and director.It’s no secret that Disney leads the way in making movies, still it’s reassuring to find their big bet on this particular film pay off in spades.If you find American stocks to be reasonably priced at this time, than DIS stock may appear attractive. Studio business aside, things are going well, and even there, the company is still producing blockbusters.But the Fox merger comes with significant integration risks. Any deal of that size is transformative, and if it doesn’t work, look out. More broadly, while Disney stock looks cheap compared to the market, remember its business is quite cyclical.When the economy does hit a recession, Disney will underperform its peers. At this point in the economic recovery, I’m not real keen on picking up DIS stock unless it trades below a 15x trailing PE ratio.At the time of this writing, the author had no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

To say that Musk’s behavior has been non-conventional would be a dramatic understatement. His announcement via Twitter on Tuesday that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420/share and had “funding secured” sent the shares skyward from $350 to $380 - although since then speculation about whether and how a deal of that sort might happen and scant details from Musk or Tesla itself about his plan to finance the deal have caused the stock to pull back to $355/share.Tesla’s board of directors issued a brief press release Wednesday confirming that they were in fact considering a proposal to take the company private.What’s Normal?Typically in a situation like this in which a public company was publicizing that they were considering a major corporate action, management would contact the listing exchange and ask for a trading halt so that they could make the appropriate announcement and let the markets digest the information in an orderly fashion before trading resumes. At roughly the same time, the company typically files form 8-K with  the SEC, which is intended to notify investors of a significant event.Musk’s tweet came during market hours with no halt requested until the NASDAQ exchange requested it from the company.The 8-K is posted publicly, allowing the investing public to consider all of the important details of the event and they may include financial statements, press releases, data tables and any other information required to allow the markets to understand the event and decide whether the event should affect the price of the shares.Tesla – like all companies – routinely files form 8-K, even for relatively mundane occurrences like a change in a management position, a change in the terms of company debt or the details of a press release, but so far, no form 8-K seems to have been filed yet regarding the proposed private buyout.Did Musk Violate Securities Laws?In a word, no.  At least it doesn’t seem that way, though he is dancing pretty close to that fire.The SEC decided all the way back in 2013 that social media was a legitimate way for public companies to disseminate information, provided the company formally notifies investors where information will be available. Tesla has complied with these guidelines.There has been much speculation about the phrase “funding secured” all the way down to parsing the semantics of the word “secured” instead of “confirmed” or “committed”, but at the time being, there’s no indication that Musk said anything that is materially false - which would be a violation of securities laws.The laws are generally meant to prohibit “pump and dump” schemes, usually in small stocks, in which an investor with an existing position intentionally disseminates false information and then uses the resulting market reaction to liquidate that position at favorable prices.CNBC commentator and ex-hedge fund manager Jim Cramer – incidentally, no stranger himself to claims of market manipulation – pointed out on Wednesday that in this case “there was no dump.” That is, Musk did not use the rally to sell any of his shares in the company.Merry PranksterThe notoriously confident Musk even continued to taunt those with short positions in Tesla with a prank aimed at famous short seller David Einhorn in which he mailed the hedge-fund manager a box of actual short pants.Einhorn and his firm, Greenlight Capital are probably best known for their outstanding returns during the financial crisis when they correctly surmised that several major investment banks were in trouble and made outsized profits with short positions in those banks.Einhorn, himself a clever individual and semi-pro poker player who often donates his winnings to charity, got in a dig of his own when he replied via Twitter that the shorts “did come with some manufacturing defects,” an obvious reference to reports that Tesla’s Model 3s were being assembled hastily in the push to ramp up production and were consequently of lower quality than the company’s previous Model S and Model X.In a poker analogy, the fact that Musk is light-heartedly joking about the deal and its potential negative effects on short-sellers of the stock would seem to imply that he’s holding a great hand that he’s not showing yet.Or of course it could also be a bluff.Is the Financing “Secured”?That’s the million dollar question. (Actually, it’s the 72 billion dollar question.)Funding for the proposed deal does not have to involve a single buyer or lender committing the full $72 billion dollars. ($72 billion is an estimate, as the actual number of shares involved depends on the exercise of outstanding company stock options and the conversion of convertible debt, but it’s a reasonably close figure.) Given Tesla’s relatively poor credit ratings, a traditional leveraged buyout is unlikely, but there are other ways to make the deal happen.Musk has explained that existing shareholders would be given the choice to tender their shares for $420 in cash, or retain ownership of the same equity stake in a private structure.Tesla would need a majority shareholder vote to approve any deal.  If 100% of existing shareholders chose to retain their stakes in a private entity, the deal could theoretically be done for zero dollars in cash. Musk himself owns approximately 20% of shares and he has stated his intention to retain that position even if the company is taken private. As of the most recent 13-F filings, institutions own another 63% of shares, with the top five holders combining for ownership of approximately 33%. That doesn’t include the Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund, which it was announced this week has acquired almost 5% of Tesla on the open market.In short, Musk would only need the agreement of a handful of existing shareholders, along with their commitment to purchase any tendered shares to gain a majority and truthfully say the financing was “secured.”This is speculation of course, as Tesla and Musk have been tight-lipped so far about the details of their plan. To continue the poker analogy, Musk just shoved a big pile of chips into the middle and dared everyone at the table to make the call. Betting against him certainly hasn’t worked in the past but we’ll have to wait and see for a bit longer to find out how this hand turns out.The only thing we know for sure is that it will be interesting.5 Medical Stocks to Buy Now Zacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

A mere two months after entering a notice of appearance, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius is out as counsel to former Fox News host Andrea Tantaros in her sexual harassment and illegal electronic surveillance suit against the television network and social media pioneer Peter Snyder.Still, that’s practically long-term compared to the tenure of her other lawyer, Tor Ekeland, whose New York-based firm specializes in complex computer and technology cases. He signed on to represent Tantaros on Jan. 16, but will file a notice of withdrawal on Jan. 31, he said in an email. He declined to say why.As first reported by The Hollywood Reporter, Tantaros, who co-hosted the show “Outnumbered,” is now proceeding pro se in the fight.The reason, she wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan on Jan. 29, is “for the simple fact that some stories can only be properly articulated and accurately explained by the ones who have walked in the shoes that have led them down a particularly challenging road. At times, even the finest lawyers in America cannot contextualize exactly what this company has done to so many people, and exactly what has transpired behind the curtain at Fox News.”Morgan Lewis partner Christopher Parlo did not respond to a request for comment, but in a letter to the judge on Jan. 29, he made one thing clear: “Our firm is not the author of and is not counsel on the proposed Amended Complaint or its attachments. We will, however, assist Ms. Tantaros in her transition to pro se status.” You get the sense Parlo didn’t much enjoy his work on the case, which I previously called “a hornet’s nest.” He picked it up after Judd Burstein, who runs a five-lawyer litigation boutique, withdrew in September due to “an irretrievable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.”Soon after Parlo was retained, the Morgan Lewis partner wrote to the judge that “Respectfully, in my nearly 30 years of practice I have never seen a group of lawyers so quick to threaten sanctions against other members of the bar or who would try to use our response to such threats to seek an advantage with this court in other pending motions (and all without giving the court the full background and context).”So who are these sanctions-happy lawyers? Two of the best-known, most-respected litigators in the country, Dechert’s Andrew Levander (named a Litigator of the Year by The American Lawyer in December of 2017) for Fox, and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher litigation practice co-chair Randy Mastro for Snyder and his company Disrupter Inc.But this isn’t a typical case. Reading the court filings, it’s apparent that the defendants are apoplectic—way more than usual—about Tantaros’s allegations.Not so much the sexual harassment part (I mean c’mon, she worked for Fox under Roger Ailes). No. it’s the illegal surveillance and hacking allegations, which also give Tantaros an opening to duck her employment arbitration clause and bring her case in federal court. But she’s got a point that Fox parent News Corp. has crossed lines like these before. Remember the UK phone hacking scandal, where News of the World journalists hacked the phone of celebrities, royalty and murder victims? Or this NPR story, detailing allegations of computer hacking by News America Marketing against competitors including Floorgraphics?Tantaros wrote, “[T]he Defendants’ have resorted to their standard modus operandi of incessant intimidation and hysteria by imposing, threatening and attempting to frighten every lawyer who seeks to illuminate the truth of the illegal behavior which has occurred at Fox News … by seeking the highly atypical, draconian legal tactic of seeking Rule 11 sanctions.”It sounds pretty convincing. Except Tantaros is not a lawyer—she majored in French and journalism—and now she’s representing herself against Levander and Mastro, as well as Thompson & Knight’s Marion Bachrach. David and Goliath is one thing, but this? It’s David versus three Goliaths plus a battalion of Big Law lawyers. Forget “Not guilty.” The best wins are the cases that never get brought. Alas, they often entail scant glory for the lawyers. So in that spirit, I salute Baker Botts partners Michael Goldberg and Russell Lewis for convincing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to close its investigation into the Angolan operations of client Cobalt International Energy without taking action. The SEC began its investigation in March of 2017. According to the Financial Times, the agency was looking into Cobalt’s deal with BP to jointly fund a $350 million research center to be run by Angola’s state oil company which, after five years of payments, still hadn’t materialized. So yes, it’s not terribly difficult to see why this might catch a regulator’s attention. (Ahem, FCPA anyone?) Nor was it Cobalt’s first time under scrutiny. The company was previously investigated by the SEC and the Department of Justice in 2011. The SEC closed that case in 2015 and the DOJ in 2017, both without taking action. Now, Cobalt is off the hook once again, thanks to Baker Botts—at least until next time.Securities Class Actions Hit Record Levels in 2017, Studies Say Cornerstone Research found that three law firms—The Rosen Law Firm and Pomerantz, both in New York, and Los Angeles-based Glancy Prongay & Murray—were driving the increase in filings.

Revenue per lawyer increased by 1.3 percent, to $605,000. Profits per equity partner were up 1.7 percent, reaching $675,000, while net income increased by 3.8 percent.Morris said the firm measures its success more by the average compensation for all partners, which was $569,000, an increase of 3.6 percent from fiscal 2016.(The firm’s final financial results don’t necessarily match estimates reported in the May issue of Legal affiliate The American Lawyer, which collects its data before Fox Rothschild’s year-end.)Head count grew by 6.7 percent, or 47 lawyers, reaching 744. Many of those additions were nonpartners, as the equity partner tier grew by four, to 191, and the nonequity tier by five, to 110.Early in its fiscal year the firm gained a foothold in the Pacific Northwest, absorbing Seattle-based Riddell Williams, a 39-lawyer firm with corporate, employment, financial services, litigation and real estate practices.Aside from that deal, the firm spent much of its energy in 2017 on catching up with its growth from recent years. Fox Rothschild completed its largest-ever merger in January 2016, acquiring 82-lawyer Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly in Minneapolis. It then hired five other partners in Minneapolis and recruited a six-lawyer entertainment team in the Twin Cities and New York. Fox Rothschild’s New York office also brought on a three-lawyer intellectual property group from Kenyon & Kenyon in 2016 and a six-lawyer startup group from Dentons in March 2017. Last year the firm gained new office space in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Los Angeles, and expanded its office in New York. The firm also launched industry initiatives in data privacy and security, gaming, emerging companies and medical technology and devices, Morris said, which required some investment.“We really made headway in sort of completing our integration and getting a handle on the operational aspects of our firm that looks a lot different than it did five years ago,” Morris said. It was helpful that the firm met budget on revenue, he said, adding that the firm also exceeded budget slightly in terms of partner distributions.Morris said the firm raised standard rates modestly, but also saw an uptick in the utilization of alternative fee arrangements.“The firm doesn’t take all of the risk … it’s a sharing of the risk,” he said. “Our CFO and our COO are actively involved in project management. We also involve the department chairs where necessary.”The firm’s strongest practices were intellectual property, tax controversy, entertainment and cybersecurity, Morris said, but no individual matters accounted for their performance. Cybersecurity, in particular, is a growth area, he said, as businesses seek assistance on compliance issues.Meanwhile, he said, bankruptcy was slower, in keeping with industrywide trends. And general commercial litigation was down a little bit, he said, likely because the economy is doing well and parties are less likely to go to trial.Morris said he expects the firm to continue growing, especially in the locations where it already has lawyers. That doesn’t mean the firm won’t expand into new markets, he said, but it will approach those decisions opportunistically. “We think we have an investment now in the infrastructure,” he said. “The way to yield the return on that investment is to add to the offices we have.” He said the firm is always in dialogues with groups about potential combinations, and has spoken to two or three smaller firms recently, but no mergers are imminent. Morris said he also wants to continue improving internal operations and finding ways to be more efficient. The firm will also look for ways to manage its costs in lower-rate practices, he said, but has no plans to abandon work in those areas. Fox Rothschild remains a firm for middle-market clients, but its competition has changed somewhat, Morris said. “I wouldn’t say our competition is all the firms in Philadelphia,” he said. “That’s where it’s changed … now our competition are national firms that have similar clientele.”Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

Smith Moore has four offices in North Carolina, with its largest in Greensboro, as well as an office in Greenville, South Carolina, and one in Atlanta. The firm had 155 lawyers in 2017, according to Legal affiliate The National Law Journal’s NLJ 500, though it appears to be closer to 130 now, based on the firm’s website.While the immediate status of the discussions wasn't clear, one source with knowledge of the talks said a vote on a potential deal had been scheduled at Smith Moore earlier this month, but was postponed. “We’re pretty active in our growth strategy. We are always talking with lawyers and law firms, and until we have something conclusive we don’t comment on those discussions,” Fox Rothschild chairman Mark Silow said Wednesday.Smith Moore managing partner Julianna Theall Earp said she could neither confirm nor deny that any merger talks were taking place.If a deal took place and all of Smith Moore’s lawyers joined Fox Rothschild, it would be the Am Law 100 firm’s biggest acquisition to date. Its largest-ever merger was in 2016 with Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly, an 82-lawyer firm that was based in Minneapolis.Since then, the firm has made several other acquisitions. It merged with 39-lawyer Riddell Williams in Seattle in May 2017, and gained 23 lawyers in Chicago and Wilmington, Delaware, when it acquired Shaw Fishman Glantz & Towbin at the end of May. The firm also completed a small merger last month, when it brought on six lawyers in Denver from Rollin Braswell Fisher. In a recent interview, firmwide managing partner Mark Morris noted that Fox Rothschild does not yet have a presence in Atlanta or the South, and those may be geographic areas of interest to the firm if the right opportunity arose.The firm had gross revenue of $450 million in 2017, and revenue per lawyer of $605,000.Smith Moore has experienced some lateral defections in recent years. According to the NLJ 500, its head count decreased by 16 lawyers, or 9.4 percent, from 2016 to 2017. And in 2018, the firm has lost 21 partners and hired only two, according to ALM’s Legal Compass, which tracks lateral moves at large and midsize firms.That includes a group of three partners and two associates in Charlotte who decamped less than a month ago to join Bradley Arant Boult Cummings, a 500-lawyer, Birmingham-based firm. Among them was Robert Marcus, who had been the partner-in-charge of Smith Moore’s Charlotte office. Marcus told Legal affiliate The American Lawyer in June that Smith Moore had a conflict that kept him from representing Charlotte-based Bank of America Corp., and he was interested in being able to pursue that client at Bradley. Law firm mergers have been frequent in 2018, keeping pace with merger activity in a record-breaking 2017. And those deals have included a number of midsize firms—Altman Weil's Merger Line recently reported that the average size of acquired firms in 2018 was 25 lawyers. In the second quarter of 2018, almost a quarter of announced law firm mergers involved at least one Pennsylvania firm.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

Wait, don't tell us. In fact, if you did win, you may not want to tell anyone other than a trusted attorney.Earlier this year, a Fox Rothschild partner in the suburbs of Philadelphia was called upon to be that attorney for some very lucky clients.According to the Pennsylvania Lottery, an entity called Emerald Legacy Trust in late April claimed a Pennsylvania Lottery Powerball jackpot valued at $456.7 million. The Associated Press reported that Fox Rothschild partner Andrew Santana signed the ticket and claim form along with the trust, opting to receive a $273.9 million cash prize, which comes out to $199.8 million after federal and state taxes.Santana, who is managing partner of Fox Rothschild’s Blue Bell office, said in a statement at the time that he understood the curiosity around the winners' identity, but they intended to remain anonymous.""In order to ensure the winners’ privacy and financial and physical security, we have elected to present the winning Powerball ticket and claim the prize through a trust, for which I am acting as trustee,"" Santana said. ""My clients live and work in small communities in Pennsylvania and desire to maintain normalcy in their daily lives. We strongly believe that maintaining anonymity is critical to ensuring that normalcy.""The jackpot annuity value of $456.7 million actually outweighs Fox Rothschild’s gross revenue for 2017 by several million dollars—the firm reported revenue of $450 million for the year.Santana started at Fox Rothschild as an associate. He was promoted to partner in 2012, and became the Blue Bell managing partner just over two months ago.Andrew SantanaAccording to his firm profile, he works with family businesses and other privately held businesses, entrepreneurs and investors on a variety of issues including corporate, real estate, tax and regulatory matters.The drawing took place March 17, and the winning ticket was purchased at a Speedway in Manheim Township in Lancaster County. The jackpot was the eighth largest in Powerball history, and the largest ever awarded by the Pennsylvania Lottery.According to Lancaster County newspaper LNP, lottery officials have said they were not aware of any other instances in Pennsylvania when a winner used a trust to accept a jackpot anonymously. The Pennsylvania Lottery usually releases the first and last name of the winner, and where they live.As of Wednesday afternoon, the identity of the holder (or holders) of the winning $1.537 billion Mega Millions ticket, which was sold in South Carolina, was unknown. It remains to be seen whether it will stay that way, but if the winner or winners do wish to keep their identities under wraps, they may not need to establish a trust to to do so: South Carolina is one of only a handful of states that give lottery winners the option to remain anonymous.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

The combination went into effect Dec. 3. Raquel Sefton, Casey McNamara and Christopher “Craig” Bridwell joined Fox Rothschild as partners. Joining with them are associates Carlos Ramirez and Sarah Thompson, as well as five professional staff members.Sefton, who was Apex Family Law's managing partner, said her team had become large enough that it wanted the ability to collaborate with lawyers in trusts and estates, tax, corporate, and intellectual property practices.""Being able to bring the practice to a large firm is really helpful for our clients,"" Sefton said. ""Also, it was very attractive to me as the person running the group to be able to take advantage of the economies of scale a larger firm would have.""Raquel Sefton.Sefton said she knew the lawyers in Fox Rothschild's Los Angeles office before the merger. She had previously practiced at Sideman & Bancroft but left the regional firm to form Apex in 2013. Running the practice on its own allowed it to grow more broadly, she said, to the point where becoming part of a national firm seemed like the next logical step.The opportunity to focus more on servicing clients than running a law firm became an attractive prospect too, Sefton said.Fox Rothschild chairman Mark Silow said the addition is in-line with the firm's strategy of growing in its existing offices while adding new locations as well. The firm opened its San Francisco office in 2006 and grew it in 2014 through another merger with six-partner MBV Law. Fox Rothschild now has over 30 lawyers there.The Apex lawyers ""have a very high-end family law practice. They serve a lot of entrepreneurs in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley market,"" Silow said. ""It goes along with another very high-end family law practice we have in Los Angeles that primarily services the entertainment industry.""Silow said the family law group in Los Angeles has created opportunities for work in other practices, but that's not the primary reason for combining with Apex.Sefton said her practice is ""geared toward individuals that have complicated balance sheets or complicated family law issues."" Her rates matched up with Fox Rothschild's ""absolutely perfectly,"" she said, and her clients have all come along in the move.""Sometimes family law practices can be challenging because of the rate structure, but because of the high-end nature of their practice it fit really well,"" Silow said.Fox Rothschild has completed four mergers this year, adding lawyers in the Carolinas, Georgia, Chicago, Delaware and Colorado. The largest of those four combinations, and the firm's largest ever merger, was the acquisition of 130-lawyer Smith Moore Leatherwood, which went into effect Nov. 1.READ MORE:Fox Rothschild to Merge With North Carolina Firm, Gaining 130 LawyersIn Another Merger, Fox Rothschild Adds Six to Denver OfficeFox Rothschild Doubles in Chicago, Grows in Delaware With Shaw Fishman Tie-UpMidsize Firm Leaders Awash in Big Law Merger OffersTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

The widely followed index pulled back 4.1% in just one day, its biggest single-day decline since August 2011.This caught many investors off guard as stocks began the new year ripping higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were enjoying their best monthly gains since March 2016.Did this lofty stock market really run up too fast? By one Kiplinger measure, this bull market is the second-longest one on record. After a stellar 2017, 2018 was also off to a fast start before Monday’s trading session erased gains.

Even as competitors like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) step up their online retail operations with new initiatives and acquisitions, Amazon continues to widen the gap between itself and everyone else. $0.43 of every dollar spent shopping online in the United States during 2018 will go to Amazon.com, according to eMarketer.It's one thing to see the gap in sales volume increasing; it's another to understand what exactly Amazon is doing to make that happen. Many point to the success of Prime as a reason Amazon is winning a larger share of online sales. But a survey from Feedvisor indicates Amazon is succeeding because it makes it easy for shoppers to find the information they're looking for versus its biggest competitors.Image source: Amazon.Feedvisor asked 1,500 online shoppers which of the following platforms is most helpful in certain situations: Amazon, Walmart.com, Jet.com (owned by Wal-Mart), eBay, or Alibaba.From finding new products, to discovering deals, to price and shipping information comparisons, Amazon was by far the most popular choice. 70% to 80% of respondents chose Amazon.com for every question. Walmart.com and eBay each usually took percentages in the high teens and low twenties. Jet.com and Alibaba typically garnered favor from a low single-digit percentage of respondents.Image source: Author, data source: Feedvisor.Amazon simply provides a better user experience than its competitors with aggregated listings, user reviews, and built-in product comparisons. It's no wonder millennials consider the Amazon app one of their must-have apps on their phone. It makes using Amazon for price comparisons or to look up more information on a product extremely easy.By presenting more information to its visitors about products, Amazon is able to attract a lot more visitors. That's what those survey results really mean. And attracting more visitors to the website is a surefire way to increase sales.Price comparison is the most popular reason for visiting Amazon.com, whether the shopper is a Prime member or not, and whether they have intent to buy now or are just considering a purchase. 75% of shoppers check Amazon for pricing either ""always"" or ""often"" before making a purchase somewhere else, according to the Feedvisor survey.Amazon doesn't always have the lowest prices. But you can be sure Amazon knows what its competitors' prices are and which products shoppers will check prices on most. Amazon can make its prices more competitive on those products while producing wider margins on less competitive items and private-label goods.Amazon is also actively expanding the number of items that are Prime eligible, which can be a determining factor when a customer is deciding whether to purchase from Amazon.com. 80% of shoppers said Amazon is most helpful in determining shipping speed (likely because of Prime), and 31% say a product that's Prime eligible makes them more likely to buy it from Amazon.Amazon recently announced it now has over 100 million Prime-eligible items for sale on its website. That's up from 50 million at the beginning of 2017.By offering shoppers more information, Amazon is able to attract more visitors. Using its data, it can optimize pricing and attract new third-party merchants to make more items Prime eligible. The foundation of driving traffic and collecting data is what's driving Amazon's sales growth, and it will continue to help Amazon widen the gap between itself and its competitors.

Whether house hunters click through Zillow and Redfin listings or are sent customized MLS listings by their realtor, people typically have to coordinate with a realtor and physically present themselves at properties in order to see anything more than a handful of dimly lit, grainy photos showing just a glimpse of a room or two. But house hunters want more. According to one online poll [cite Harris Poll for Coldwell Banker Real Estate from December 5-7, 2017], 77% of US consumers would like the ability to take home tours in virtual reality.Yamen Darwish, a 23 year-old startup founder from Brooklyn, New York, noticed this gap in real estate technology. Yamen is the Founder of VRmello, Corp., a cloud-based real estate brokerage platform helping people buy and sell homes in a very non-traditional way. He describes VRmello as a real estate corporate office and showroom existing entirely in virtual reality. ""Think of it as a 24/7 open house for properties around the globe,"" he says. ""Home buyers can browse through property listings, engage agents, and conduct escrow all from the comfort of their office - or sofa.""""The convenience of conducting real estate transactions doesn’t stop with the home buyer,"" Yamen explains, ""but extends to people looking to sell their homes, with little effort, to a more global marketplace."" Indeed, according to Yamen, once home sellers sign up on VRmello.com and select their realtor from online profile listings of local VRmello-affiliated realtors, VRmello takes over from there, doing everything from capturing virtual reality home tours, to chatting online with potential buyers from nearby - or from across the globe.Yamen's diverse beginnings working with real estate ventures in Los Angeles, New York City and Dubai and his connections within those markets--are what inspired him to think big. That momentum has been aided by seed funding from key players in varied industries, including from movie production giant Randall Emmett. VRmello is scheduled to launch as early as Winter 2018.

So that's why I think this (trend) is a positive shift,"" Santaniello said.The back-to-school sales period is the busiest shopping season behind the year-end holidays, and can contribute a third of profits for retailers.Shoppers will be doling out an average of $284 on clothing and shoes compared with $186 on electronics, a 28 percent increase over last year, according to a survey by RetailMeNot Inc, a website that tracks coupons and promotions at major retail brands.Deloitte's annual back-to-school survey shows that shoppers will spend more on clothes and accessories, about $15 billion or 55 percent of the total $27.6 billion expected to be spent. https://bit.ly/2tfYgGxRetailers are in a pretty good spot, especially in North America, where the economy is healthier than a year ago, NPD's lead retail analyst Marshall Cohen said.(Click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2MrWMCu for an interactive on back-to-school quarter performance of apparel retailers)OLD BECOMES NEW AGAINAmerican Eagle's global brand president Chad Kessler said it is bit of an evolution, with high-rise mom jeans and crop tops influencing shoppers this year.""I do think the 90s are a big influence,"" Kessler said.Because Urban Outfitters targets both adults and young shoppers, with its Anthropologie and namesake stores, BlueFin Research analyst Rebecca Duval said she expects the company to be one of the strongest brands this season along with Gap Inc (GPS.N).Urban Outfitters is expected to post same-store sales growth of 5.6 percent in the third quarter, while American Eagle could report a 4.6 percent rise, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data, marking the best growth in three years.Although Gap and Nordstrom are not expected to show the same same-store sales growth, overall sales for the four retailers are expected to be the highest in at least four years.U.S. apparel retailers struggled after millennials, born between 1986 and 1996, switched to fast-fashion trends from European labels like H&M (HMb.ST) and Inditex's (ITX.MC) Zara.The shift forced retailers to diversify inventory and rely less on once popular logo emblazoned apparel.Social media is also having an impact, with retailers using the medium to market and rope in younger buyers.""Every twenty years fashion comes back ... You stay away from something long enough and you crave it,"" Vanessa Valiente, personal stylist and the creator of fashion blog V-Style, said.(Reporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr)Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

First came the spotlight on the Silicon Valley gender gap. Then Harvey Weinstein and the #MeToo movement inspired a corporate reckoning that has led to high-profile firings and lawsuits. But even in a climate of outrage, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe partners Lynne Hermle and Jessica Perry defeated class actions against Microsoft Corp. and Twitter Inc. that alleged the companies pay and promotion practices penalized women. For that we recognize the Orrick team as our litigators of the week. In the span of less than two weeks, separate judges in California and Washington denied motions to certify classes in the suits against both Microsoft and Twitter, essentially extinguishing cases that had been seen as a barometer for gender bias litigation in the tech industry. The Microsoft lawsuit sought to certify a class of more than 8,600 women and the Twitter case 130. Ultimately, the judges were not convinced that a common hiring practice or standard led to unequal promotion or pay among female workers at the company. “Class certification is a big event in a case like this. It’s the most important one. You are constantly thinking of evidence and what it’s showing along the way,” Perry said in an interview Thursday. “As we got into the cases, it became clear that the theories they were pursuing weren’t born out through in the evidence.” Hermle agreed. “At the end of the day, the facts and the law clearly showed neither case should be certified,” Hermle said. “After so many years of litigation, we were pleased to see the judges dig into the voluminous record and thoughtfully analyze the issues to get to the right result.” Hermle, an employment litigator whose stature rose after her 2015 trial win for Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, argued against class certification. Perry, a Menlo Park, California-based employment partner and leader of the firm’s litigation practices worldwide, was second chair. Both have taken on cases defending major clients in the tech sector. Hermle, who’s also based in Menlo Park, has said she planned to become a plaintiffs-side employment lawyer after graduating from law school but got a nudge into defense-side work and “never looked back.” “I work with amazing clients, most of whom have great in-house counsel. I’m able to push for settlements and change when needed,” Hermle said in a 2015 interview with The Recorder, a Litigation Daily affiliate. “I lead a team of 10 tough women and serve on the management committee at Orrick, a firm with three women partners on the board.” (That team, according to an Orrick representative, now includes 12 women. Hermle has since joined the firm's board.) In the lawsuit against Microsoft, a class of more than 8,600 former and current female employees sought to join together, claiming the company’s pay and promotion practices favored men. The workers are represented by a team from Outten & Golden and Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein. U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Washington federal court in Seattle denied class certification on June 25, ruling a uniform policy for pay and promotion did not tie the women together. The case against Twitter centered around only promotion practices, and attorneys argued for a class of about 130 female engineers to join the lawsuit, which claimed that a “boys club” culture enabled an unfair promotion system. Jason Lohr of San Francisco’s Lohr Ripamonti & Segarich represents the employees. Ruling July 3, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Mary Wiss denied class certification on grounds that there was not enough commonality or a uniform reason for a disparity. Perry said the cases, both filed in 2015, had similarities and overlapping themes. Both cases ultimately collapsed under the weight of Walmart v. Dukes, because plaintiffs were unable to tie an alleged gender disparity to specific or uniform policies at the companies. During oral argument in the Microsoft case, Robart telegraphed a likely win for the Orrick attorneys. Lieff Cabraser partner Kelly Dermody told the judge that Microsoft managers weren’t following uniform guidance in their decisions to promote or pay employees. The judge said that admission drove “a wooden stake through the heart” of her argument. In addition to the Microsoft and Twitter cases, lawsuits targeting gender bias are ongoing against other tech giants, including Google and Oracle. A lawsuit against Uber Technologies recently settled. Hermle said she expects plaintiffs will continue to press cases targeting pay and promotion practices. She said the Twitter and Microsoft cases could be instructive for the discrimination litigation landscape moving forward. “I think the courts recognize that class actions simply are not an appropriate vehicle for highly individualized discrimination claims. There are some situations where a disparate impact theory may be the appropriate vehicle, like if there is a testing requirement that screens out certain candidates—a height or weight requirement for example, but it isn’t the right vehicle when you are dealing with individual managers evaluating job performance in light of unique roles and different contributions.” Hermle said her background defending other major companies in Silicon Valley helped shape her approach to defending Microsoft and Twitter. She said understanding the pace of innovation and type of work done by engineers, for example, gave her team a leg up in explaining the companies' performance management systems and how decisions are actually made. She added that with litigation on these issues, she has seen a concerted effort by clients to enhance policies and practices to promote recruitment, retention and advancement of women—despite the challenges in the pipeline. “So, I think there’s real change happening,” Hermle said. “But it’s not happening through meritless suits.”Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

(NYSE:AZO) fell by as much as 10% on the earnings miss. However, for AutoZone stock investors, missing estimates may become the least of their problems. AZO’s debt burden and unpaid liabilities pose a danger to the stock.Even worse, management’s preference for stock buybacks could create issues for the company and its investors alike. Until the company’s balance sheet improves, investors should avoid AutoZone stock.The company reported earnings for the second quarter of 2018 of $8.47 per share. This missed consensus by 46 cents per share. Revenues of $2.41 billion beat estimates by $20 million and resulted in 5.2% growth from year-ago levels. Although earnings showed a 9.3% increase on a year-over-year basis, Wall Street did not take the news well, and the stock sold off in morning trading.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever The company’s problems remain unrelated to its industry. Auto parts sales serve as a profitable revenue source for investors. The industry’s recession-proof nature also keeps revenues reliable. Although Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has entered the market, a reluctance to wait on parts reduces the threat Amazon can pose.This serves AutoZone stock and its peers well. Moreover, the average age of cars has risen to 11.6 years. Since older cars more often need new parts, the aging of vehicles works in AZO’s favor. Still, since customers can also turn to peers such as Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC), and O’Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY), store coverage remains essential. The company added 216 stores over the last year to bring its latest store count to 6,088. Hence, coverage continues improving.AutoZone stock also remains cheap. The equity trades at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 15. This is lower than its three main competitors. Also, of its direct peers, only GPC showed a higher level of sales growth in the previous quarter.Unfortunately for AutoZone stock investors, the equity appears to hold a low valuation for a reason. As I mentioned after the previous quarterly earnings report, the current ratio remains a concern. Once again, the company’s current liabilities exceed the value of its current assets. The gap between current assets and liabilities narrowed from the last quarter. It stands at about $1.2 billion now. The book value also remains negative, coming in at -$1.565 billion. And as in the last quarter, the debt and accounts payable liabilities almost match the value of the company’s total assets.Decisions at the top are the likely reason for the negative book value. AutoZone’s leaders appear to prioritize stock buybacks over the company’s financial stability. Shares outstanding fell to 27.35 million, down from 27.49 million. The buybacks seem to have had little long-term impact. With the fall in the stock price after the earnings report, the stock trades only modestly higher than it did after the last earnings report.Moreover, the negative book value may force a resale of some of that stuck at much lower prices if events force the company to shore up its balance sheet. While new buyers would enjoy the likely discount such a move would bring, it would also bring pain to AZO’s current investors.Although AutoZone missed estimates, investors should focus on the balance sheet and avoid AutoZone stock until management makes the balance sheet a priority. 7 'Buffett Stocks' to Buy From Berkshire's Former Money Guy Despite missing estimates, investors saw profit growth almost reach double-digit levels. With its low valuation, some might find this level of growth attractive. However, a low current ratio and a negative book value should give investors pause. Share buybacks continue to starve the company of much-needed capital that could reduce these liabilities and repair the balance sheet. Until book values reach positive territory, buying AZO stock remains an unwise choice.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. 3 Robotics ETFs to Buy for Big, High-Tech Profits  10 Retirement Stocks That You Should Already Own  5 Hot Stocks With Huge Revenue Drivers Ahead  Compare Brokers The post Slam the Brakes on AutoZone, Inc.

The Seattle-based tech giant plans to house at least 25,000 employees in each location, so job seekers intrigued by Amazon’s culture of fierce competition and breakneck growth will have plenty of opportunities to try their luck in applying.However, are Amazon jobs good and actually worth the hubbub over the new corporate sites? Working at any company has its pros and cons, and Amazon is no exception. Check out the reasons why you should — and shouldn’t — spring for that enticing job opening at the popular online retailer.If you manage to land a position with the online retailer, you’ll be in the company of first-rate talent. Nearly 1,000 employees at Amazon have written Glassdoor reviews about their exceptionally smart, creative co-workers as of February 2018, according to Business Insider. A finance manager in Seattle called Amazon’s employees “the best of the best” that could be hired anywhere.Working with highly competitive, world-class employees can have its disadvantages, especially when your co-workers might not have your best interests at heart. Amazon’s aggressive approach apparently isn’t limited to the market — it can be seen as part of the internal culture, too.“Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian,” said a Seattle-based software development manager on Glassdoor.The average salary at Amazon is $100,000 a year, according to PayScale, which means employees can get compensated handsomely at the company. A former warehouse associate in Pennsylvania posted on Glassdoor and complimented the “great starting pay and the ability to get raises very quickly,” and a former area manager in Georgia noted that Amazon employee perks “are the best thing about working at Amazon.”Worth It? You’ll Hate These Jobs But Love the MoneyDespite the positive comments about compensation, more than 400 reviews complained about the lack of work-life balance in the typical Amazon work schedule, according to Business Insider. In a telling report, Amazon didn’t even break the top 100 in Glassdoor’s 2018 Best Places to Work — which was chosen by employees — although other tech companies such as Facebook and Google ranked among the top 10. Amazon remains innovative by pushing a hungry startup mentality — or, as founder and CEO Jeff Bezos wrote in a 2017 letter to shareholders, consistently operating as if it were “Day 1.” A work culture that rebukes complacency can allow employees to hit milestones and develop their Amazon careers faster compared to traditional companies.In a controversial 2015 article, The New York Times reported on workers at Amazon who alleged that they had been evaluated unfairly by management due to a variety of personal reasons, such as taking time off for cancer treatment, dealing with a miscarriage or caring for elderly parents.Jay Carney, the senior vice president for global corporate affairs at Amazon, published a response on Medium criticizing the fact-checking and lack of context in the article, which he said “misrepresented Amazon.”In an effort to bridge the pay gap for women and people of color, Amazon banned its recruiters and hiring managers from asking interviewees about their salary history or using certain tools to gain that information, reported BuzzFeed News in January 2018.Women and people of color are forced to carry lower wages between jobs — perpetuating pay discrimination — if their compensation is continually based on previous salaries, according to the National Women’s Law Center.The tech giant details its global workforce demographics on its “diversity at Amazon” webpage. Though 40 percent of Amazon’s workforce is female, only 26 percent of managers are women. And, 63 percent of managers are white compared to 42 percent of overall workers.However, Amazon doesn’t rate poorly in terms of pay equity — in 2017, “women earned 101.5 cents for every dollar that men earned in the same jobs, and that minorities earned 100.5 cents for every dollar that white employees earned in the same jobs,” according to the company.Related: Here’s the Industry That Pays Women a Staggering 38% Less Than MenIn October 2018, Amazon announced a minimum wage increase that benefits over 250,000 employees — plus more than 100,000 seasonal workers for the holidays — effective Nov. 1. The new minimum wage is $15, compared to the current federal minimum wage of $7.25.“We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do and decided we want to lead,” said Bezos in the press release.Read: Amazon Adds New Wage Hike Worth About $400M, Backpedals on Bonus CutsAmazon has traditionally opposed unionization by its warehouse workers and other employees despite multiple attempts over the years, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, the situation could change with the company’s acquisition of Whole Foods. In September 2018, discontented employees at the grocery chain renewed efforts to unionize under Amazon due to perceived changes in compensation and corporate culture.Employees working Amazon jobs have unparalleled access to data from various tools and applications. Unlike many companies that isolate their research on artificial intelligence, Amazon integrates findings from machine learning throughout the company, according to Forbes. Information and insights are shared across departments; different teams can take advantage of AI technology to help innovate with their respective products.Looking for Work? The Most Popular Companies in the 50 Biggest US CitiesAccess to advanced technology can exact its price in other areas — particularly security and privacy. In early 2018, Amazon got two patents for a wristband tracking system approved, according to The New York Times. The idea was to streamline tasks by monitoring the location of employees’ hands relative to inventory bins and providing “haptic feedback,” but the wristbands could result in greater surveillance in the workplace if Amazon moves forward with manufacturing them.Click through to read more about why you shouldn’t work for money and what you should work for instead.More on JobsThese 11 Major Companies Allow You to Work From Home28 Weirdest Ways to Make MoneyHow Do You Stack Up to the Average Income in Your State?Watch: The Key to Negotiating a Higher Salary at Your New JobWe make money easy.

Some of the industry's titans — Glencore Plc, Vitol Group and Trafigura Group — have no women in senior executive roles.""Commodities trading desks can be very intimidating places if you are a woman,"" said Roxana Mohammadian-Molina, a former commodities strategist at an investment bank who spent 10 years in the sector and now works for peer-to-peer lending platform Blend Network. “The set of survival skills needed is similar to that of a lion tamer going into the lion's cage.”In the past year, the world's business and political leaders have faced a reckoning as the #MeToo movement and U.K. pay gap data point the spotlight on widespread gender discrimination.The disparity between men and women in leadership at commodities traders is wider than most American financial institutions and U.K. blue-chip companies. But like other businesses, the reasons are complex.The business culture hasn't evolved much in recent decades and there's little support for flexible working. Multimillion dollar deals are often made with a handshake after late-night dinner and drinks in hotel bars. One leading metals trader holds an annual party at London's Playboy Club.Related industries such as oil and mining have also struggled to attract women. Many of the biggest trading houses are also privately held, so they face less scrutiny from investors and media.""This is something that needs to change,"" said Marco Dunand, chief executive officer at Mercuria Energy Group in Geneva. ""The problem is how do you attract more women to trading? It enriches your company to have more females. I look at it from a value perspective.""Mercuria has a relatively high proportion of women. They account for four of the 12 positions among top leadership.Bloomberg News tracked the number of men and women on the executive committees at 40 of the biggest traders of energy, metals and agriculture. The statistics are based on data from annual reports, regulatory filings, corporate websites and interviews.Glencore said 40 percent of its trading business staff are women, and declined to provide further information. Vitol and Trafigura declined to comment.At Louis Dreyfus Co., the 23 executives that run day-to-day operations are all male. The agriculture trader is the only one among the majors that's controlled by a woman, billionaire chairwoman Margarita Louis-Dreyfus.The company said it's taking steps to increase diversity and inclusion. ""We recognize the positive benefits that this can have on business performance and culture,"" Louis Dreyfus said in a statement.Three companies — Mercuria, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and Cargill Inc. — account for more than half the women in senior positions.There are two women on the 21-person team of top leadership at ADM. The company said it has increased female hires in its U.S. trading unit by 30 percent in the last three years.Cargill has two women and seven men on its top executive committee. ""We have to support and elevate women — and all underrepresented U.S. minorities — at every level of the organization,"" said Demetha Sanders, who leads inclusion and diversity at the Minneapolis-based trading house.While no major trading house has a female CEO, women do lead some smaller merchants. Inga Srenger heads Petraco Oil Co., which trades about 350,000 barrels a day of crude and refined products. Ruth Sandelowsky, a veteran petrochemicals trader, runs Kolmar Group AG.The gender difference also shows up in paychecks. At the U.K. trading division of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the average bonus paid to women was 62 percent less than men. That compares with a 28 percent gap for the rest of Shell's British operations.Overall bonus pay for women working at BP Plc was 64 percent less than men. The company does not break out separate data for the trading unit.""We also have roles such as trading where pay is weighted heavily towards performance bonuses,"" BP said in a 2017 report. ""These roles are predominantly performed by men, contributing to the bonus gap.""Claire Tomlin, who worked as a fuel oil trader at Shell in the 1990s, said there are other reasons for the gender gap, such as badly planned provision for maternity cover and a lack of networking opportunities. Historically, fewer women have studied subjects like engineering that funnel people toward the oil industry.""We haven't reached a critical mass of women in the industry, we're not there yet,"" said Tomlin, who is now a managing director at commodities headhunting firm Clarion Search. ""Once we get there, working practices will change.""See original article on Fortune.comMore from Fortune.comAmerican Inventors Are Mostly White Men Due To Opportunity Gaps, Says Stanford 'Lost Einsteins' StudyWhy Men Still Dominate Corporate BoardroomsWhite Men an ""Endangered Species"" in UK Boardrooms According to Tesco ChairmanCommon Threads in Davos: AI, China, and Donald TrumpTencent Company Party Subjects Female Employees to Humiliating Oral Sex 'Game'Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

WMT suffered its worst day on Wall Street in more than 30 years, with shares plunging 10.2% on a single day after it reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter results, primarily because of slower e-commerce sales growth.Naturally, investors are concerned but the company is confident of bouncing back by doubling down on its investments in e-commerce and online grocery sales. Moreover, slower e-commerce sales growth was somewhat expected as this was also the first time that Jet.com sales in the year-ago period was included in e-commerce revenues. Hence, the picture isn’t as gloomy as it looks at first glance.Why Walmart Slipped UpThe most eye-catching development was Walmart’s e-commerce sales growth in the United States that slowed to 23% in the fourth quarter, marking a sharp decline from 50% in the prior quarter. This might have been viewed as a setback for investors but it’s too early to draw conclusions.Incidentally, what most people are overlooking is that last year’s results got a big boost because of its acquisition of Jet.com. Moreover, it was expected that growth would slow because Jet.com’s sales in the year-ago period was included in Walmart’s e-commerce revenues for the first time.That said, Walmart is hopeful of registering 40% growth in online sales this year, which should boost investors’ confidence. Moreover, the panic among investors is not a result of Walmart’s slower e-commerce sales growth but because of increasing competition from Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, which has in the last few years changed the entire retail ballgame by bridging the gap between traditional and online retail. How Amazon Has Changed the Retail GameThe biggest move in the brick-and-mortar space was made by Amazon when it acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. It slashed the prices of a number of products to enhance its online retail sales, which worked in its favor.The Whole Foods’ acquisition came within a year after Walmart decided to penetrate the e-commerce space with the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. The acquisition immediately gave Amazon access to Whole Foods’ 450 stores across the United States, thus providing it enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target TGT, Dollar Tree DLTR and Dollar General DG. Walmart has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Moreover, Amazon recently announced that it will offer free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods’ stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach.Amazon certainly has established its dominance in the online retail space but the other players aren’t lagging either. Walmart continues to be the country’s largest grocer and is trying to tap this space by offering customers the option of ordering online and a free pick-up from the store. Target brought online grocery-delivery company Shift to add muscle to it online delivery arm. Interestingly, Walmart’s shares have increased 28.32% in the last year, while that of Target has risen 13.38%. Dollar Tree and Dollar General’s shares have increased 34.25% and 19.85%, respectively, in the last 12 months.Walmart Fights BackBesides registering slower-than-expected e-commerce sales, Walmart also acknowledged a few mistakes it made during the fourth quarter that negatively impacted its sales. One of these was an increase in TVs, toys and electronics in its warehouses that eliminated space for basic items during peak holiday sales.However, it’s not the end of the road for Walmart as it seems on track to boost its online sales. The company has plans of investing extensively in e-commerce this year, which is expected to drive organic sales by 40% in fiscal 2019. Since acquiring Jet.com, Walmart has spruced up its online services and increased the number of available items.Moreover, it has acquired brands such as Bonobos and ModCloth and intends to revamp its website with a focus on fashion. Also, Walmart recently launched a home shopping vertical on its website with a focus on furniture, accessories and other decorative items. The company is also making huge investments in training its employees.Beyond Brick and MortarOne of biggest strategic moves made by the company lately was to do away with “Stores” from its corporate name in order to give an impression to customers that it doesn’t want to restrict itself to a traditional brick and mortar company. Walmarts’ stores, however, give it an edge over Amazon, its biggest competitor. Keeping that in mind, the company is planning to double the locations offering grocery delivery, which is likely to boost sales.The biggest advantage for Walmart is that it is a lot larger than Amazon in terms of revenues. The company’s 2017 sales crossed $500 billion, making it three times bigger than Amazon. Moreover, while Walmart’s stock nosedived last week, it traded at an all-time high with a 12-month gain of more than 60% in late January just before the market entered correction territory.Not the End of the RoadThe sharp decline in the company’s shares might have made investors skeptical but Walmart has a lot of things going in its favor, with the Republican tax cut likely to help retailers save an astounding $175 billion, per the National Retail Federation (NRA). Moreover, the company is confident of registering 40% growth in online sales in fiscal 2019 with huge investments in e-commerce to include a re-launch of its website along with other initiatives.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

For a lot of people, he said, “It’s easy to typecast us as a monolith. … And I think it’s much harder to grapple with the nuance … that my reality and my life experience [are] vastly different” from that of every other Gen Z-er.One of the biggest ways Gen Z is different than older generations, Ahmed noted, is its inclusive mindset. “We think in terms of ‘we.’ … When I go to the polls November 6 … I’m not just thinking about the people who live on my street. I’m thinking about the people who I’m connected to on social media from all around the world and thinking about how my vote and my life affect them,” he said. “And I think that that ethos … is a core tenant of our generation.”The young CEO stressed that companies should appeal to his generation’s sense of social justice and responsibility. By doing so, he said, they can gain access to a whole new level of organic marketing.“Gen Z controls the hashtag, and we made [the Kaepernick–Nike ad] go viral because we want the provocative,” Ahmed said. “We’re following the issues. We’re not too young to be political. Our personhood and our politicalness are not separable.”Ahmed says companies should take note of Gen Z’s distrust of “big institutions … of a lot of these power structures that have really oppressed a lot of people for a long time.” “We believe in moments of beauty. We believe in stories,” Ahmed said. “It’s about tapping into the humanity of our generation.”READ MORE: Boxing Legend De La Hoya on Nike–Kaepernick: ‘I live in America for a reason’Follow Katie on Twitter.

With a market valuation of US$12b, GRMN is a safe haven in times of market uncertainty due to its strong balance sheet. These firms won’t be left high and dry if liquidity dries up, and they will be relatively unaffected by rises in interest rates. Today I will analyse the latest financial data for GRMN to determine is solvency and liquidity and whether the stock is a sound investment.  View our latest analysis for Garmin  What is considered a high debt-to-equity ratio differs depending on the industry, because some industries tend to utilize more debt financing than others. Generally, large-cap stocks are considered financially healthy if its ratio is below 40%. The good news for investors is that Garmin has no debt. It has been operating its business with zero debt and utilising only its equity capital. Investors’ risk associated with debt is virtually non-existent with GRMN, and the company has plenty of headroom and ability to raise debt should it need to in the future.Since Garmin doesn’t have any debt on its balance sheet, it doesn’t have any solvency issues, which is a term used to describe the company’s ability to meet its long-term obligations. But another important aspect of financial health is liquidity: the company’s ability to meet short-term obligations, including payments to suppliers and employees. With current liabilities at US$854m, it seems that the business has been able to meet these obligations given the level of current assets of US$2.4b, with a current ratio of 2.81x. Generally, for Consumer Durables companies, this is a reasonable ratio since there is a bit of a cash buffer without leaving too much capital in a low-return environment.GRMN has zero debt as well as ample cash to cover its short-term commitments. Its strong balance sheet reduces risk for the company and shareholders. Keep in mind I haven’t considered other factors such as how GRMN has performed in the past.

The contract has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will provide Hydra rockets to Afghanistan, Nigeria, Australia, Lebanon and the Philippines, under the foreign military sales program.Work related to the contract will be performed in Williston, VT and is expected to get completed by Mar 31, 2021. General Dynamics will utilize fiscal 2010, 2016, 2017 and 2018 other procurement; Army; foreign military sales; and Department of Defense funds for completing the delivery.Advantages of the Hydra-70 RocketsGeneral Dynamics' Hydra-70 rockets include unitary and cargo warheads for use against point and area targets, providing the user with a lethal and lightweight weapon system with multi-mission capability. The Hydra-70 rockets are universally compatible with the Advanced Precision Kill System (APKWS). These warheads provide low-cost munitions, which are capable of area suppression and defeating threats at extended ranges, when fittedto the MK66 MOD 4 motor.These rockets provide military personnel with affordable firepower that enable them to effectively engage and suppress area of lower-value targets on a battlefield. These advanced rockets can also be mounted on most of the rotary and fixed-wing aircraft, which include the Apache, Cobra and F-16.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?As widespread geo-political tensions loom across the globe, many nations are strengthening their arsenals and taking significant initiatives to upgrade rocket systems. Evidently, the rocket and missile market is projected to see a CAGR of 4.74% to $70 billion (as per Markets and Markets research firm) during 2017-2022. This reflects solid growth prospects for rocket makers like General Dynamics to further expand their footprint in the rocket and missile market.Notably, General Dynamics' Combat Systems segment that manufactures and supplies Hydra-70 rockets registered $1.53 billion of sales in the second quarter of 2018, reflecting 8.5% year-over-year growth. We may expect General Dynamics to witness similar strong results in this segment in the upcoming quarters as well, buoyed by strong demand for its combat-proven rocket systems that eventually lead to contract wins like the latest one. This, in turn, should expand the company’s profit margin.Interestingly, the fiscal 2019 defense budget that got approved by the U.S. Senate toward the end of June 2018 provisioned for a spending plan of $1.2 billion on the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. Such favorable budgetary inclusions should aid General Dynamics in acquiring major contracts related to its various rocket systems, going ahead.Price MovementGeneral Dynamics’s stock has lost 0.9% in the last year compared with its industry’s growth of 22.1%. The underperformance may have been caused by intense competition in the aerospace-defense space.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings AJRD, Engility Holdings EGL and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.While Aerojet Rocketdyne sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Huntington Ingalls and Engility carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Courtesy photo: John F. Martin for General Motors. [/caption] After years in-house at General Motors Co., Lucy Clark Dougherty is making the to move to off-road vehicle maker Polaris Industries Inc., according to an announcement from the company this week. Effective Jan. 29, Clark Dougherty will serve as senior vice president, general counsel, compliance officer and corporate secretary. She replaces Stacy Bogart, who left Minnesota-based Polaris to be general counsel at Winnebago Industries Inc. Clark Dougherty could not be reached for comment on her move, but in Tuesday’s announcement, she said she looks “forward to building on the strong legal and governance foundation already in place, helping to drive growth and long-term value with integrity.” Her resume includes eight years with GM, most recently serving as deputy general counsel for global markets, autonomous vehicles and transportation as a service. Her tenure at the automaker also included a stint as vice president and general counsel for GM North America. While in this role, GM’s ignition switch scandal thrust Clark Dougherty and former top GM attorney Michael Millikin into the spotlight, as the legal department’s handling of the issue came under tough public scrutiny. While at least four GM lawyers were fired because of the ignition switch defect, Clark Dougherty was selected to serve as legal advisor to global vehicle safety chief Jeff Boyer. Prior to GM, Clark Dougherty worked in the public sector with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, where she was eventually named chief legal officer and counselor to the secretary of Homeland Security. “Lucy has proven her ability to deliver results in various complex, challenging, and dynamic environments,” Polaris CEO Scott Wine said in the announcement. “She is a pragmatic leader whose strategic legal counsel has elevated the performance of a wide variety of operations and functions. Between her time at GM and her roles within the public sector, Lucy brings extensive legal expertise and a breadth of experience that will serve as tremendous assets to Polaris.”Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

But General Electric (NYSE: GE) has taken shedding weight to the extreme over the last 10 years. The conglomerate has already changed its portfolio of businesses considerably, and things will change even further in the near future.Here's how GE has changed in the past decade, and what investors can expect from the industrial giant moving forward.The stock market hasn't been kind to General Electric lately. Can a restructuring return it to outperformance? Image source: Getty Images.At the beginning of 2008, just before the financial crisis hit, General Electric was riding high. During the tenure of CEO ""Neutron"" Jack Welch, who headed the company from 1981-2001, GE's value had skyrocketed. Immediately following his departure, though, the bursting of the tech bubble caused the company's stock -- along with the broader stock market -- to plummet.However, GE's stock had risen more than 50% since its 2003 lows, and the company's portfolio was incredibly diverse, including a stake in media giant NBC Universal as well as financial and real-estate holdings:Data source: GE 2007 Annual Report. Chart by author.As you can see from the chart, financial and media revenue (the green and bright yellow wedges) made up nearly half of GE's overall revenue in 2007. This was a mixed blessing and a curse for the company. General Electric's media holdings had some of the highest profit margins -- above 20% -- but they really didn't fit in with the rest of the company, meaning there were very few operational synergies. Likewise, while financial services easily made up the largest chunk of GE's revenue, that proved not to be so fortunate when the financial crisis hit and millions of people began defaulting on their mortgages and credit card balances.The financial crisis was the catalyst that caused then-CEO Jeff Immelt to begin to drastically reconfigure GE's portfolio.Fast-forward to 2017. Immelt has decided to refocus the company's portfolio on its industrial roots. Gone is the stake in NBC Universal. Most of the company's financial businesses -- including real estate and consumer credit cards -- have been spun off or sold, leaving GE Capital focused primarily on offering credit to the company's industrial customers. GE's iconic-but-low-margin appliances division was sold to Chinese manufacturer Haier.Here's where things stood:Data source: GE 2017 Annual Report. Chart by author.As you can see, some of the company's remaining industrial divisions started small and remained small. For example, the transportation division accounts for just 3% of company revenue in 2007 and in 2017. Most of the other industrial divisions' revenue percentages naturally grew as media and financial revenue was removed from the picture. Energy -- which includes GE's gas and wind turbine businesses -- grew with the acquisition of French company Alstom's power unit.But oil and gas (the gray wedge in both charts) saw the biggest increase, comprising 14% of revenue in 2017, up from just 4% in 2007, thanks to Immelt's poorly timed acquisitions of oil and gas services companies just before the oil price collapse of 2014. This led to the merging of GE's oil and gas division with oilfield services provider Baker Hughes to form Baker Hughes, a GE Company (NYSE: BHGE), in which GE holds a 62.5% stake.Investors, though, were much worse off than they were in 2007, because more than half of the company's revenue (in energy, oil and gas, and consumer lighting) was generating profit margins of less than 12%, and thanks to an unforeseen insurance charge, the financial division actually lost money for the year.New CEO John Flannery was left with several unappealing options to try to get the company back on track, and the changes he's made -- while necessary -- have been pretty drastic.Flannery engineered the sale of GE Transportation to Wabtec, announced plans to unwind the company's stake in Baker Hughes (effectively exiting the oil and gas services sector), and has also put the company's healthcare and consumer lighting businesses up for sale. Key parts of the company's digital assets are also up for sale. Once all this shakes out, here's what the company might look like:Data based on revenue percentages from 2017 Annual Report, stripping out revenue from businesses that have been sold or are up for sale. Chart by author.I've used 2017's revenue numbers for each division to create this chart, so it's possible there could be some fluctuation (for example, if sales in the power division continue to decline), but this is roughly what investors can expect GE to look like in 2020.It's not exactly a pretty picture. Energy sales -- including sales from the power division, which primarily manufactures gas turbines, and the renewable energy division, which primarily manufactures wind turbines -- would make up more than half of the company's revenue. Unfortunately, margins in those businesses aren't holding up thanks to weak gas turbine markets and competitive pressure in wind turbine markets. The company's digital efforts and its Predix platform have been all but abandoned and won't meaningfully contribute to future growth. And with GE Capital hamstrung thanks to its insurance obligations, that leaves the aviation division to do all of the heavy lifting for the company.Aviation is easily the company's strongest division, reporting a 24.1% profit margin in 2017, which is excellent for an industrial manufacturer. But if it only makes up about one-third of company revenue, will that strength be enough to propel GE to growth?It's possible that slimming down the company's portfolio will pay off for Flannery and for GE. Selling some (OK, most) of the company's divisions will offer management the opportunity to streamline the corporate structure and reduce costs. The company's outperforming healthcare division is likely to be attractive to buyers, which should help Flannery shore up GE's balance sheet, as will the sale of its stake in Baker Hughes.But once the dust settles, GE is going to be left with a winning aviation engine business and an energy turbine business in desperate need of a turnaround, with no clear path to overall growth. Maybe GE will continue to radically reshape its portfolio over the next 10 years through acquisitions -- or maybe it will stick with the current simplified structure. Either way, though, outperformance is uncertain, and there are probably better places for your money.

This time, this industrial conglomerate has agreed to divest a unit of GE Aviation — MRA Systems LLC — to Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd. (“ST Engineering”).ST Engineering, a well recognized integrated engineering company, primarily serves customers in electronics, land systems, aerospace and marine sectors. Its operations are spread across various nations, including Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Middle East. The aforementioned transaction will be accomplished through its U.S. subsidiary — Vision Technologies Aerospace Incorporated.On the other hand, Maryland-based MRA Systems is one of the leading manufacturers of nacelles and braking systems for jet engines. It was acquired in the 1990s from Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT. Its employee strength is approximately 800.For General Electric, this deal — structured as a conditional share purchase agreement — will likely fetch $630 million (on cash and debt-free basis).Completion of the divestment, likely in the first quarter of 2019, is currently subject to the fulfillment of closing conditions. General Electric’s Restructuring InitiativesSimilar moves, directed to secure shareholders’ interests, was taken by General Electric in the past few quarters.It’s worth noting, in order to become a high-tech industrial company, General Electric decided to restructure its business portfolio in June 2018. For this, it plans to separate GE Healthcare and turn it into a stand-alone company. Further, the company will exit oil and gas businesses by disposing its 62.5% interest stake in Baker Hughes, a GE company BHGE. Beside these, GE Transportation is going to be sold to Wabtec Corporation and efforts are on track to reduce exposure in GE Capital business.In addition to the proposed restructuring initiatives, the company will divest its Distributed Power business to Advent International, GE Healthcare’s Value-Based Care business to Veritas Capital,Baker Hughes’ Natural Gas Solutions business toFirst Reserve Corporation and Pietro Fiorentini S.p.A., and GE Capital’s Project Finance Debt Business to Starwood Property Trust, Inc. STWD. Moreover, the company will acquire the Netherlands-based WMC test facilities for its Renewable Energy business. Zacks Rank, Price Performance and Earnings EstimatesGeneral Electric currently has a market capitalization of $110.5 billion. It presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company noted that these latest developments will offer a more decentralized, decarbonized and digitalized energy landscape for end users. Grid Solutions business is a division of General Electric’s largest business segment — GE Power.Inside the HeadlinesThe global energy landscape is going through immense transformation. In sync with this, GE Power’s Grid Solutions team is currently making investments to develop state-of-the-art automation, high-voltage, direct current (HVDC), and digital technologies, in a bid to transform the quality of energy networks globally.In the past, a simpler grid model transmitted electricity from large generation plants to end users. However, going forward, a power grid is expected to be faster, smarter and include more interoperable solutions for ensuring greater efficiency, resiliency and security.GE Power’s Grid Solutions team stated that its newly-displayed product innovations will not only alert the existing energy related technologies, but also make the electric grids more efficient.In this year’s CIGRE, the company rolled out a couple of innovative products and services to back up its existing grid modernization motto. For instance, the company introduced eLumina HVDC Control System — the first HVDC solution in the industry that supports digital-measurement system based on IEC 61850. A new F35 Gas-Insulated Substation has also been unveiled for ensuring more reliable power delivery in wind farm, industrial and urban applications. In addition to these, the company showed its fresh Asset Lifecycle Management Servicesand Intelligent Digital Substations in the exhibition.General Electric is poised to grow on the back of its strategic restructuring moves, strong international presence and robust end-market sales. However, over the past month, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 2.9%, as against 0.9% gain recorded by the industry. Generating revenues of roughly $7.6 billion in second-quarter 2018, GE Power is the largest business segment of General Electric in terms of corporate revenues. The company believes weakness in new gas orders, increasing popularity of renewable energy sources, overcapacity, macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical tensions might take a toll on the segment's performances in the quarters ahead, while its cost-reduction actions are anticipated to bring in some relief. Notably, GE Power anticipates meeting the $1-billion target of structural costs reduction in 2018.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Federal Signal Corporation FSS sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy). The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 22.48% over the past four quarters. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Carlisle Companies Incorporated CSL holds a Zacks Rank #2. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 12.85% over the trailing four quarters.Crane Company CR also carries a Zacks Rank of 2. The company generated an average positive earnings surprise of 3.03% during the same time frame.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

The quintessential conglomerate, with a presence in almost every part of the global economy, it seemed to have been built to withstand economic shocks and was the choice for conservative investors, scared of the short life cycles and the volatile fortunes of its tech challengers.Unlike other aging companies like Sears Holdings Corp (OTCMKTS:SHLDQ) that have decayed gradually over decades, GE's fall from grace has been precipitous , with the rate of decline accelerating the in the last two years.

The company established its first industrial lab in 1900 and it would not be an exaggeration to say that it revolutionized not just the American home, with its appliances, but changed the way Americans live. For much of of the twentieth century, though, GE remained an appliance company, though it made forays into other businesses. It was in 1980, when Jack Welch became the CEO of the company, that the company started its march towards what it has become today.The Market HistoryThe first place to start, when looking at GE, is to see how markets have viewed it, over its life. Skipping over the first half of GE's life, the graph below looks at the growth (and recent decline) of GE's market capitalization over time:As you can see, GE was a solid but unspectacular investment from 1950 to 1980, and exploded in value in the 1980s and 1990s, with Jack Welch at its helm, and reached its most valuable company in the world status in 2001. Under Jeff Immelt, his successor, the stock continued to do well, but it dropped with the rest of the market as the dot com bubble burst, but then recovered leaving into the 2008 crisis. That crisis was devastating for the company and while it did recover somewhat in the years after, the bottom has clearly dropped out in the last two years, with Jeff Flannery at the top of the company.The Operating HistoryTo get operating perspective on how the company has evolved over time, we looked at how GE""s key operating metrics (revenues, EBITDA, net income) have evolved since 1950:In keeping with our earlier market cap assessment, between 1950 and 1970, GE was a good but not exceptional company, delivering solid revenue growth and decent margins. Under two CEOS, Reginald Jones in the 1970s and Jack Welch in the two decades thereafter, the company transformed itself. Jones helped the company navigate through the turbulent period of high inflation and oil prices, holding margins steady and delivering double digit revenue growth. Welch made himself the stuff of legend, by doubling margins and pushing the company to the top of the market cap ranks by the time he left the firm. His successor Jeff Immelt faced the unenviable task of following Welch, but managed to keep revenues growing and delivered high margins until 2008, when the bottom fell out for the company.[company-follow-email id=40545][/company-follow-email]The Business Mix ShiftTo understand GE's current plight, we have to go back to Welch's tenure as CEO, when he remade the firm, by moving it away from its domestic and manufacturing roots and giving it a global and multi-business focus. GE's biggest leap during that period was into the financial services business, and one reason Welch was attracted to the financial services business was its capacity to generate high profits with relatively little investment. By the late 1990s, GE Capital was the engine driving GE's growth, accounting for almost 48% of revenues in 1998 and as you can see in the graph below, it continued to do so for much of the first decade of Immelt's stewardship:In 2008, when the crisis hit financial service firms had, GE was significantly exposed, and in the years since, GE has retreated not just from the financial services business but also from its entertainment bets (with the sale of NBC to Comcast) and from the appliance business (now owned by Haier). GE's current business mix, broken down into more detail, is shown in the pie chart below:GE Annual Report for 2017 (Invested Capital, allocated based upon assets by business)Today, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is in three businesses (aviation, healthcare and transportation) that have low growth and high profitability (margins and returns on capital), in three energy-related businesses (power, renewable energy and oil) with higher growth but low profitability (margins & returns on capital), one business (lighting) that is fading quickly and one (capital) that is declining, but dragging value down with it. Note also that the collective profits reported across businesses is before corporate expenses and eliminations of $3.83 billion (not counting a one-time restructuring charge of $4.1 billion) that effectively wipe out about half of the operating profits.When computing return on capital, I allocated these expenses to the businesses, based upon revenues, and used a 25% effective tax rate, and while GE as a whole did not deliver a return that meets its cost of capital requirements in 2017, aviation, healthcare and transportation clear their hurdle rates by plenty. Replacing 2017 income in each business with a normalized value (computed using the average margins in each business between 2013 and 2017) improves the return on capital at the power and renewable energy businesses, but the overall conclusion remains the same. GE, as a company, does not look good, but it does have significant value creating businesses.Corporate Life Cycle While there are different ways of framing GE's current standing, I will use the corporate life cycle, since it encapsulates the challenges facing the company.GE's light bulb moment might have been in Thomas Edison's lab in 1878, but at an official corporate age of 126 years, GE is an ancient company and its problems reflect its age. Other than renewable energy, all of GE's businesses are mature or declining, and by the laws of mathematics, GE itself is a mature to declining company. Any story that you tell about GE going forward has to reflect this reality, and there are three possible ones that can lead to different values.1. Break it up: If GE at its peak represented the glory of conglomerates, its current plight is a sign of how far conglomerates have fallen in the world. Across the world, multi business companies are finding themselves under pressure to break up and in many cases, their stockholders will be better off if they do. To gain from a break up, though, here are some of the things that have to be true.- Separable businesses: The different businesses have to be separable, since leakages and synergies across businesses can make it more difficult to cleave off pieces to sell or spin off. On this count, GE is probably on safe ground, since its businesses (other than GE Capital) are self standing, for the most part, with little in terms of cross business effects.- Willing buyers: There have to be potential buyers who are willing to pay prices for the pieces that exceed what they will generate as value for the holding company, as going concerns, and those higher prices either have to come from potential synergies or changed management. None of GE's businesses seem alluring enough to attract multiple bidders, willing to pay premium prices, and given GE's shaky bargaining position, it is more likely than not that a rush to unload businesses will do more harm than good.- Corporate Waste (at HQ): A large chunk of the corporate overhead has to viewed as wasteful, with a big drop in corporate expenses accompanying the breakup. How much of the corporate expense of $3.8 billion that GE reported in 2017 is wasteful and could be eliminated with targeted cost cuts? Looking at the breakdown of these expenses, just about $2.2 billion in for covering pension obligations and breaking up the company will not relieve the company of its contractual obligations. Some of the remaining $1.6 billion may be fat that can be cut, but even cutting the entire amount (which would be a tall order) will not turn the company around.Since GE will be trying to sell these businesses to buyers today, this is a pricing and not a valuation exercise, and I have estimate a pricing for GE's businesses below, using an EBITDA recomputed using the average operating margin in each business over the last five years to compute operating income and allocating corporate expenses to the divisions, based upon revenues. To convert the EBITDA to an estimated value, I used the EV/EBITDA multiples of the peer group:Download spreadsheetIf GE is able to get buyers to pay industry-level multiples of EBITDA for each of these businesses, it will be able to net about $103 billion for its equity investors, higher than the market capitalization on November 14 of $72 billion. The problem, though, is that fire sales of entire companies almost never deliver the expected proceeds, as buyers, recognizing desperation, hold back. In fact, GE's attempts to extricate itself from a portion of its Baker-Hughes investment in the last few days show that these sales will occur at a discount.2. Retrench and Reshape: The second choice for GE is to retrench and perhaps renew itself, not as a growth company, but as a stable, high margin company in businesses where it has a competitive advantage. In broad terms, the roadmap for GE to succeed in this path is a simple one, shrinking or selling off pieces of its low-margin businesses, exiting the capital business and consolidating its presence in the aviation, healthcare and transportation businesses. To get a better sense of what the businesses would be worth, as continuing operations, I valued each of GE's business, using simplistic assumptions: I used the sector cost of capital for each business, set growth in the next five years equal to revenue growth in each of GE's businesses in the last five years and normalized operating income based upon the average operating margin that each of GE's businesses have delivered over the last five years:Download spreadsheetThe value that I derive for equity is lower than the $103 billion that I estimated in the last section, but it does not require any near term fire sales at discounts. There are two big challenges that GE will face along the way. The first is that GE is saddled with a significant debt obligation, a legacy of GE Capital, that will not fade away quickly, and the debt obligations represent a clear and present danger to the firm. One reason for the rapid drop in GE's stock price in the last few weeks has been the deterioration in the company's credit standing, as can be seen in the rising default spreads for the company in the CDS market.The reason that GE is trying to sell some of its stake in Baker and Hughes to pay down debt, but bond markets are skeptical, with good reason. The second is that GE Capital is now more burden than benefit to investors. In the valuation table, note that the value that I have estimated for GE Capital's operations ($27 billion) is much lower than GE Capital debt ($51 billion); in fact, I derive very similar results in the pricing. Put differently, in my valuation, I foresee the cost of exiting GE capital to be $24 billion in today's terms, but spread out over time. If GE can navigate its way through its debt payments to becoming a more focused company, with constrained ambitions, it could survive and reclaim its place as a holding for a conservative value investor.3. Reincarnate (or the Bataan Death March): There is a third option that GE shareholders have to hope and pray that GE does not take, where the company tries to recapture its old glory, throwing caution to the winds and reinvesting large amounts in new businesses, or worse still, large acquisitions. While there is no indication that Larry Culp, GE's new CEO, has grandiose plans for the company, that may be because the company is in crisis today. If as the crisis passes, Culp is tempted to make himself the second coming of Jack Welch, the company will follow the path of other aging companies that refuse to act their age, spending billions on cosmetic surgery (acquisitions) before finally capitulating. If there is a role model that Mr. Culp should follow, it is less that of Steve the Visionary, and more that of Larry the Liquidator.General LessonsGiven its age, it should come as no surprise that General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has been the subject of more case studies than perhaps any other company in the world. In its earlier days, it was used as an example of professional management, and during Jack Welch's years, it was held up as an illustration of how aging manufacturing companies can remake themselves, with enlightened management at the top. Now that it is in trouble, I think that we look back at the last four decades and draw a different set of lessons:1. Conglomeration was, is and always will be a bad idea: I never understood the allure of conglomerates, even in their heyday. Only a corporate strategist could argue that combining companies in different businesses under one corporate umbrella, paying hefty premiums along the way to acquire these holdings, creates value, ignoring the logic that you and I as stockholders can create our own diversified and customized portfolios, without paying the same premium. If there is a lesson to learn from GE's fall from grace, it is that even the best conglomerates are built on foundations of sand. Note, though, that while this lesson may be learned for the moment, it will be forgotten soon, as are most other business lessons are, and we will surely repeat the cycle again in the future.2. Complexity has a cost: As I was going through GE's annual report, I was reminded again of why I have always described my vision of hell as having to value GE over and over and over again, for eternity. This company, through its actions and by design, made itself into one of the most complex companies in history, operating in dozens of businesses and across the world, with GE Capital acting as the cherry on the complexity cake, a gigantic financial service firm embedded in a large conglomerate. While that complexity served GE well in its glory days, allowing it to hide mistakes from sloppy acquisition practices and bets gone bad, it has bedeviled the company since 2008. Investors trying to navigate their way through the company's financials often give up and move on to easier prey. It may be too late for GE to do much about this problem, but as Asian companies rise in market capitalization, you are seeing new complex behemoths coming into play across the world.3. Easy money has a catch: I know that 20/20 hindsight is both easy and unfair, but GE's experiences with GE Capital bring home an age-old business truth that when a business looks like it can make you easy money, there is always a catch. Jack Welch initial foray into and subsequent expansion of GE Capital was built on the allure that it was a lot easier to make money in financial services than in manufacturing. From the perspective of having limited capital investment and growing quickly, that was true, but financial service firms through history have always had periods of plenty interspersed with bouts of gut-wrenching and intense pain, when borrowers start defaulting and capital markets freeze up. By making GE Capital such a big part of GE, Welch bet the farm on its continued success, and that bet went sour in 2008.4. The Savior CEO is a myth: I come to neither bury nor praise Jack Welch, but notwithstanding the fact that he has been gone almost two decades from the firm, GE remains the house that Jack built. Since Welch got the glory that came from GE's rise in the last twenty years of the last century, he deserves a portion of the blame for what has happened since. Don't get me wrong! Jack Welch was an inspirational top manager, a man with vision and drive, but he was also an imperial CEO, who made his board of directors a rubber stamp for his actions. As we look at a new generation of successful companies, this time in the technology space (the FANG stocks and the Chinese giants), with visionary founders at the top, it is worth remembering that power left unchecked in any person (no matter how smart and visionary) is dangerous.The Bottom LineAs many of you know, I believe that every valuation has to have a story. With some companies, like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)), the story is uplifting and optimistic, and the valuations follow, but they still might not be good investments, since their prices may be even higher. My story for General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is not an upbeat one, but if it (and its management) acts its age, accepts that slower or no growth is what lies in the future and does not over reach, it is a good investment. I believe that the market has over corrected for GE's many faults, and at the current stock price, that it is significantly under valued. I will buy GE, but I will do so with open eyes, not expecting (or wanting) dividends to be paid until the debt gets paid down and the company exits the capital business with as much grace (and as few costs) as it can muster.YouTube VideoAttachmentsGE Pricing and Valuation in November 2018Disclosure: None.[daily-newsletter][/daily-newsletter]Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

But as a contrarian investment using a modified options strategy, GE stock is ready to bring good things to life for bulls. Let me explain.It has been a couple months since taking a look at GE stock as a contrarian-oriented investment. At the time, unsubstantiated rumors of interest from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway allowed for a modest boost in share price for a very out-of-favor investment controlled by bears and disgusted bulls tossing in the towel. It turns out the hopeful bid was all for naught.Another blow for investors came in late May as management warned it expects no profit growth from GE’s distressed power business. The surprise warning sent General Electric shares tumbling more than 7%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd just when it seems like the worst is over for General Electric, on Monday JP Morgan stated it believes GE stock’s dividend needs to be cut again in order to pay off enough debt to match ratings agencies expectations. Throw in other unresolved threats like GE’s legal woes and the S&P 500’s largest pension shortfall — and it begs the question, can GE stock can ever bring good things to life for investors?The monthly chart of GE stock shows a name that’s been under siege since early 2017. During that time a steep bearish decline has taken shares in-between the 62% and 76% retracement levels dating back to the low of the financial crisis nearly ten years ago. 10 Best Airline Stocks to Buy Right Now The obvious disdain for GE stock works in favor of contrarian-oriented investors, though expecting an overnight turnaround, if any, isn’t realistic. Having said that, a couple monthly chart doji decision candles and a deeply oversold stochastics condition is promising.Bottom line though, with no guarantees on the price chart and the latest victim being Monday’s dismantling of an emerging two-month long uptrend, a bullish modified spread combination is worth investors’ consideration.Reviewing GE stock’s options board and with shares at $13.71, I’m favoring the sale of the Jan $12/$11 put spread and purchase of the Jan $16/$19/$22 call butterfly for a combined debit of 5 cents.This moderately bullish position offers a nice margin of safety with only 5 cents at risk above the sold $12 put strike. That’s nearly 12.5% below the current GE stock price and a full 6% below the March low.If General Electric shares collapse below $11, this spread trader contains his or her exposure to $1.05 no matter what happens. That’s a nice insurance policy to hold and could allow for the purchase of stock at an even deeper discount below the put spread. Roku Inc Stock Makes for an Interesting Speculative Play On the upside, a moderately bullish long butterfly position offers a wide profit zone in-between $16.05 to $21.95. The max payout is $2.95 if GE stock lands on $19 at expiration.That’s a long shot, of course, as both time and price need to cooperate perfectly. However, at this point the strategy probably has a better chance of paying investors something meaningful versus questionable income from an at-risk dividend.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler’s management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

As GE Power’s business partner in the region, HE will provide the steam turbines, generators and other auxiliary systems for the project. Upon completion, Langfang will generate approximately 800 megawatts (MW) of power using the latest cogeneration (CHP) technology.""With the upgrade and transformation of the local economy and the coordinated development for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Langfang’s requirement for cleaner and more efficient energy has been increasing,” said Li Mingyu, general manager of Langfang. “With class leading efficiency, lower operating cost, best steam to power ratio for CHP application, high local content, execution & servicing, GE’s 9F.05 gas turbine is able to meet our requirement and sharpen our competitiveness in the power generation segment. We look forward to working closely with HE and GE Power in the future.”Located in the Anci Economic Development Zone of Langfang City in Hebei Province, Langfang will provide a steady stream of cleaner and more modernized energy. It will help the Bejing-Tianjin-Hebei region to strike the appropriate balance between local economic development and environmental protection. Langfang is expected to be commissioned in 2019 and will be connect to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan grid shortly afterwards. When complete, Langfang is expected to reach 60 percent efficiency in combined-cycle operation, with reliability of 99.8 percent and availability of 95.1 percent.“We’re proud to work with HE to support China’s forward-thinking energy goals,” said Joe Mastrangelo, president & CEO of GE’s Gas Power Systems. “By applying our global knowledge of CHP applications and delivering our most advanced F-class gas turbines together with HE’s innovative technology, we will deliver more reliable, efficient and environmentally-friendly power generation in China than ever before.”“We are ready to provide the high quality equipment and serive to Langfang, and together with the owner, we will build this project as the example project of 9F,” said Wu Weizhang, President of Harbin Electric Co., Ltd.With more than 400 units installed globally and more than 18 million combined operating hours, the 9F is one of GE’s most popular gas turbines worldwide. The 9F.05 is especially effective when combined with HE’s steam turbine, 330H gas turbine generator and steam turbine generator being used in Langfang. This combination of technologies can ultimately bring lower costs and higher profitability to SPIC thanks to a more efficient plant design.GE Power has invested in evolutionary improvements for the 9F.05 to make it a perfect fit for China. With the growth of renewable energy, China’s northern region requires excellent flexibility and part-load efficiency in power plants to maintain grid stability. The 9F.05’s enhanced flexibility and advanced compressor design meet the region’s needs for flexibility and efficiency, and Langfang’s development as a CHP power plant can maximize seasonal changes profitably, providing both power and heating needs for the region. For perspective, a single CHP plant of Langfang’s size could see savings reach RMB 6 million annually (based on 3,000 operating hours) while still meeting China’s advancing emissions requirements.For over 30 years, GE Power has provided to the Chinese energy industry with more than 200 gas turbines, 180 steam turbines, 300 gas engines, and over 40 licenses for gasification tech services. GE Power offers a complete portfolio of power solutions in China for Chinese customers, understanding their needs and providing the most flexible solutions to maximize customer value. GE Power is committed to supporting China’s clean energy initiative and helping China reshape a more balanced energy mix for sustainable development.Shares of General Electric are currently trading at $18.60, up $0.07 or 0.37%.

GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with AMZN. Click here to check it out. AMZN 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of AMZNPeter Lynch Chart of AMZNAs General Electric has spluttered to a halt, other companies have overtaken this dying beast in leaps and bounds: Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) are the new industrial giants of the 21st century.But there's been more to General Electric's downfall than just technological change. This company is possibly one of the best examples of how complex businesses can become their own worst enemy and how overexpansion can be destructive for shareholders.In August 2000, General Electric's market cap was $594 billion. Nearly two decades later, the company has lost nearly 90% of its value since this point. At the time of writing, the company's market capitalization is just $73 billion.And it looks as if there is going to be more paying out for shareholders before the company manages to stage a recovery. Earlier this week, the new CEO Larry Culp told reporters on CNBC that the company is looking to sell assets with ""urgency"" to reduce its high debt.""We have no higher priority right now than bringing leverage levels down,"" Culp told CNBC. ""We have plenty of opportunity to do that through asset sales.""This is a staggering admission to make on national TV, as it hints that the company is considering a fire sale for its assets. Even if it is not, the very fact that management has told the world that the company is looking to sell assets quickly to reduce debt means it is likely to receive lower prices as buyers know General Electric is in a tight spot.Problems clear Looking at the conglomerate, two factors stand out as being behind its problems over the past two decades.First of all, there is complexity. General Electric has so many different business arms and divisions that it is difficult to understand what goes where and what contributes to what. The company has made several significant acquisitions in recent years that have only added to the pain and piled on the debt.The last significant deal in the Jeff Immelt era was General Electric's buyout of Alstom for $10 billion in 2014. The company had been hoping to use this deal to become the undisputed champion of power generation from natural gas, but it coincided with the collapse in oil and gas prices.This deal in itself was not enough to break the company but combined with years of frivolous spending on highly prized acquisitions, it became the straw that broke the camel's back.Here is the second factor: debt and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, the company's debt was $114 billion, 3.7 times its equity.Looking through the company's financials, it is clear that it has been spending more than it can afford for years. Until very recently, the company's dividend was gold-plated even though it should have been cut many years ago. Over the past five years, free cash flow from operations has totaled $45 billion, a respectable sum, but over the same period, the business has distributed $44 billion to investors via dividends, indicating capital spending (around $7 billion per annum). And acquisitions have been funded entirely with debt.The red flags were on the wall for a while.As the business tries to divest assets to clean up its balance sheet, its complexity is now becoming all too clear. Asset sales are taking too long and not raising enough cash to make a meaningful dent in the company's debt mountain.Overall, this is yet another case study to investors of how dangerous debt can be, even for those companies that may seem to be too big to fail.Disclosure: The author owns no share mentioned.Stocks That Fell to 3-Year Lows in the Week of Nov. 9Valuation: How to Assess the Value of Declining CompaniesDavid Herro and Bill Nygren Comment on General ElectricThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.Warning!

He offered his story of how the conglomerate has become a ""colossal failure in governance"" on CNBC Wednesday.What HappenedLangone was invited to join GE's board of directors in 1999 by the company's ex-CEO Jack Welch, who was described as ""CEO of the century,"" the billionaire octogenarian said as a guest on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" segment. When Welch retired as GE's CEO in 2001, Langone was still serving on the board. Welch's replacement Jeffrey Immelt took over with an ""aura of a coronation,"" Langone said.On paper, Immelt ""looked fabulous,"" Langone said. The executive oversaw a transformation at GE — but this is really a ""synonym for destruction,"" the former board member said. When Immelt took over as CEO, GE's industrial segment held just $1 billion in debt. The debt load stands at $85 billion today, Langone said.But there are more examples of poor business decisions, the former board member said. Immelt oversaw multiple asset and business sales over the years in mostly cash deals, Langone said. The company partly used some of the cash to oversee a $50-billion share repurchase program when the stock was trading at around $30 per share.Related Link: Is Jack Welch Himself To Blame For GE's Poor Performance Under Immelt?Why It's ImportantGE's blunders over the years are apparent in today's stock price near the $15 level, Langone said.""And now the word is they are going to have to do an equity raise,"" he said. ""I'll tell you right now, and I never thought I would say this, here's a case where I think an activist is going to make a huge, huge difference. It all has to come out.""The ongoing involvement of an activist investor like Nelson Peltz could be the catalyst needed to boost shares higher, Langone said.What's Next?GE's next steps are unclear. The company nominated three new directors to its board of directors and simultaneously slashed the size of the board.

The stock was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 (.SPX).The shares had more than halved since Flannery, a three-decade GE veteran, became CEO in August 2017 to replace Jeff Immelt, who had led GE since 2001. With a market capitalization below $100 billion as of Friday, GE was worth less than a fifth of its peak value a generation ago.GE Power's falling profits last year forced GE to slash its overall profit outlook and cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression.GE's board, meeting in the last few days, unanimously picked Culp as its new CEO. Culp, 55, who was named to GE's board in February, was CEO of industrial equipment supplier Danaher Corp (DHR.N) from 2000 to 2014, helping grow the company into a broader conglomerate through a series of acquisitions, while also growing earnings.Some analysts said that GE Power likely missed financial targets for the third quarter, contributing to Flannery’s ouster. GE, scheduled to report results on Oct. 25, declined to comment.The broad strategies are likely to be similar because the plan laid out by Flannery was made in conjunction with heavy involvement from the board, which included Culp, said Gabelli & Co analyst Justin Bergner.SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELFGE's board was unhappy with the pace of the company's turnaround under Flannery, and when the size of the writedown in the power plant division, which makes electric generating equipment, became apparent, the board was persuaded to seek a new CEO, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.However, GE will not be changing its announced breakup plan, which calls for spinning off healthcare and shedding its stake in oil services company Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), the source added.Culp indicated that he will tackle the company's problems aggressively. ""We will move with urgency. ... We have a lot of work ahead of us to unlock the value of GE,"" he said in a statement.The troubles in the power plant unit have been intensifying, as Reuters reported in July, with the news that one of its most valuable clients, Saudi Arabia, was lining up competitors to bid against GE for lucrative power plant work.GE doubled down on fossil fuels in 2015 under Immelt with the $10.3 billion purchase of French group Alstom SA's (ALSO.PA) power business. The deal expanded GE's exposure to gas, coal and nuclear power. It added employees, dozens of factories and service centres at a time when GE was trying to cut costs.""The board is signaling to the market that we are not going to give anyone free reign like we did with Jeff Immelt,"" said Morningstar analyst Joshua Aguilar.The power division's outlook appeared to worsen last month when GE said several power plants equipped with its newest turbines had to be shut down because of a part failure.Changing CEOs ""won't fix short-term problems at power, but Larry, as an outsider, will be able to make the difficult decisions on cost,"" said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research in New York. ""GE is bloated and its culture is destroyed.""Davis said the stock price has probably already adjusted to expectations of no contribution from power.A slimmed down General Electric - a 126-year-old conglomerate that was once the most valuable U.S. corporation and a global symbol of American business power -- will focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy.In June, GE lost its spot in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) after over a century.""Investors grew impatient with the lack of improvement and with the sheer scale of the problems uncovered. However, these problems were not created under [Flannery's] tenure,"" CFRA analyst Jim Corridore said in a note. ""The market seems to be welcoming a change in leadership but the new CEO will be facing many of the same problems.""GE said the power division's goodwill balance is about $23 billion and the impairment charge would eliminate most of it. The non-cash charge primarily relates to GE's acquisition of power assets from Alstom in 2015, GE said.GE's long stock slide means the once-largest U.S. industrial company is now only sixth in terms of market capitalization, behind Boeing Co (BA.N), 3M Co (MMM.N), Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and others.(Reporting by Alwyn Scott and Arunima Banerjee; Additional reporting by Sweta Singh in Bengaluru, Liz Hampton in Houston, Harry Brumpton, Lewis Krauskopf and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; writing by Nick Zieminski; editing by Susan Thomas and Leslie Adler)Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

Graham's net-net strategy (stocks selling for less than net current assets) inherently provided the margin of safety that value investors require.It was only when Charlie Munger introduced Buffett to the idea of the power of brands that Buffett tweaked his style. One of Buffett's well-known successes with the investment shift was See's Candies. To understand the power of See's brand, Buffett once explained:""If you give your girlfriend See's Candy and she kisses you, we've got you for life.""Later, Buffett recognized a similar brand loyalty from The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) customer:""If you gave me $100 billion and said take away the soft drink leadership of Coca-Cola in the world, I'd give it back to you and say it can't be done.""That degree of brand power is rare, of course. Still, searching for solid brands at an attractive stock price was how Buffett evolved as a value investor.Today's value investors might consider consumer packaged foods leader General Mills, Inc. (NYSE: GIS). General Mills offers a portfolio of well-known brands and finbox.io valuation models show nearly 30 percent upside.The General Mills Business ModelGeneral Mills' generated $15.6 billion in consolidated net sales with an additional $1.0 billion from its proportionate share of joint venture net sales ($0.8 billion from Cereal Partners Worldwide and $0.2 billion from Häagen-Dazs Japan). The company is managed under four operating segments: North America Retail (65 percent fiscal 2017 net sales), Convenience Stores & Foodservice (12 percent), Europe & Australia (12 percent) and Asia & Latin America (11 percent). Products are split among five global categories including snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, convenient meals, yogurt, and super-premium ice cream:Source: General Mills 2017 Annual ReportGeneral Mills sells its products through retail stores and supplies products to the North American foodservice and commercial baking industries. Popular brands include Cheerios, Wheaties, Betty Crocker, Green Giant, Pillsbury, Haagen-Dazs, and Yoplait. Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) represented 20 percent of the company's 2017 consolidated net sales and 29 percent of its North America Retail segment.Latest Quarterly Results, ""Moat"" Analysis, and Growth OutlookThird-Quarter ResultsIn its third quarter, General Mills posted a 1 percent increase in organic net sales and net sales increased 2 percent to $3.9 billion. The North America Retail unit sales were up 1 percent compared to the previous year. Results were helped by the Canada operating unit (6 percent increase), U.S. snacks (3 percent), and U.S. Meals & Baking (2 percent), but were pressured by U.S. Yogurt (-8 percent) and cereal (-1 percent).Management cited increases in freight and commodity costs as weighing on its adjusted diluted EPS of $0.79 (an 8 percent increase in constant currency). To help offset these costs, strategic initiatives include increasing freight carriers and alternative transportation as well as optimizing the distribution network and its administrative structure.The General Mills ""Moat""As management works to trim costs, General Mills' strong lineup of brands and wide scale look to continue to give it a competitive advantage over peers. Cheerios, Honey Nut Cheerios, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch are all top-5 leading brands in ready-to-eat cereal. Leading brands including Old El Paso, Haagen-Dazs, Yoplait, and Pillsbury round out the rest of General Mills' categories. The quality of these brands can command pricing power and superior shelf space over peers. General Mills' wide distribution lowers unit costs versus smaller peers and its larger scale helps to maximize advertising's impact. In all, it seems General Mills has built a significant competitive advantage versus its peers.Sources of GrowthThis isn't to say that General Mills and other packaged food companies aren't facing challenges. Center-store weakness (as customers move to fresher foods on the perimeter) has taken its toll. To compensate, management plans to reinvest in its brands and new products. Its acquisition of Blue Buffalo, while at a premium price, should also provide some support to top-line growth while supporting General Mills' overall moat. Blue Buffalo is the leader (30 percent+ market share) in the U.S. pet food's wholesome natural segment with 12 percent sales growth and a 25 percent EBITDA margin. Also helping margins is management's targeting of $750 million in annual savings (including $50 million Blue Buffalo synergies).Estimating Generals Mills' Intrinsic ValueWhile Buffett moved on from Graham's net-net strategy to buying quality brands, he still required his investments to trade at a reasonable discount, or margin of safety. Buffett held over this principle to provide protection against unfavorable business developments.So does General Mills offer much in the way of a margin of safety? It sure looks like it. Wall Street analysts expect low single-digit revenue growth to ramp up into the high-single digits with steady EBITDA margin expansion:Source: General Mills 5-Year DCF Model, finbox.ioIncorporating these projections across nine finbox.io valuation models generates an average fair value of $53.53 per share. That estimate implies nearly 30 percent upside to current trading levels:Source: finbox.ioThat's more upside compared to General Mills' direct peers and its dividend yield also compares favorably:Risks:Greater-than-expected weakness in the center store could weigh on General Mills' top line. Volatile commodity costs and increased competition from incumbents and smaller players also pose risks. The Blue Buffalo integration and capturing the targeted $50M in synergies could also prove challenging.General Mills Conclusion:With a portfolio of leading brands and a recent acquisition of another, General Mills offers the high-quality brands that value investors seek out. Though customers have prioritized perimeter store offerings of late, brand reinvestment and new product development look to support the top line. With a 4.7 percent dividend yield and 30 percent upside, it's time value investors give General Mills another look.Photo Credit: General Mills 2017 Annual ReportAuthor: Andy PaiExpertise: financial modeling, mergers & acquisitionsAndy is also a founder at finbox.io, where he's focused on building tools that make it faster and easier for investors to do investment research.

Risk-averse investors who are attracted to diversified streams of revenue and strong capital returns tend to seek out these large companies. But, the key to extending previous success is in the health of the company’s financials. This article will examine General Motors’s financial liquidity and debt levels to get an idea of whether the company can deal with cyclical downturns and maintain funds to accommodate strategic spending for future growth. Note that this information is centred entirely on financial health and is a high-level overview, so I encourage you to look further into GM here. Check out our latest analysis for General MotorsGM’s debt levels surged from US$75.12B to US$94.22B over the last 12 months , which comprises of short- and long-term debt. With this growth in debt, GM’s cash and short-term investments stands at US$19.53B for investing into the business. Moreover, GM has produced cash from operations of US$17.33B in the last twelve months, resulting in an operating cash to total debt ratio of 18.39%, meaning that GM’s current level of operating cash is not high enough to cover debt. This ratio can also be a sign of operational efficiency for loss making businesses as traditional metrics such as return on asset (ROA) requires a positive net income. In GM’s case, it is able to generate 0.18x cash from its debt capital.At the current liabilities level of US$76.89B liabilities, it appears that the company is not able to meet these obligations given the level of current assets of US$68.74B, with a current ratio of 0.89x below the prudent level of 3x.With total debt exceeding equities, General Motors is considered a highly levered company. This is common amongst large-cap companies because debt can often be a less expensive alternative to equity due to tax deductibility of interest payments. Accordingly, large companies often have an advantage over small-caps through lower cost of capital due to cheaper financing. But since GM is currently loss-making, there’s a question of sustainability of its current operations. Maintaining a high level of debt, while revenues are still below costs, can be dangerous as liquidity tends to dry up in unexpected downturns.GM’s high debt levels is not met with high cash flow coverage. This leaves room for improvement in terms of debt management and operational efficiency. In addition to this, its low liquidity raises concerns over whether current asset management practices are properly implemented for the large-cap. Keep in mind I haven’t considered other factors such as how GM has been performing in the past.

After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put General Motors Company GM stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, General Motors has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 5.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.6. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, General Motors’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 10.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.However, we should point out that General Motors has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 5.8, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates indicate that the company’s share price will likely appreciate in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, General Motors has a P/S ratio of about 0.4. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now.As we can see, the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P/S metric. This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, General Motors currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes General Motors a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for General Motors is just 0.7, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.1. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 2.3, which is far better than the industry average of 7.8. Clearly, GM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though General Motors might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D. This gives GM a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current year has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the next year estimate has seen two upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 4.9% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has increased 11.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:General Motors Company Price and Consensus General Motors Company Price and Consensus | General Motors Company QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineGeneral Motors is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a robust industry rank (among the Top 25%) and a top Zacks Rank instills investor confidence.However, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite the poor past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in General Motors.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

I will be using the Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Please also note that this article was written in June 2018 so be sure check out the updated calculation by following the link below.   View out our latest analysis for General Motors  I’m using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company’s growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have perpetual stable growth rate. To start off with we need to estimate the next five years of cash flows. For this I used the consensus of the analysts covering the stock, as you can see below. I then discount the sum of these cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate.20182019202020212022Levered FCF ($, Millions)$4.84k$4.69k$4.81k$7.98k$7.85kSourceAnalyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Present Value Discounted @ 13.71%$4.25k$3.63k$3.27k$4.77k$4.13kPresent Value of 5-year Cash Flow (PVCF)= US$20.05bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after the five years. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of the GDP. In this case I have used the 10-year government bond rate (2.9%). In the same way as with the 5-year ‘growth’ period, we discount this to today’s value at a cost of equity of 13.7%.Terminal Value (TV) = FCF2022 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.85b × (1 + 2.9%) ÷ (13.7% – 2.9%) = US$75.05bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r)5 = US$75.05b ÷ ( 1 + 13.7%)5 = US$39.47bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next five years and the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$59.52b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. If the stock is an depositary receipt (represents a specified number of shares in a foreign corporation) or ADR then we use the equivalent number. This results in an intrinsic value of $42.23. Relative to the current share price of $41.25, the stock is about right, perhaps slightly undervalued at a 2.32% discount to what it is available for right now.The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don’t agree with my result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. Because we are looking at General Motors as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighed average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation I’ve used 13.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.527. This is derived from the Bottom-Up Beta method based on comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn’t be the only metric you look at when researching a company.

But one area where both Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) have historically lagged foreign competitors has been their luxury lineups. Furthermore, Detroit automakers have begun distancing themselves from producing sedans and passenger cars in the U.S. market. So what's up with GM's $175 million investment to build two next-generation Cadillac sedans? And why should investors care?Cadillac's U.S. sales fell 8% in 2017, leading people to ask if General Motors' Cadillac experiment failed, and Ford hardly did better, as Lincoln snapped its three consecutive years of gains with a slight decline.Data source: Ford's sales press releases. Chart by author.Worse for Lincoln -- and Ford investors -- is that the luxury brand's sales in the U.S. aren't bouncing back and are down 13.4% through May. However, Cadillac's global story is far more promising than Lincoln's. The former only recently started selling in China and isn't in Europe, and is more intriguing than some GM investors may realize. In fact, despite the 8% decline in the U.S., Cadillac's global sales jumped 15.5% during 2017, thanks in large part to the luxury brand's staggering 50.8% growth in China. That growth was enough to overtake the U.S. as Cadillac's highest-volume market in 2017.With a booming overseas growth story, there's incentive for GM and Cadillac to match that growth here in the States, and that's what management aims to do as it begins to retool and equip the Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant for two new Cadillac sedans, which are rumored to be named the CT4 and CT5. Those two products are expected to mark the end of the ATS, CTS, and XTS sedans in Cadillac's portfolio and are targeting the next-generation luxury buyer.The 2019 XT4 was developed on an exclusive compact SUV architecture. Image source: General Motors.""The XT4 is a cruise missile right into one of the hottest growing segments that is really populated by a young and very affluent and very discerning demographic. It is an area we have been eager to get into,"" Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen said following the unveiling of the vehicle, according to Automotive News.While investors will have to wait a year or so for the CT4 and CT5 rollout, the XT4 compact crossover will launch during the fourth quarter, and the refreshed portfolio is expected to significantly drive sales and profits. In fact, de Nysschen said he expects it to become the best-selling vehicle in its segment. That would put it in the ballpark of 50,000 units, which is a significant chunk considering Cadillac totaled only 156,440 units in the U.S. last year.For investors, this is more than just new nameplates and vehicle launches. These rollouts are expected to make a significant difference and double Cadillac's profits through 2021 -- with the biggest profit-driving force coming from the United States.Image source: GM's Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry Conference presentation, Jan. 16, 2018.Investors who keep abreast of sales data often overlook luxury sales because they're dwarfed in volume by mainstream vehicles. That's a mistake, because the historical rule of thumb is that luxury vehicles, while only generating roughly 10% of industry sales, generate almost a third of industry profits. Luxury brands are high-margin, high-revenue products, and will become increasingly important to automakers' bottom-line growth story as the U.S. new-vehicle market slows.General Motors has spent $464 million in manufacturing investments on Cadillac over the past two years alone, according to Automotive News. At first glance, that might seem puzzling with people flocking to SUVs and trucks and surging investments in driverless vehicles and electrified lineups, not to mention Cadillac's 8% decline in the U.S. last year. But with an incredible growth story overseas, and oversize profits compared to sales volume, this is a move that makes far more sense for its bottom line than many realize.

Yet even at the stock's peak of $46.76, it still traded for around 7 times earnings, less than half of the broader market's earnings multiple.Since peaking in October, General Motors stock has plunged again, falling more than 20%. As a result, shares now trade for less than 6 times earnings. This represents a spectacular buying opportunity for long-term investors.General Motors Stock Performance, data by YCharts.General Motors has achieved spectacular financial results over the past three years. Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled during this period, rising from $3.05 in 2014 to $6.62 last year. Strong margins in North America, growth of the GM Financial ancillary business, and the company's exit from Europe all contributed to this performance.Crosstown rival Ford Motor (NYSE: F) hasn't been so fortunate. Ford's adjusted EPS has increased by a more modest 33% over the past three years. Adjusted EPS peaked at $1.93 in 2015 but slipped to $1.76 in 2016 and $1.78 in 2017.This discrepancy in performance would seem to suggest that GM is well equipped to deal with the challenges that automakers face on a routine basis. Nevertheless, General Motors stock has plummeted over three big fears.First, U.S. auto sales reached a cyclical peak in 2017. Many pundits have warned that this means EPS is bound to decline, pulling General Motors stock down with it.Many investors think declining U.S. auto sales will undermine GM's earnings. Image source: General Motors.Second, the announcement of new tariffs on aluminum and steel has caused investors to worry that rising commodity costs will pinch profits. Third, the recent fatal accident involving an Uber autonomous vehicle has shaken investors' faith in the promise of autonomous vehicles, at least in the near term.Many of these fears are overblown. For example, the steel and aluminum tariffs are quickly losing their bite. Two weeks ago, the Trump administration exempted Canada and Mexico from the tariffs. More recently, it added the EU, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and South Korea to the exempt list. Steel and aluminum importers can also apply for company-specific tariff exemptions.There will still probably be some impact on steel and aluminum prices from the tariffs, but it won't cause an unusually big spike in commodity costs. Automakers have been able to raise prices at a steady rate in recent years to offset cost increases like this one.The Trump administration's recent decision to slap broad tariffs on China could have a bigger impact, if it leads to a backlash in China against products seen as ""American."" To some extent, GM has insured against this risk through the extraordinary growth of Baojun, its homegrown Chinese brand. In addition, consumer backlash against foreign companies in China tends to be short-lived. Within a couple of years, it's back to business as usual.There are a few reasons General Motors stock looks more appealing than Ford shares right now. First, Ford stock is slightly more expensive at 7 times forward earnings compared to 6 times earnings for GM, despite GM's superior track record in recent years.Second, product cycles are almost as important as economic cycles in determining success in the auto market. General Motors has an edge there, with a slew of new high-margin truck and SUV product launches scheduled for 2018 and 2019. This lineup will help the company keep its sales relatively stable through market share gains.Third, GM has a big lead over most of its rivals in terms of electric-vehicle and autonomous-vehicle development. It's still not clear how quickly these new technologies will be adopted, but these investments put the General in a good position to counter future disruptive threats.Given the mix of opportunities and threats that GM faces, General Motors stock is probably worth at least 50% more than its current price. (That would still be a modest valuation of 9 times earnings.) Patient investors will benefit from a 4.2% dividend yield while they wait for the rest of the market to catch on to GM's long-term strength.

Both are set to go into production late this year, and GM expects both to bring home more profits per truck than the current Silverado and Sierra.But GM's chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, recently made clear that the road from here to those fat profits would be a bumpy one, because putting these new pickups into production won't be simple.Getting GM's all-new 2019 Chevrolet Silverado into production will be a complicated and expensive process. Image source: General Motors.While GM won't begin production of the new trucks until the fourth quarter of 2018, it has already begun making the extensive changes to its factories that will be required to build them.GM is clearly hoping to learn from archrival Ford Motor Company's (NYSE: F) experience. The launch of Ford's all-new 2015 F-150 followed months of fevered work. That new F-150 had aluminum body panels instead of the steel panels of its predecessor, meaning that it required very different tooling and processes to build. Ford had to essentially gut and rebuild two of its busiest factories at a moment when pickup demand was booming.Ford pulled it off, but not without a cost. The company warned beforehand that it would lose about 90,000 units of production. It had built up inventories of 2014-model-year pickups before beginning the factory conversions, but still: Ford's pickup sales lagged for several months while it worked to get the factories up and running again. To be clear, that effort was worth the cost: Helped by a very strong market, the new F-150 helped carry Ford to record profits in 2015 and 2016. But here in 2018, the U.S. new-car market is looking a little ragged -- and so GM has come up with a plan that it hopes will improve somewhat on Ford's experience. GM's new trucks don't have all-aluminum body panels. But as Stevens explained during GM's earnings call this week, the new trucks really are all-new, completely different from the current models. That means GM has to make extensive (and expensive) changes to major sections of its truck factories (""body shops"" in company parlance) that assemble the truck's bodies and chassis.This is an all-new architecture. Our last three generations of truck were fundamentally of the same architecture with changes in sheet metal. So this is an absolutely all-new architecture, which requires all-new body shops. So when we take downtime at certain facilities, it's because we're either converting or constructing new body shops to facilitate this launch. And we've been opportunistic around doing that around holiday periods so that you can get extra time to make these transitions without a full impact on downtime.Those changes have already begun, and they're already having an impact. Stevens said that investors should expect a 60,000-unit decline in GM's shipments in North America in the first quarter, largely due to downtime at GM's pickup factories.That's a big hit. To put it in perspective, while GM doesn't release exact production figures for every model, we know that it sold about 178,000 Silverados and Sierras combined in the U.S. in the first three months of 2017. GM is losing production equivalent to a third of its full-size-pickup sales in the first quarter of last year. Given the profitability of these trucks, that's a heavy hit.Workers assemble a Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD at GM's factory in Flint, Michigan, one of several GM factories that will be reworked to build all-new pickups. Image source: General Motors.In total, Stevens said, GM expects to lose about 120,000 units of production in 2018 due to factory changes needed to make the all-new trucks. But there's a twist: GM has a complicated plan to boost production of its current trucks while some of its factories are retooled. In a nutshell, GM's Fort Wayne Assembly Plant, in Roanoke, Indiana, will send partially assembled trucks and parts to its highly flexible Oshawa Assembly Plant, in Ontario, which will paint and finish the trucks. (Oshawa has an unused assembly line that is being converted to do this work.) If that sounds a little bit Rube Goldberg, well, it is. It's a hack, one that GM has nicknamed the ""Oshawa Shuttle."" They hope the Shuttle will allow them get about 60,000 extra 2018-model pickups built this year. If it works, it will leave GM with a production decline of about 60,000.That's not ideal, but it beats the 90,000 trucks that Ford lost in 2014 and 2015. More importantly, while GM will probably take a hit to its first-quarter results, it should be able to make up some of the lost profit by year-end.

That new F-150 had aluminum body panels instead of the steel panels of its predecessor, meaning that it required very different tooling and processes to build. Ford had to essentially gut and rebuild two of its busiest factories at a moment when pickup demand was booming.Ford pulled it off, but not without a cost. The company warned beforehand that it would lose about 90,000 units of production. It had built up inventories of 2014-model-year pickups before beginning the factory conversions, but still: Ford's pickup sales lagged for several months while it worked to get the factories up and running again. To be clear, that effort was worth the cost: Helped by a very strong market, the new F-150 helped carry Ford to record profits in 2015 and 2016. But here in 2018, the U.S. new-car market is looking a little ragged -- and so GM has come up with a plan that it hopes will improve somewhat on Ford's experience. GM's new trucks don't have all-aluminum body panels. But as Stevens explained during GM's earnings call this week, the new trucks really are all-new, completely different from the current models. That means GM has to make extensive (and expensive) changes to major sections of its truck factories (""body shops"" in company parlance) that assemble the truck's bodies and chassis.This is an all-new architecture. Our last three generations of truck were fundamentally of the same architecture with changes in sheet metal. So this is an absolutely all-new architecture, which requires all-new body shops. So when we take downtime at certain facilities, it's because we're either converting or constructing new body shops to facilitate this launch. And we've been opportunistic around doing that around holiday periods so that you can get extra time to make these transitions without a full impact on downtime.Those changes have already begun, and they're already having an impact. Stevens said that investors should expect a 60,000-unit decline in GM's shipments in North America in the first quarter, largely due to downtime at GM's pickup factories.That's a big hit. To put it in perspective, while GM doesn't release exact production figures for every model, we know that it sold about 178,000 Silverados and Sierras combined in the U.S. in the first three months of 2017. GM is losing production equivalent to a third of its full-size-pickup sales in the first quarter of last year. Given the profitability of these trucks, that's a heavy hit.Workers assemble a Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD at GM's factory in Flint, Michigan, one of several GM factories that will be reworked to build all-new pickups. Image source: General Motors.In total, Stevens said, GM expects to lose about 120,000 units of production in 2018 due to factory changes needed to make the all-new trucks. But there's a twist: GM has a complicated plan to boost production of its current trucks while some of its factories are retooled. In a nutshell, GM's Fort Wayne Assembly Plant, in Roanoke, Indiana, will send partially assembled trucks and parts to its highly flexible Oshawa Assembly Plant, in Ontario, which will paint and finish the trucks. (Oshawa has an unused assembly line that is being converted to do this work.) If that sounds a little bit Rube Goldberg, well, it is. It's a hack, one that GM has nicknamed the ""Oshawa Shuttle."" They hope the Shuttle will allow them get about 60,000 extra 2018-model pickups built this year. If it works, it will leave GM with a production decline of about 60,000.That's not ideal, but it beats the 90,000 trucks that Ford lost in 2014 and 2015. More importantly, while GM will probably take a hit to its first-quarter results, it should be able to make up some of the lost profit by year-end.

It's a stylish crossover SUV, a size down from the brand's existing XT5, that will go on sale in the U.S. and China later this year.The XT4 is a product that Cadillac has sorely needed for a couple of years now. The brand has had to watch from the sidelines as sales of compact luxury crossover SUVs boomed in both the U.S. and China over that time. The good news is that the XT4 looks like a winning product. But why did Cadillac have to wait so long to get it? As Cadillac's president explained to me in an interview last week, he had to go halfway around the world to convince GM to fund the new vehicles that Cadillac needed. The all-new 2019 Cadillac XT4 will go on sale this fall. Image source: General Motors.The story starts in mid-2014, when longtime Audi and Nissan executive Johan de Nysschen joined GM to take on a daunting mission: restoring Cadillac to the top of the world's luxury-car rankings. De Nysschen demanded (and got) plenty of leeway from CEO Mary Barra and the blessings of GM's board of directors. One of the first things he did was to draw up an ambitious product plan for the brand. But he quickly ran into trouble: As he told me in an interview last week, his sales projections weren't enough to get those new Cadillacs funded:We recognized that there was all this white space in our product portfolio. But General Motors is now run with a very high degree of vigor in terms of financial discipline. That's why the company is performing well. But the downside of that is that there are no pet projects. If a vehicle program doesn't pay its way, then it doesn't happen. And Cadillac's struggle had been that it was literally starved of product. It sounds like a Catch-22, but it was a genuine dilemma. Cadillac's sales were poor because it urgently needed new products, but de Nysschen couldn't get GM's board to fund those new products because its sales numbers were poor -- meaning that any reasonable sales projections weren't enough to justify the investments. ""We couldn't get the numbers to work,"" he said. What de Nysschen and his new team needed was a way to start selling a whole lot more Cadillacs, quickly. Fortunately, the answer was right in front of them.Johan de Nysschen, shown here at the New York International Auto Show last week, has led Cadillac since 2014. Image source: General Motors.""We had to prioritize China in order to solve our U.S. product challenge,"" de Nysschen said. GM had a large presence in China, and Cadillac a modest one, when de Nysschen came on board. But luxury sales were booming in China, and de Nysschen saw an opportunity to invest in a much bigger presence. We invested very heavily, far more aggressively perhaps than what might normally be the case. We decided that the only way to be competitive is to localize, so we could avoid the big tariffs [that China levies on imported vehicles].So we built the plant [an advanced Cadillac-only factory near Shanghai that opened in early 2016]. In a way it was sort of akin to burning the ships, because once you've built the plant you had better make it work.Cadillac also invested in a big expansion of its China dealer network, de Nysschen explained, carefully selecting high-quality dealers who were willing to take chances on stores devoted entirely to the Cadillac brand. In 2014, Cadillac had sold about 68,000 vehicles in China, far short of the 170,000 it sold in the U.S. that same year. But growth came quickly once de Nysschen's effort got underway: Sales rose 17% in 2015, 46% in 2016, after the new Shanghai factory was up and running, and another 51% in 2017 to 116,406.""The China business has now become self-sustaining. It doesn't need our investment anymore,"" de Nysschen said. ""In fact, now the opposite is happening. It's sending us money, which we can now directly apply here.""GM opened a new, highly flexible Cadillac factory near Shanghai in early 2016. The added production helped Cadillac's China sales rise 46% that year, and another 51% in 2017. Image source: General Motors.Cadillac's sales in China have boomed since 2014, but its U.S. sales haven't: Cadillac's U.S. sales in 2017 were about 170,000 -- roughly equal to its 2014 result -- despite strong growth in luxury-vehicle sales overall. The XT4 is the first in a series of new Cadillacs that should help change that for the better. De Nysschen confirmed that the next new Cadillac will be a larger, three-row crossover SUV and it's likely to be unveiled late this year or early in 2019. More new Cadillacs will follow -- on average, one every six months or so -- until the brand's portfolio expands to cover more than 90% of the luxury market, up from 65% today. Those will include an all-new version of the big (and hugely profitable) Escalade SUV and at least two all-new sedans to replace the ATS, CTS, and XTS. (There may be a third Cadillac sedan in the works: A version of the stunning Escala show car could go into production as a new top-of-the-line model for the brand early next decade.) Those new Cadillacs seem all but certain to give the brand's U.S. sales the boost its dealers have been waiting to see. Of course, they'll boost the brand's sales in China, too -- and given the fat profit margins on Cadillacs, those sales gains should have an outsized impact on GM's bottom line over the next few years.

A company’s ownership structure is often linked to its share performance in both the long- and short-term. Since the same amount of capital coming from an activist institution and a passive mutual fund has different implications on corporate governance, it is a useful exercise to deconstruct GPC’s shareholder registry.  See our latest analysis for Genuine Parts  GPC’s 80.32% institutional ownership seems enough to cause large share price movements in the case of significant share sell-off or acquisitions by institutions, particularly when there is a low level of public shares available on the market to trade. However, as not all institutions are alike, such high volatility events, especially in the short-term, have been more frequently linked to active market participants like hedge funds. In the case of GPC, investors need not worry about such volatility considering active hedge funds don’t have a significant stake. However, we should dig deeper into GPC’s ownership structure and find out how other key ownership classes can affect its investment profile.I find insiders are an important group of stakeholders, who are directly involved in making key decisions related to the use of capital. In essence, insider ownership is more about the alignment of shareholders’ interests with the management. GPC insiders may only hold a a minor stake in the company, but this is a relatively significant holding given it is a large-cap stock. A higher level of insider ownership has been linked to management executing on high-returning projects instead of expansion projects for the sake of apparent growth. It would also be interesting to check what insiders have been doing with their shareholding recently. Insider buying can be a positive indicator of future performance, but a selling decision can be simply driven by personal financial requirements.A substantial ownership of 17.65% in GPC is held by the general public. This level of ownership gives retail investors the power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and potential acquisitions. This is a positive sign for an investor who wants to be involved in key decision-making of the company.Another important group of owners for potential investors in GPC are private companies that hold a stake of 0.0029% in GPC. These are companies that are mainly invested due to their strategic interests or are incentivized by reaping capital gains on investments their shareholdings. However, an ownership of this size may be relatively insignificant, meaning that these shareholders may not have the potential to influence GPC’s business strategy. Thus, investors not need worry too much about the consequences of these holdings.The company’s high institutional ownership makes margin of safety a very important consideration to existing investors since long bull and bear trends often emerge when these big-ticket investors see a change in long-term potential of the company. This will enable shareholders to comfortably invest in the company while avoid getting trapped in a sustained sell-off that is often observed in stocks with this level of institutional participation. However, if you are building an investment case for GPC, ownership structure alone should not dictate your decision to buy or sell the stock. Rather, you should be looking at fundamental drivers such as the intrinsic valuation, which is a key driver of Genuine Parts’s share price.

A company’s ownership structure is often linked to its share performance in both the long- and short-term. Since the same amount of capital coming from an activist institution and a passive mutual fund has different implications on corporate governance, it is a useful exercise to deconstruct GPC’s shareholder registry.  See our latest analysis for Genuine Parts  GPC’s 80.32% institutional ownership seems enough to cause large share price movements in the case of significant share sell-off or acquisitions by institutions, particularly when there is a low level of public shares available on the market to trade. However, as not all institutions are alike, such high volatility events, especially in the short-term, have been more frequently linked to active market participants like hedge funds. In the case of GPC, investors need not worry about such volatility considering active hedge funds don’t have a significant stake.

If Apple or one of its authorized partners were to put the same display in the same phone, though? No problem.The aftermarket repair community has verified the behavior in phones from the US all the way to Australia. It's confirmed to be an issue with phones running iOS 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3, which led sources to suggest it's been a problem since the launch of the latest batch of iPhones last fall. I was able to confirm that even swapping the displays of two brand-new iPhones causes the ambient light sensor to stop working, despite it not being altered or touched in any way. Experiments have shown that the sensor is disabled by iOS during the boot process.There's some debate over whether this is a bug or a feature. Apple first tied hardware and software together with the launch of Touch ID on the iPhone 5S. Third-party repairers quickly found out that replacing a broken fingerprint sensor with a working unit would disable Touch ID. This was the root cause of the infamous ""Error 53,"" which broke phones without a valid fingerprint sensor on restore. Apple said the security test that caused Error 53 was only supposed to be performed at the assembly factory, and fixed the bug by disabling the test during the restore process.Apple's reasoning for locking down the fingerprint sensor in this way was security, and it used the same rationale with the iPhone X and the introduction of the Face ID camera array. Some of the repairers we spoke with, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions, don't believe this is the case. Instead, they think it represented Apple's first tentative steps towards controlling the entire repair process.When Apple replaces a Touch ID or Face ID sensor, it uses a machine dubbed Horizon, which tells the phone all its parts belong with one another. Apple recently started shipping these machines (around 400 last year) to some of the 4,800 authorized service providers around the world. But that leaves a large number of authorized service providers in the dark, as well as aftermarket repair shops, which greatly outnumber those officially approved by Apple. And that's not to mention individuals who feel confident enough to fix their own devices.But why would merely swapping the displays of two identical, working iPhones disable a seemingly unrelated sensor? ""I've been waiting for this for five years to be honest, since the 5S,"" one repairer said. ""It's a scary looking future for me."" They expressed concern that Apple is using the ambient light sensor ""as a test-case to see how it works, to see if they can link hardware with logic boards so if they were repaired outside of the Apple network it loses functionality.""The same source said that the ambient light sensor issue could ""open us to a lot of returns and a world of trouble,"" but added that they were willing to talk about it in the hope of forcing Apple to address it. After all, it was public outcry that pushed Apple to fix Error 53. They also believe that the recent iOS 11.3 problem is an attempt by Apple to damage public trust in aftermarket repairs.Considering that screen cracks and smashes are among the most common types of damage seen by repairers, it's likely that tens of thousands of phones are currently affected. One source, on discovering the behavior, was shaken. They said that they had personally replaced over 100 displays. ""We try to offer a cheap alternative [to Apple], and we only use genuine parts. I'm worried that customers are going to come back to me and demand that I fix it. What can I do if Apple is the one disabling the sensor?"" Another source said that they repaired between 20 and 50 iPhone 8 screens per month.The ""right to repair"" is a hot issue. Just yesterday, the FTC warned companies about preventing third-parties from repairing products. Separately, several states (most recently California) are seeking to introduce legislation that would coerce companies into making customer repairs easier. Historically, Apple has been against right to repair bills, telling lawmakers in Nebraska that a proposed law would turn the state into a ""Mecca"" for hackers.Locking down Touch ID and Face ID was easy for Apple to explain. Likewise, disabling untested third-party components can be presented as a quality control measure. But it's tough to see why the company would need to lock customers and aftermarket repairers out from replacing parts like-for-like. I spoke with Apple about the problem, but after initially replying to ask some follow-up questions, the spokesperson failed to provide a response in time for publication.""I've been waiting for this for five years to be honest.""Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

Over the past three years, the biotech's stock has lost over 35% of its value, thanks to falling hepatitis C sales, generic competition entering the HIV market in key geographies, and a slate of setbacks in hematology/oncology.To break out of this prolonged downturn, Gilead presently is undergoing a dramatic leadership overhaul -- highlighted by the the upcoming departure of current CEO John Milligan by year-end. Will this executive turnover enable Gilead to reverse course? Let's take a deeper look and consider how this top biotech might evolve over the next five years under new leadership.Image source: Getty ImagesAs things stand now, Gilead is attempting to reinvigorate its growth engine through three key therapeutic markets: hematology/oncology, inflammatory disorders, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). While all three of these therapeutic areas are absolutely enormous in terms of their respective commercial opportunities, Gilead lacks a clear competitive advantage in each case.In hematology, Gilead burst onto the scene roughly a year ago by paying a whopping $11.9 billion for Kite Pharma and its adoptive cell therapy Yescarta. Although Gilead reported a respectable $75 million in Yescarta sales for the third quarter of 2018, this franchise already is facing a slew of competitive threats.Atara Biotherapeutics, Celgene, Crispr Therapeutics, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, and numerous others all are developing next-generation adoptive cell therapies that likely will eclipse Yescarta in terms of safety and efficacy. Gilead has been working to shore up its Kite investment with additional acquisitions, but there's a growing chance that this sizable investment won't produce a healthy return on capital over the long run. And this harsh reality is probably one of the major drivers behind Gilead's ongoing executive exodus.On the inflammation front, Gilead and partner Galapagos are angling to grab market share away from AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Pfizer with their experimental JAK1 inhibitor, filgotinib. But this strategy also has obvious problems.First and foremost, AbbVie decided to hand back the development rights to filgotinib to Galapagos in favor of its own internal candidate, upadacitinib (ABT-494). Since then, filgotinib has produced some truly compelling midstage data that suggests that it might be a safer option than upadacitinib. But AbbVie is likely to grab an all-important first-mover advantage for upadacitinib.AbbVie also is far more familiar with the anti-inflammatory market than Gilead, which has been proven by the biotech's ability to repel nearly every major competitive threat to its flagship arthritis medication Humira for a sustained period of time. In short, Gilead has its work cut out for it when it comes to promoting filgotinib and challenging entrenched competitors like AbbVie and Pfizer.Lastly, Gilead is advancing three different compounds in the clinic for NASH. The lowdown is that the NASH space is expected to be the next big thing in biopharma, and Gilead is hoping to be a top player in this potentially $35 billion-a-year market.Unfortunately, the biotech's NASH pipeline doesn't appear to stack up well to the leaders in the field, namely Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ICPT), Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: MDGL), and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX). Intercept is poised to become the first to market with its drug Ocaliva, and Madrigal and Viking stand an excellent shot at eventually developing the most potent/safest NASH therapies overall.Gilead is presently a cash cow with a middling-to-lower-tier clinical pipeline. As such, the next CEO's first priority is probably going to be to add some star power to the biotech's clinical lineup.The good news is that the next person to take Gilead's top job will have a mountain of cash to work with in order to accomplish this feat (more than $30 billion). Moreover, this is a target rich mergers and acquisitions environment. In NASH alone, Gilead could gobble up Intercept, Madrigal, and Viking to build out a formidable competitive position -- and still have billions left over to tack on additional assets in hematology.Gilead's best chance at righting the ship in the next five years is unquestionably NASH. After all, NASH has a more favorable competitive landscape than hematology, more reasonably priced acquisition targets, and a wide-open commercial opportunity that might even rival blood cancer at some point down the road.That being said, it's obviously impossible to know exactly where this biotech is headed until a new CEO is named, and Gilead may choose to double down on hematology due to its massive investment in adoptive cell therapy. The path of least resistance, though, seems to indicate that Gilead is headed toward building an economic moat in NASH -- a move that would be cemented by hiring a CEO with experience in this novel therapeutic area.

The lowdown is that the NASH space is expected to be the next big thing in biopharma, and Gilead is hoping to be a top player in this potentially $35 billion-a-year market.Unfortunately, the biotech's NASH pipeline doesn't appear to stack up well to the leaders in the field, namely Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ICPT), Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: MDGL), and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX). Intercept is poised to become the first to market with its drug Ocaliva, and Madrigal and Viking stand an excellent shot at eventually developing the most potent/safest NASH therapies overall.Gilead is presently a cash cow with a middling-to-lower-tier clinical pipeline. As such, the next CEO's first priority is probably going to be to add some star power to the biotech's clinical lineup.The good news is that the next person to take Gilead's top job will have a mountain of cash to work with in order to accomplish this feat (more than $30 billion). Moreover, this is a target rich mergers and acquisitions environment. In NASH alone, Gilead could gobble up Intercept, Madrigal, and Viking to build out a formidable competitive position -- and still have billions left over to tack on additional assets in hematology.Gilead's best chance at righting the ship in the next five years is unquestionably NASH. After all, NASH has a more favorable competitive landscape than hematology, more reasonably priced acquisition targets, and a wide-open commercial opportunity that might even rival blood cancer at some point down the road.That being said, it's obviously impossible to know exactly where this biotech is headed until a new CEO is named, and Gilead may choose to double down on hematology due to its massive investment in adoptive cell therapy. The path of least resistance, though, seems to indicate that Gilead is headed toward building an economic moat in NASH -- a move that would be cemented by hiring a CEO with experience in this novel therapeutic area.

The outside counsel—Fish & Richardson partners Juanita Brooks, Deanna Reichel and Betsy Flanagan—and the in-house Gilead lawyers—Lorie Ann Morgan, vice-president, intellectual property, and Andrea Hutchison, associate general counsel IP litigation—were all women.And here’s something telling: Brooks, a titan of the IP bar and The American Lawyer’s 2014 Litigator of the Year, never had that happen in 40 years of practice.“It was fabulous,” she said, describing the team dynamic as “unbeatable.”Sure enough, the Federal Circuit on April 25 sided with Gilead in a fight with Merck & Co. over hepatitis C drug patents. In a precedential decision, the panel upheld the lower court’s decision to wipe out a $200 million infringement verdict against Gilead because Merck’s litigation and business misconduct constituted unclean hands.It was a hard-fought win, with oral arguments that lasted two hours, and included a series of tough questions for Brooks from Judge Richard Taranto. (She credits Reichel and Flanagan for her preparation.) He went on to write the unanimous opinion, which Brooks called “very carefully, thoughtfully crafted,” and all but “bulletproof” against en banc or Supreme Court reversal.Of course, if the Gilead team had been all men, no one would have batted an eye. “I hope there comes a time where it’s not noteworthy to have an IP litigation team run by women,” said Gilead’s Morgan. “Given the number of women in the legal profession, it should be closer to equal… But we’re making some progress.” In-house counsel like Morgan and Hutchison are helping to make it happen. “It troubles us when we see a team come in and it’s four middle-aged white guys—and one junior associate to bring diversity, whether it’s ethnic or gender,” Morgan said. “We don’t hire people just because they are women or ethnic minorities … But you need diversity of thought, and for that, you need diversity of background.”Hutchison added that they recognize there is “a limited number of senior people” who fit the bill, but that they do expect more diverse junior lawyers “to be given a serious role, not to be window dressing.”Brooks is well-acquainted with that tactic. “So many times I’ll enter my notice of appearance, and then the other side will enter a notice of appearance of a woman” too, she said. “They’ll sit them at the counsel’s table like a potted plant.”She added, “We certainly don’t have token women. We’re the real deal.”Laughing, she calls herself a triple threat—a woman, a Hispanic, and a member of the firm’s management committee.Brooks joined Fish & Richardson in 2000, and her star power has helped Fish attract the next generation of women IP litigators like Flanagan and Reichel in an especially male-dominated practice area. “We have a real mentor and role model and inspiration,” Reichel said of Brooks.Morgan of Gilead sings her praises as well. “Juanita and I have worked on many, many cases,” she said. “I remember the first time I saw her in court. It was a Markman hearing in an ANDA case, and she was just awesome. I was blown away.”Still, the full Gilead team outside the courtroom wasn’t exclusively female. For example, Fish principals Craig Countryman, Jonathan Singer and Robert Oakes also worked on the briefs. Flanagan stressed the “important role that our male colleagues play. They also encourage us to do good work and mentor us.” Brooks added, “One reason we have been able to end up with an all-women team is because many of the men we are fortunate enough to work with are gender-blind. They don’t pay attention to gender or the color of skin. It’s simply the merits. It just happens organically.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) — a steady presence in southern Asia.The RatingMorgan Stanley's Simeon Gutman and three other analysts maintained an Equal-Weight rating and $99 price target on Wal-Mart and an Overweight rating and $1,700 price target on Amazon.The ThesisThe analysts consider the potential for a Flipkart IPO a “key buffer” for Walmart.”[The] importance of demonstrating progress in Walmart’s U.S. business (particularly e-commerce) has magnified and cannot be understated,” the analysts said in a report.Morgan Stanley is ambivalent as to whether Walmart needs a presence in India.The nation’s $21 billion in e-commerce sales represents just 1 percent of the global addressable market, although Morgan Stanley expects expansion to $200 billion — 12 percent of the worldwide total ― by 2026.“India represents a significant long-term opportunity,” the analysts said.They estimate Flipkart controls nearly double the share of online gross merchandise volume that Amazon does and is in a period of sustained growth. Its leadership in online smartphone sales is particularly notable considering the category accounts for about half of India’s total online sales, although smartphones yield low to negative gross margins.Price ActionAmazon was up 0.29 percent Monday morning, while Walmart was trading higher by 1.16 percent.Related Links:Advantages With India ETFsAmazon Moving Retail Wars To An Unexpected Battleground: Physical StoresLatest Ratings for AMZNMay 2018Telsey Advisory GroupInitiates Coverage OnOutperformApr 2018WedbushMaintainsOutperformOutperformApr 2018BarclaysMaintainsOverweightOverweightView More Analyst Ratings for AMZN  View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaSears Board Explores Sale Of AssetsMike Olson's Bullish Musings On Activision, Amazon And NetflixAnalysis: The Rarity Of A Sub-4% Unemployment Rate© 2018 Benzinga.com.

Exchanges are the venues on which cryptocurrencies trade and the biggest can see daily trading volumes in the billions.The investment bank's research shows that the majority of volumes flow, at least nominally, through Malta. This is largely down to Binance, one of the biggest exchanges in the world, recently announcing plans to shift its legal headquarters to the small European island.""The largest exchange called Binance announced intentions to set up headquarters there, so if we take that company out, Malta would be much further down the list,"" Shah and her team wrote.""Binance said that it was moving away from Asia (currently registered in Hong Kong) due to more stringent regulation, especially from Japan. The third-largest exchange, OKEx, also recently announced that it was opening an office in Malta as the government markets itself as ""Blockchain Island"".""While Malta dominates when it comes to volumes, the United Kingdom is actually the location of the largest number of exchanges — although the UK accounts for just 1% of global trading volumes, Morgan Stanley notes.Morgan Stanley""Most are in the UK, Hong Kong and the US,"" Shah and her team note. ""The three countries have relatively large financial centres and the US has a technology focus in Silicon Valley.""There are six exchanges located in India but many are likely to have to shut down or relocate as this month the central bank ordered commercial banks to close accounts with exchanges.""Cryptocurrency exchanges have come under increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide as more and more money as flowed into the sector over the last year. While some countries such as India and the US have sought to crackdown on the activity, countries and territories such as Switzerland, Gibraltar, and Malta have sought to attract the nascent industry to their shores.""The blockchain and cryptocurrency industry is growing rapidly and can have economic benefits for a particular country through the creation of start-ups (good for jobs), research and development and financial transactions,"" Shah and team write. ""Governments are having to consider their regulatory stance quickly.""""Defined but also attractive regulation makes an exchange decide to choose one country over another – a set of laws for companies to follow when handling digital tokens, customer assets, AML policies, taxes, etc. Regulatory certainty is part of the attractiveness for the companies so they can plan for the future as they know what to expect.

So, understanding the company’s financial health becomes vital, since poor capital management may bring about bankruptcies, which occur at a higher rate for small-caps. Here are few basic financial health checks you should consider before taking the plunge. However, I know these factors are very high-level, so I recommend you dig deeper yourself into GICL here.GICL’s debt levels surged from ₹180.5M to ₹216.3M over the last 12 months , which comprises of short- and long-term debt. With this rise in debt, the current cash and short-term investment levels stands at ₹6.1M , ready to deploy into the business. Though its operating cash flow is not yet significant enough to calculate a meaningful cash-to-debt ratio, indicating that operational efficiency is something we’d need to take a look at. As the purpose of this article is a high-level overview, I won’t be looking at this today, but you can examine some of GICL’s operating efficiency ratios such as ROA here.Looking at GICL’s most recent ₹253.6M liabilities, the company has maintained a safe level of current assets to meet its obligations, with the current ratio last standing at 1.74x. For transportation companies, this ratio is within a sensible range as there’s enough of a cash buffer without holding too capital in low return investments.With total debt exceeding equities, GICL is considered a highly levered company. This is not unusual for small-caps as debt tends to be a cheaper and faster source of funding for some businesses. We can check to see whether GICL is able to meet its debt obligations by looking at the net interest coverage ratio. A company generating earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) at least three times its net interest payments is considered financially sound. In GICL’s, case, the ratio of 2.11x suggests that interest is not strongly covered, which means that lenders may be more reluctant to lend out more funding as GICL’s low interest coverage already puts the company at higher risk of default.Are you a shareholder? GICL’s cash flow coverage indicates it could improve its operating efficiency in order to meet demand for debt repayments should unforeseen events arise. However, its high liquidity ensures the company will continue to operate smoothly should unfavourable circumstances arise. Given that GICL’s financial situation may change. You should always be keeping on top of market expectations for GICL’s future growth on our free analysis platform.Are you a potential investor? With a high level of debt on its balance sheet, GICL could still be in a financially strong position if its cash flow also stacked up. However, this isn’t the case, and there’s room for GICL to increase its operational efficiency. Though, the company will be able to pay all of its upcoming liabilities from its current short-term assets. I encourage you to continue your research by taking a look at GICL’s past performance analysis on our free platform to figure out GICL’s financial health position. To help readers see pass the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data.

But once bills and the rent are paid, how do consumers spend their discretionary dollars? Consumers in North America are most likely to spend on technology, according to a new global survey from Acceleration Partners, a UK-based digital marketing agency. A disproportionate amount (34%) of North American respondents said tech-related purchases were their biggest sector spend. In contrast, Europeans and South Americans value fashion and beauty, with 31% and 17% of respondents, respectively, identifying the sector as the area they spend the most of their extra income.Asians prioritize food and drink, with 16% of respondents stating that they spend the majority of their discretionary income on wining and dining.Australians, on the other hand, prioritize travel, with 24% of respondents claiming they spend their leftover income on both domestic and international travel. Eighteen percent of African respondents said they spend most of their extra income on leisure pursuits.Overall, Asians felt the most flush with cash. Respondents, on average, said they have 27% of their income left after paying for all of life’s necessities. (This includes any potential savings, of course). North American consumers said that 14%, on average, of their income fell in the discretionary category.Australians have the least amount of extra money to spend, stating that they have a mere 6% of their income, on average, to use after covering all their expenses. Given the fact that Australia’s living costs are outpacing the rest of the world, it isn’t too much of a surprise that Australians feel like they have very limited resources to spend on things beyond the basics. 1,500 respondents from six continents (excluding Antarctica) participated in the online survey, all of whom were at least 21 years old and employed full-time.Melody Hahm is a senior writer at Yahoo Finance, covering entrepreneurship, technology and real estate.

There is no economic data to speak of ahead the opening bell; most of this good feeling comes from investors seeing value on the playing field after nearly two months of crashing index bottoms, as well as a news report (and accompanying presidential tweet) about a phone conversation between Presidents Trump and Xi indicating “big progress” in trade talks between the U.S. and China.There’s no replacing an actual trade deal signed by both sides, but we do not expect anything this concrete until closer to the end of the “cease fire” treaty between the two countries that push the extension of tariffs on trade goods to around March 1st of next year. Taking officials’ word for major developments tend to have a boomerang effect once those words prove light on the merits.Technically, 2018 was less volatile than 2015, which reportedly had more 1% intraday trading swings on the S&P 500 than 2018 did. You may recall 2015 as the year when oil prices continued their nasty dive begun the previous year, generating fears of a recessionary environment re-entering the market, with the cataclysm of 2008’s market crash still fresh in many investors’ minds.This year brought a huge corporate tax cut, which helped send markets soaring to all-time highs, only to be followed by interest rates ratcheting up by the Federal Reserve to sop up the threat of inflation entering the economy. Added to this was the sabre-rattling of a trade war turned into an active tariff battle between the top two economies in the world, for which many investors had not properly prepared during the historic run-ups in market values. As a result, we saw no fewer than five separate trading days that moved markets intra-day 4% or more in the past year.Even as the U.S. economy enjoys steady and robust employment levels — for which we’ll see new private-sector, non-farm payroll and Unemployment Rate numbers later this week (these reports are not expected to be affected by a partial government shutdown) — and healthy consumer confidence, as seen by recent holiday shopping figures, market indexes are seeing mounting question marks on the horizon for 2019. Slowing global growth, capped most recently by disappointing numbers in Chinese manufacturing, joins mounting tensions between the White House and the incoming Congress following November’s midterm election results as issues the market needs to grapple with.The Fed looks to have cooled its heels a bit on its rate-hike outlook for 2019; after four quarter-point raises added a full percentage point in the Fed funds rate in 2018, expectations have now dwindled for new quarter-point hikes — in some cases to zero through the next 12 months. Of course, Fed Chair Jay Powell and his associates will continue to be “data dependent” on any future interest rate decisions. Currently, we’re at a 2.25-2.50% range; previously, 3% was held as the preferred benchmark to help the Fed’s dual mandate of full employment and controlled inflation. Whether we get to 3% a year from now is most certainly in question.The worst performer on the Dow Jones index this year was Goldman Sachs GS, the high-end Wall Street investment staple.

But as markets swooned and executives of troubled companies dialed his number in 2008, Buffett also turned down many offers that might not have panned out so well, including with Lehman Brothers, AIG (AIG), and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with SQ. Click here to check it out. BAC 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BACPeter Lynch Chart of BACLehman Brothers Lehman Brothers Holdings' collapse occurred 10 years ago on Sept. 15. Then the fourth-largest bank in the U.S., it ranks as the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Most experts have concluded that the bank fell victim to too much leverage, not enough liquidity and heavy exposure to the subprime mortgage market.Buffett had at least three chances to come to the $639 billion bank's aid in 2008, according to a bankruptcy proceedings examiner's report. The first time, Lehman Brothers CEO Dick Fuld called Buffett on March 28 about a $2 billion investment. Buffett became wary of the deal when Fuld would not agree for Lehman executives to buy in on the same terms. Fuld also complained about short-sellers attacking his stock, which Buffett called ""a failure to admit to one's own problems.""Buffett then grew concerned with parts of the company's 10-K on March 28, such as ""real estate and high yield investments, lending-related commitments, derivatives and their related credit-market risk, Level III assets and Lehman's securitization activity."" Buffett officially decided against striking a deal after learning of a $100 million problem in Japan Fuld had not disclosed to him the next day, though Fuld was the one to end talks on March 31 when he found better offers for Lehman's April capital raise.Buffett again heard from Lehman in late August or early September as Lehman's problems intensified. Hugh McGee, Lehman Brother's head of investment banking, called David Sokol with a ""game plan"" and needing an investor. The strategy involved creating a ""bad bank"" called SpinCo with some of Lehman's mortgage assets and $24 billion from Lehman and outside investors. When Sokol briefed Buffett on the idea, Buffett said that it ""would not solve Lehman's problems.""The last time, McGee called Sokol a week before Lehman's bankruptcy with a ""Hail Mary"" pass.According to the files, ""McGee asked, 'Do you have any ideas to save us?' Sokol, who was bear hunting in Alaska at the time, told McGee that he did not.""American International Group (AIG)AIG, the American multinational finance and insurance corporation, was eventually rescued in a $182 bailout by the government, but first it called Buffett for help twice.The company's then-CEO Robert Willumstad asked Buffett in September 2008 to bid on some of its U.S. property-casualty operations. It took Buffett less than two hours on a Friday night to decide against participating.Turning down the offer ""wasn't very tough,"" Buffett said on Bloomberg. ""They needed more than we could supply by far. I didn't know the extent of it, but I knew that.""He added:""Sometimes you know it isn't going to happen,"" Buffett said. ""The time pressures, the degree of uncertainty, the depth of the possible hole, the need to get it through a regulatory body, it wasn't going to happen."" A second offer came two days later, but failed to go through due to a third party.Of the three Buffett refused, he would have had the best chance at profiting on AIG. Its share price ranged between $59 and $367 in September 2008 and returned to $59 by May 2015. Having never risen above $66 in the aftermath of the crisis, shares closed at $52.70 Friday, down 11% for the year.Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC)Once the largest shareholder in Freddie Mac, Buffett rejected the mortgage giants' call for help in 2008, he told CNBC. Similar to the case of AIG, his primary reason was the size of their problem.""And they were told to look for money and--but even the amount of money they were told to look for would be inadequate,"" he said in the August 2008 interview. ""I mean, $5 1/2 billion at Freddie would be, you know, that'd be like taking a spoonful out of the Atlantic to try and save the Titanic.""But as the two reported billions in net losses, Buffett had additional reasons for not investing.""So that doesn't mean that the equity can't get wiped out, and it almost has in the stock market, and in practical sense as institutions, they don't have any net worth,"" he said. ""I mean, if you look at their obligations and look at the fact they have big deferred tax assets as assets. They would've been gone in any market where the government wasn't behind them long, long ago.""See Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s portfolio here.

""Lehman always had a great group of people who enjoyed working together.""Vanessa Jagenburg, who was one of Lehman's few female managing directors in equities, recalled earning the nickname Vanna when she first joined Lehman in 1989, after ""Wheel of Fortune"" host Vanna White. She thinks a trader based on the West Coast bestowed the nickname because he thought she looked like the TV star, even though she was not blonde.""It was the greatest ride of my life,"" said Jagenburg, who was trading memories with former colleague Ron Gold, who worked in sales.Reuters spoke to more than a dozen people at the two soirees, where Stella Artois beer and vodka sodas flowed freely and some attendees scarfed down hamburgers while getting updates on former colleagues' lives. Most were dressed in business attire and said they have remained in finance, though their careers have gone in directions they would not have predicted before 2008.Matt Lewis worked in subprime mortgages at Lehman, pitching securitizations to clients who originated loans. He now uses his skills at a boutique firm, but because the mortgage market has changed dramatically since the crisis, much of Lewis' business has dried up.""It's like having worked on an assembly line at Ford,"" said Lewis. ""But they didn't just move the plant or close the line down. Now everyone's driving a hovercraft.""After seeing many of his 26,000 Lehman colleagues lose their jobs, Darren Kimball bought an outplacement services firm, now called GetFive.""I had a great first career,"" said Kimball who worked in equity research sales and trading at Lehman. ""But I don't miss being a slave to a stock going up or down on a Tuesday.""(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli and Josh Franklin in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

The intention was to make the index a more representative sample of the option market’s prediction of future volatility.In 2004, the CBOE introduced futures contracts on the VIX.  Because no physical commodity or instrument can be exchanged, VIX futures are cash settled, with the two counter-parties to a trade exchanging the cash value of the difference between the traded price and the settlement price of the index at expiration.  In 2006, the CBOE first listed options on the VIX.  Like the VIX futures, the options are cash settled with the difference between the settlement price and the strike price of in the money options exchanged.  Other than the fact that they are cash-settled and are European exercise (they cannot be exercised prior to expiration - which is a basically inconsequential detail to most individual investors) they trade just like options on individual stocks. Several ETFs have subsequently been introduced that allow traders to gain long or short exposure to the VIX, including some that are double or triple leveraged.For reference, the highest value ever recorded in the VIX intraday is 89.53% and the highest close is 80.86%, both occurring during the financial crisis of 2008.  The all-time intraday low is 8.56%, and the lowest close ever is 9.14%, both occurring in late 2017.The long-term average price of the VIX is slightly less than 19.9%. The average over the past few years has been closer to 12%, but with a few huge spikes.Although it is commonly referred to as the market’s “fear gauge”, high VIX values could actually mean an expectation of a large move in either direction, but because of the well-documented belief that markets fall faster in bad times than they rise in good times, the VIX tends to increase most in times of market panic when stock prices are moving down.VIX Futures PricesThe VIX futures are almost always higher than the cash VIX value in a price relationship known as contango.  As the expiration of a futures contract nears, the price of the futures steadily converges with the cash (or “spot”) price of the index.  At expiration, the settlement price used is the cash price.In quiet and steadily rising markets - like we saw between 2016 and February of 2018 - this contango relationship creates an opportunity to make easy profits selling VIX futures.  Because observed volatility was very low during this period and the VIX mostly stayed in the low teens, traders could make money by selling VIX futures and simply waiting for them to converge with the (lower) cash VIX price.  In many cases, instead of selling the actual futures, traders purchased the XIV, an ETF that replicated a short position in near term futures - except with 2X leverage.There are several factors that contributed to the extremely low volatility experienced during this period, but it is widely agreed that a major factor was the growing propensity of individual investors to eschew actively managed funds and instead pour their money into broad-based index funds.  Consistent inflows into a diverse basket of stocks tends to dampen the price volatility of the basket.Look Out for the SteamrollerWith the benefit of hindsight, we can see how this trade ultimately turned out.  Selling VIX futures turned out to be what is commonly known in the industry as “picking up nickels in front of a steamroller,” meaning taking a succession of small profits, while ignoring the probability of an out-sized loss that wipes out all of the accumulated profits and potentially much more.Why would a trader take risks that eclipsed the potential rewards?  There are two main reasons.  One is that the trader is ignorant of the risk - or at least vastly underestimates it.  The other possible reason is that the trader does understand the risk, but because of a contractual arrangement with either investors (in the case of a hedge fund manager) or the trader’s employer (in the case of a firm proprietary trader) it is in the trader’s immediate best interest to book easy profits while taking outsized risk - because he will be paid a portion of the profits if the trade works, but is not made to personally bear a share of the losses if it doesn’t.  Hint: In the long run, it’s profitable to be on the other side of the trades of either of those traders.In an August 2017 article on the growing popularity of leveraged VIX and inverse VIX ETF products despite the risks, the New York Times profiled a trader who had quit his job as a manager at a Target store to sell the VIX full time.  He claimed to have started with $500K and grew the account to $12 million over the preceding few years.  When the Times interviewed that trader again, one day after the VIX experienced its biggest single-day spike ever (on February 5th, the same day Goldman Sachs took in that $200M haul), he admitted to feeling pain in the trade, but said he was still betting 21% of his portfolio – or $600,000 – in continuing to sell the VIX.  If 21% of his portfolio was then worth $600K, some quick math would suggest that he had already lost $9 million - a 75% drawdown.The double short XIV ETF was closed down completely in February by the issuer after losing over 80% of its value in a short period of time. Many traders who were short the VIX faced margin calls and had to either post additional capital to maintain their accounts, or have their trades liquidated at steep losses.Online broker Charles Schwab (SCHW) reported a $15M non-recurring charge in the first quarter of 2018 to cover the negative account values of customers who were selling VIX products and suffered losses in excess of funds on deposit.Profit and ProtectionEven if you buy the premise that selling VIX instruments for short term profits is ultimately a losing trade, doing the opposite can be painful in a different way. Investors who own VIX futures or ETFs tend to suffer constant losses for months or even years before experiencing an increased volatility event that makes the trade profitable.Admittedly, this can be an emotionally difficult way to trade.When considered as a hedge against a diversified portfolio of equities however, owning calls on the VIX starts to look like a wise decision.  Though they are likely to decline in value during steadily rising markets, those options will rise significantly in value at exactly the times during which the broad markets are experiencing the most difficulty.Goldman Sachs had the prescience and discipline to stay long fairly inexpensive VIX instruments in order to be able to sell them out at hugely profitable prices when the rest of the market needed them most.In the end, the decision come down to a simple question.  Do you want to be positioned like Goldman - one of the most sophisticated and successful firms on the street, or do you want to be positioned like a short-sighted day trader who will soon be looking for a new day job?Owning VIX calls is a fairly simple way for an individual investor to protect gains in the equity markets, knowing that the long term odds of success are on your side.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Maybe you are shopping around to make sure you get the best yield on savings.Analyses and rankings — such as you’ll find in articles like “The Best Banks for Your Money” — are a great starting point. But what about customer satisfaction and other factors that aren’t easily quantified?For starters, ask around when researching financial institutions, as we explain in “10 Tips for Finding a Bank With More Bang for Your Buck.”Another resource is the Consumer Complaint Database maintained by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).The federal agency publishes complaints about financial products and services to this public database after giving the complained-about companies a chance to respond.Attempting to wade through the database on your own can be intimidating. It contains hundreds of thousands of complaints and can be searched in various ways. A recent LendEDU analysis of the database enables you to quickly tell which banks garnered the most complaints in 2017, however.The analysis covered more than 200,000 complaints about all types of financial products received by the CFPB between Jan. 1 and Dec. 10 last year.Based on that, LendEDU found that the 10 institutions that drew the most complaints last year were:Wells Fargo & Co. : 8,465 complaintsBank of America Corp. : 8,069JPMorgan Chase & Co. (includes Chase Bank): 7,747Citigroup Inc. (includes Citibank): 6,600U.S. Bancorp (includes U.S. Bank): 2,338PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (includes PNC Bank): 1,374SunTrust Banks Inc. : 1,159Citizens Financial Group Inc. (includes Citizens Bank): 782Fifth Third Bancorp (includes Fifth Third Bank): 698BB&T Corp. : 680Watch the video of ‘The 10 Most Hated Banks of the Past Year’ on MoneyTalksNews.com.While the CFPB’s Consumer Complaint Database can be a useful resource for comparison shoppers, you shouldn’t put too much weight on these complaints. By its own admission, the CFPB doesn’t verify all claims made in complaints.I’ve walked away from a couple of banks on that list, but it wasn’t over customer service or anything else that merited complaining to the CFPB. I simply wanted more for my money — as in higher interest rates.Generally, you’ll find better rates — among other account benefits — at online-only banks, or possibly a credit union. Both types of institutions tend to have lower overhead costs than traditional banks. And neither type of institution appears on the list above.I found the best interest rates for my savings and checking account at an online bank. It even had lower fees to boot.For help finding a higher-yielding savings or checking account or certificate of deposit, try out Money Talks News’ account comparison tool.Then, if you find a bank worth switching to, check out “5 Simple Steps to Painlessly Switch Banks.”So, what’s your take on the most complained-about banks of 2017?

The word -- coined by best-selling author and trader Nassim Taleb -- refers to things that can actually benefit from chaos over the long-run, instead of remaining the same (robust) or outright breaking (fragile).That's because if and when an economic downturn hits, lots of cash, manageable debt, and strong free cash flows can be used to: (1) buy back a company's shares at a discount, (2) acquire up and coming rivals at low valuations, and (3) bleed out the competition by offering lower pricing in an effort to gain long-term market share.CompanyCashDebtFree Cash FlowBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) (NYSE: BRK-A)$205 billion$102 billion$33 billionApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)$269 billion$97 billion$51 billionAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)$108 billion$4 billion$24 billionMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)$144 billion$76 billion$32 billionTencent (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY)$62 billion$18 billion$14 billionData source: Yahoo! Finance, Tencent IR, Berkshire Hathaway IR. Cash includes short- and long-term investments. All figures rounded to the nearest billion USD.Several companies around the world have strong balance sheets, but only a select few make this list. It is a club of uber-cash-rich organizations so strong any one could act as its own bank, getting deals with very favorable terms from distressed companies, akin to what Warren Buffett did with GE and Goldman Sachs in 2008.Two of this club's members also devote a significant portion of their cash to investing in other publicly traded companies. By identifying great investment opportunities and buying in at favorable prices, this can create enormous value for shareholders.Berkshire is a prime example of this phenomenon. Consider that by owning shares of the company, you are also investing in an organization that owns:9% of Wells Fargo27% of Kraft Heinz3% of fellow balance-sheet-stalwart Apple7% of Bank of America, and9% of Coca-ColaThough Tencent's balance sheet is the least impressive of the group, this approach to asset allocation is a big reason why I included it on the list. The Chinese parent company of the the world's largest gaming outfit and the most popular mobile app -- WeChat -- Tencent has also spread the wealth around with its own investments.The company has a 5% stake in Tesla, a 12% position in Snap, and a 5% stake in Activision Blizzard. Beyond that, according to Bloomberg, Tencent has invested in 19 Chinese ""unicorns"" -- start-ups that are now valued at over $1 billion. That's the most of any firm in the region.Image source: Getty ImagesThe situation is a bit different with Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft, none of which holds splashy positions in publicly traded companies.Alphabet changed its name from Google a few years back to highlight the other ""bets"" that it was taking. These bets include self-driving cars (Waymo), connected devices in the home (Nest), healthcare (Verily), longevity (Calico), and many smaller moonshots (Google[x]). While many of these ventures will probably fail, all it takes is one of them succeeding to significantly move the needle for investors.Microsoft, on the other hand, has used its war chest to make a number of pricey acquisitions -- some which have earned investors' ire (aQuantive) while others have yet to play out (LinkedIn). In the meantime, investors can take heart in knowing that the 1.9% dividend yield offered up is very safe: over the last twelve months, it ate up just 38% of free cash flow.And Apple has famously decided to return its cash from abroad and pay a huge one-time tax bill thanks to the GOP's tax overhaul in late 2017. The company will be paying $38 billion to Uncle Sam, and investing heavily in the United States. It will also be spending $30 billion on capital expenditures stateside over the next five years, $5 billion on an Advanced Manufacturing Fund, and $55 billion on purchases from domestic suppliers and manufacturers.All told, by holding shares in any or all of these five companies, you have impressive downside protection in times of crisis, and the ability to see your companies grow stronger during such times.That's important to remember, because when such times hit, almost all stocks will suffer -- including these five. But the competitive advantages of the underlying companies gives them an outsized chance of getting even stronger. That's why this advantage can only be realized by investors with a long-term mindset. Invest accordingly!

Among them: J.P. Morgan ($2 billion), Citibank ($4 billion), Bank of America ($5 billion), Morgan Stanley ($2.6 billion), Goldman Sachs ($2.385 billion), Deutsche Bank ($3.1 billion); Credit Suisse ($2.48 billion) and Barclays ($2 billion).Last week, DOJ sued UBS, seeking unspecified damages for allegedly defrauding investors in connection with the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities more than a decade ago.“UBS knowingly and intentionally misrepresented key characteristics of the loans it securitized in the subject deals in order to conceal the fact that these loans were much riskier and much more likely to default than UBS represented to investors,” states the 208-page complaint filed in the Eastern District of New York.In part, DOJ is relying on FIRREA because it’s got a 10-year statute of limitations. But Giuffra argues the statute was never intended to be used the way the government is wielding it now—“as a thermonuclear securities law,” he said in an interview from Switzerland. It’s not that UBS hasn’t settled any RMBS government cases. The Swiss banking giant paid $885 million in 2013 to the Federal Housing Finance Agency for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-related claims.But it’s notable that the company got a pass from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which declined to take any action against UBS, even as it slammed other financial institutionsUBS argues it’s different. For one thing, as the company noted in a press release, it invested $100 billion in U.S. residential mortgage-related assets but lost more than $45 billion when the housing market collapsed. The complaint focuses on 40 specific deals—but UBS says it was the biggest loser in those transactions, taking a $900 million hit. “This fact alone negates any inference that UBS engaged in an intentional fraud that was flatly against its own economic interest,” the company said.Moreover, UBS “originated only a miniscule proportion of U.S. residential mortgages between 2005 and 2007,” the bank said, and didn’t originate any subprime loans. That meant it was not as well-positioned to know about the underlying quality (or lack thereof) of the mortgages compared to some rivals. (Bank of America/ Countrywide/ Franklin Financial, for example, originated almost $2 trillion in mortgages from 2005 to 2007, compared to $1.5 billion for UBS.)However, DOJ points to damning internal UBS communications that suggest the bank was well aware that the underlying mortgages did not comply with representations made to investors. One UBS trader, for example, called some loans “quite possibly better than little beside leprosy spores,” according to the complaint. Another called a pool of loans “a bag of sh*t.” And another a 2006 instant message conversation said “our crack due diligence effort is a joke.”Still, Giuffra has an excellent track record defending UBS. In 2014, The American Lawyer named him a Litigator of the Year for defeating a massive securities class action against the bank.“Sometimes it pays to settle—and sometimes it pays to fight,” he said. This time, UBS “is committed to litigate.”Another RMBS case came to a close last week, when a team of litigators from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan led by William Price, Peter Calamari and Isaac Nesser scored a $28.7 million verdict on behalf of Residential Funding Company (now ResCap Liquidating Trust).On Nov. 8, a federal jury in Minnesota socked Home Loan Center Inc., which is represented by Williams & Connolly, with the penalty after a 16-day trial. With attorneys’ fees and interest, the payout could be more like $60 million. I wrote about the case on the eve of trial. Quinn client RFC was a middleman that would buy loans from mortgage lenders, package them and resell them as securities to investors. Turns out, many of the underlying loans were garbage. RFC got hammered by the banks it sold the loans to, and is now going after the mortgage lenders that sold it the loans in the first place.RFC argued that under the terms of their contracts, the originating lenders agreed to assume liability for any misrepresentations for breaches, regardless of their knowledge or RFC’s knowledge.In part, the Quinn team’s success hinged on convincing U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson to eliminate many of Home Loan’s expert and fact witnesses. To date, Quinn lawyers have won 80 settlements for RFC, recouping $1.2 billion. Two more trials, against Standard Pacific and UAMC, are scheduled for January.

This year, we have executives, developers and innovators from the likes of Facebook, Amazon, IBM, JP Morgan, Zelle, TD Ameritrade, TradeStation, Fidelity, and so many more.The BZ Awards is an oscar-like event to showcase those companies creating technology that is paving the way for the future of financial services and capital markets. In preparation for its biggest installment yet this May, we're profiling the companies that have moved to the final round of judging for the BZ Awards. In this feature we focus in on Capital Market Laboratories.What does your company do? What unique problem does it solve? We break the information asymmetry that has benefited the top 0.1 percent of investors and the mega institutions at the expense of the rest for far too long. yes they know more than retail knows. Yes they use it to profit. Yes, we are breaking it.Capital Market Laboratories is a member of Thomson First Call Institutional research. While our research sits side-by-side with Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan. Morgan Stanley, and the rest, we are the anti-institution and make our research and tools available to everyone. While others are paying $2000/mo for their terminals and another large fee for add-ons, we make our institutional tools available to retail investors.Who are your customers? Mostly retail traders, some of whom used to be professionals and have moved on. We do have some institutional users as well.How long have you been in business?4 yearsWhere are you located?Los Angeles, CAWho is your company's leadership? What kind of experience do they have? None of this is possible without a team that has an institutional background, peer reviewed machine earning and finance papers, and massive reach into the guts of finance and its history. Here are our three key members (of course the team is larger). This is worth the read:Ophir Gottlieb (CEO & Co-founder) — Ophir Gottlieb is the CEO & Co-founder of Capital Market Laboratories. He contributes to Yahoo! Finance, CNNMoney,MarketWatch, Business Insider, and Reuters. He was rated the 14th best finance follow on all of Twitter.He has turned away from institutional finance and re-dedicated his life to helping all people find the capacity and facility to invest with the same confidence and information available to only the top 0.1 percent. In many ways, Ophir was unintentionally a part of this asymmetry, but now, he is here to tear it down.Ophir Gottlieb is inventor of the Forensic Alpha Model (FAM) and a co-inventor of Accounting and Governance Risk Model (AGR), both now owned commercially by MSCI. SSRN lists his peer reviewed research published in the Rotman International Journal of Finance, and as far as we can tell, he was one of the earliest scientists to identify deep learning, and in particular, neural networks, as a novel approach to examining financial markets while also whole hardheartedly incorporating corporate governance.Mr. Gottlieb’s methodological approach taken in creating FAM was endorsed by the head of artificial intelligence for the state of Germany as a novel and extraordinary application of advanced machine learning and quantitative finance.FAM and AGR are used by asset managers worldwide with over $1 trillion of assets under management. The FAM model has made Mr. Gottlieb one of the most recognized names in all of quantitative finance.The Huffington Post dedicated an article to Ophir’s views in the dossier Financial Services Third Wave of Innovation: AI & Machine Learning. A rare view into his vision of the world of finance, including a 20 minute video session.Mr Gottlieb’s mathematics, measure theory and machine learning background stems from his graduate work in mathematics and measure theory at Stanford University and his time as an option market maker on the NYSE and CBOE exchange floors. He has been cited by various financial media over 500 times including Reuters, Bloomberg, Wall St. Journal, Dow Jones Newswire and through re-publications in Barron’s, Forbes, SF Chronicle, Chicago Tribune and Miami Herald. Now he is often seen on financial television around the world.Mr. Gottlieb was an option maker on the NYSE ARCA exchange floor and simultaneously on the Chicago Board Option Exchange (CBOE) remotely. He first gained notoriety as the managing director of client services and algorithmic trading for Livevol Inc, recently acquired by CBOE. He created and authored what was believed to be the most widely followed option trading blog in the world for three-years that was consumed as real-time news on Bloomberg terminals.James A. Kaplan (Chairman & Co-founder) — Mr. Kaplan is a founding director of MarketWatch, and is widely recognized as one of the grandfather’s of modern portfolio theory.For the past 20 years, James Kaplan’s research interests and entrepreneurial ventures have focused on innovations designed to improve the predictive and explanatory power of classical finance theories and portfolio management philosophies. Before he co-founded CML, Mr. Kaplan as Vice Chairman and Chief Executive of GMI Ratings (now part of MSCI). In this role, Mr. Kaplan developed novel risk modeling methodologies to help capital market participants mitigate the impact of what he has dubbed “routine anomalies”. The term refers to high-impact events stemming from variables typically overlooked in classical economic theories.Earlier in his career, Mr. Kaplan has advanced groundbreaking applications of quantitative techniques and technology-driven solutions for equity and fixed-income portfolio analytics. In 1979, he founded Capital Management Sciences (CMS) and established the firm as the world’s top purveyor of fixed income portfolio analytics. During his tenure, the firm introduced CMS BondEdge, the chief independent source of research and valuation tools for the global bond market.Following the sale of CMS to Interactive Data Corporation, Mr. Kaplan was a founding director of MarketWatch. In the wake of the notorious corporate scandals after 2000, he founded Audit Integrity, one of the three firms that merged to form GMI Ratings. Mr. Kaplan received his BA from the University of Colorado and an MBA from California State University. Mr. Kaplan is a Chartered Financial Analyst.Jason Hitchings (Chief Technology Officer) – Jason Hitchings is the Chief Technology Officer at CML. He has diverse background in software engineering, product development, data visualizations as well as numerical analysis and real-time algorithmic option pricing.He was the lead developer and product manager that led to one of the first ever SQL databases that updated asset prices in real-time; an accomplishment at the time that was considered by many in the industry to be impossible but is now commonplace in all of the exchanges and major banks in the world.Jason’s experience includes Head of Product at data visualization firm, Quid, the co-founder and lead engineer of financial analytics firm and broker-dealer, Livevol, Inc. Jason has also worked as the lead software engineer on Lockheed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter Autonomic Logistics team.Jason holds a computer science degree from University of Colorado, Boulder.Who are your investors, if any?James A.

Exchanges are the venues on which cryptocurrencies trade and the biggest can see daily trading volumes in the billions.The investment bank's research shows that the majority of volumes flow, at least nominally, through Malta. This is largely down to Binance, one of the biggest exchanges in the world, recently announcing plans to shift its legal headquarters to the small European island.""The largest exchange called Binance announced intentions to set up headquarters there, so if we take that company out, Malta would be much further down the list,"" Shah and her team wrote.""Binance said that it was moving away from Asia (currently registered in Hong Kong) due to more stringent regulation, especially from Japan. The third-largest exchange, OKEx, also recently announced that it was opening an office in Malta as the government markets itself as ""Blockchain Island"".""While Malta dominates when it comes to volumes, the United Kingdom is actually the location of the largest number of exchanges — although the UK accounts for just 1% of global trading volumes, Morgan Stanley notes.Morgan Stanley""Most are in the UK, Hong Kong and the US,"" Shah and her team note. ""The three countries have relatively large financial centres and the US has a technology focus in Silicon Valley.""There are six exchanges located in India but many are likely to have to shut down or relocate as this month the central bank ordered commercial banks to close accounts with exchanges.""Cryptocurrency exchanges have come under increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide as more and more money as flowed into the sector over the last year. While some countries such as India and the US have sought to crackdown on the activity, countries and territories such as Switzerland, Gibraltar, and Malta have sought to attract the nascent industry to their shores.""The blockchain and cryptocurrency industry is growing rapidly and can have economic benefits for a particular country through the creation of start-ups (good for jobs), research and development and financial transactions,"" Shah and team write. ""Governments are having to consider their regulatory stance quickly.""""Defined but also attractive regulation makes an exchange decide to choose one country over another – a set of laws for companies to follow when handling digital tokens, customer assets, AML policies, taxes, etc. Regulatory certainty is part of the attractiveness for the companies so they can plan for the future as they know what to expect.

Though the sector is teeming with bullish setups, Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is flashing one of the best ones. And that makes HAL stock a top pick for today.Source: Jason Sussberg via FlickrSince bottoming last August near $38, Halliburton shares have been on a rocket ship to the moon. The fun began in earnest in mid-December when the Texas-based oil services company finally felled overhead resistance.Indeed, once the 200-day moving average gave way, HAL’s launch went vertical.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat’s perhaps most impressive is even though the stock had already rallied from $38 to $53 ahead of last week’s earnings announcement, it still screamed higher after the event on heavy volume to boot. Spectators disappointed at missing out on its ascent can take heart. The stock just formed a picture-perfect six-day pullback to its rising 20-day moving average. Support also looms large in the form of old resistance and a gap fill area at $53. 7 Stocks to Buy That Are Winning With Tech Yesterday’s trading session formed a long lower wick suggesting that buyers are already emerging to gobble up this dip.Source: OptionsAnalytixWith crude prices still in a strong uptrend, and the energy sector still in bullish territory this dip must be viewed as a buying opportunity.Though quarterly earnings has come and gone, the implied volatility for HAL stock options remains pumped. And that means short premium strategies are still paying big rewards. If you’re willing to wager HAL sits above $50 at March expiration then sell the March $50/$45 bull put spread for 55 cents. The vertical spread consists of selling to open the $50 put and buying to open the $45 put.The initial 55-cent premium represents the max reward and will be captured if the puts expire out-of-the-money. The max risk is $4.45, but you can minimize the damage by exiting if HAL breaks the 50-day moving average at $48.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn’t hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

As a result, oil-related stocks have also benefited. For example Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) came into its earnings up 15% since then and that was on top of another 10% from two weeks prior. This morning, bulls are adding an additional 2% on earnings headlines and this worries me a bit and therein lies my opportunity today.I want to short the near-term price action in HAL stock.Before you label me a perma-bear, this is not a knock against the company or its prospects. This is a bet that prices have run up too far in a short period of time. In fact, I will use HAL’s own support to hedge my bet. I wouldn’t do that if I thought that the company is headed for a collapse.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsContrary to popular belief, OPEC still is relevant to energy prices, especially oil. Rhetoric under the new Saudi Arabia regime has changed. No longer do we see a commitment to keeping prices depressed so they can recapture market share. This is a double-edged sword. As prices rise, so will global non-OPEC production.While this could be good for HAL, it could also bring about a correction in energy prices. A sharp dip from this altitude would certainly have a significant effect on already stretched energy-related stocks. 6 of the Strangest ETFs You Can Buy Fundamentally, HAL is not cheap. Its traditional price-to-earnings ratio is over 200 and the company operates with red net margins. Luckily, price-to-book is a reasonable 4.9 so although there is no comparative value, there is some overall value.Technically, when a stock rallies as fast as HAL stock has, it leaves it vulnerable to a break in the rising wedge. This is the potential I want to capture. But since I have no major beef with the company fundamentals, I will hedge my bet by cutting my out-of-pocket expense.There are opportunities for more technical momentum, especially above $58-per-share, but it was last January when it rallied to these levels before correcting 30% from there. I am not forecasting the same outcome this time around, but I do anticipate that from here, the path higher won’t be as easy as last month.The bottom line is that I believe that here we have the opposite situation to a falling knife. I call them shooting stars, and some are easy to short without any out of pocket risk. HAL has run too fast too far and I want to try and profit from it. 3 Tech Trades to Bet on 'FANG' Stocks in 2018 The Bearish Trade: Buy the HAL Mar $52.50/$50 debit put spread for 50-cents-per-contract. Here, I need the price to fall through my spread for a chance to more than triple my money.But since I am not bearish on the fundamentals, I will eliminate my out of pocket expense by using recent support in HAL stock.The Bank — Optional: Sell the HAL Jun $45 naked put and collect 70 cents to open. This is a bullish trade, which has a 90% theoretical chance of winning.Taking both trades would result in a net credit. So as long a Halliburton stock stays above my April sold puts, then any premium I recapture from selling my bearish put spread would be pure profit.Ultimately, investing in stocks is fraught with danger, so I never risk more than I am willing to lose.Get my newsletter for free here.

The company had more than 5,000 employees as of Dec. 31.Excluding certain items, Hasbro earned $1.93 per share, missing expectation of $2.23, according to Refinitiv estimates.Revenue also fell short of expectations.Hasbro shares were down nearly 5 percent at $93.41 in late-morning trade, while those of Mattel were down 2 percent.(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

It didn’t help that lots of other toys were hitting around the same time, he said, “with an array of entertainment initiatives coming to market.”With “The Last Jedi” rollout, Hasbro and Walt Disney Co. had hoped to duplicate the success of 2015’s “The Force Awakens.” In both cases, they debuted toys in September — about three months before the movie reached theaters.But when “The Force Awakens” came out, there was pent-up demand for all things Star Wars. It was the first film in a new trilogy, and fans lined up at midnight to snag action figures and lightsabers.That strategy backfired in 2017 for “The Last Jedi,” the eighth episode in the saga. Hardcore fans still came out in September, but the momentum quickly faded. Sales of Star Wars toys unexpectedly declined last year.Hasbro’s overall revenue fell 2 percent in the fourth quarter, and its shares have lost 7.8 percent of their value this year.Hasbro isn’t the only company that had a tough holiday season. Mattel Inc. saw sales plummet 12 percent in the fourth quarter — with girls’ toys, other than Barbie, performing especially badly.The Star Wars slump has fed the idea that consumers are suffering from broader franchise fatigue, brought on by too many movie sequels, spinoffs and reboots. There were more than 20 such movies last year, and more planned for 2018. But Hasbro says good storytelling — like Marvel’s “Black Panther” — still can draw huge audiences.Hasbro has another chance to reignite Star Wars buzz in the coming weeks. Merchandise for “Solo: A Star Wars Story” will roll out in early April.

Henry Schein’s insiders have divested from 15.18k shares in the large-cap stock within the past three months. It is widely considered that insider selling stock in their own companies is potentially a bearish signal. A two-decade research published in The MIT Press (1998) showed that stocks following insider selling declined 2.7% relative to the market. However, it may not be sufficient to base your investment decision merely on these signals. I’ve analysed two possible reasons driving the insiders’ decision to reduce their investment of late.  See our latest analysis for Henry Schein  Over the past three months, more shares have been sold than bought by Henry Schein’s insiders. In total, individual insiders own over 2.14 million shares in the business, which makes up around 1.4% of total shares outstanding. Insiders that have recently trimmed down their holdings are Mark Mlotek and Paul Brons (board member) .At first glance, analysts’ earnings expectations of 88.3% over the next three years illustrates a very buoyant outlook for the business. However, this is inconsistent with the signal company insiders are sending with their net selling activity. Delving deeper into the line items, Henry Schein is expected to experience a limited level of revenue growth next year, but a suggestively greater level of expected earnings growth. Usually this discrepancy can be explained by an equally significant drop in costs. This may not be seen as a maintainable practice by insiders, who may expect a deterioration in earnings to reflect lower revenues growth in the future. Or they may merely view the stock as overvalued by the market which provides a suitable time to sell.Alternatively, the timing of these insider transactions may have been driven by share price volatility. A correlation could mean directors are trading on market inefficiencies based on their belief of the company’s intrinsic value. Within the past three months, Henry Schein’s share price traded at a high of $82.17 and a low of $69.2. This indicates moderate volatility with a share price movement of 18.74%. Perhaps not a significant enough movement to warrant transactions, thus motivation may be a result of their belief in the company in the future or simply personal needs.Henry Schein’s net selling activity tells us the stock has fallen out of favour with some insiders as of late, however, this is rather cautious relative to analysts’ earnings expectation, and the relatively stable stock price may not warrant exploiting any mispricing. But we must also be aware that insiders divesting may not actually be based their views on the company’s outlook. Moreover, while insider selling can be a useful prompt, following the lead of an insider, however, will never replace diligent research.

Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership.Hewlett Packard Enterprise is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of US$24.53b. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. In the chart below below, we can see that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let’s delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about HPE.  View our latest analysis for Hewlett Packard Enterprise  Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Hewlett Packard Enterprise does have institutional investors; and they hold 83.3% of the stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It’s therefore worth looking at Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s earnings history, below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don’t have a many shares in Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.The definition of company insiders can be subjective, and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amount to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$36.0m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. With a 16.6% ownership, the general public have some degree of sway over HPE. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Read on to find out.These stocks can help you add some more green to your portfolio. But which is the best buy now? Image source: Getty Images.Sherwin-Williams is the market leader in the $125 billion paint and coatings industry. Unlike many of its competitors, the company's vast network of retail stores allows it to cut out the middleman and interact directly with its customers. This gives it an informational advantage, helping it to innovate and adapt to changing consumer trends faster than its rivals. Moreover, its strong brand gives it pricing power, or the ability to consistently raise prices without severely impacting sales. Together, that's helped Sherwin-Williams deliver nearly five times the gains of the S&P 500 over the past decade.Sherwin-Williams Stock Performance, data by YCharts.Like Sherwin-Williams, Home Depot is a dominant force within its industry. Its more than $100 billion in annual revenue dwarfs that of No. 2 home-improvement retailer Lowe's, which checks in at less than $70 billion. This size and scale help Home Depot earn industry-leading returns on capital and generate strong free cash flow, which it passes on to shareholders in the form of a rising dividend and sizable share repurchases.Home Depot Stock Highlights, data by YCharts.All told, both Sherwin-Williams and Home Depot are strong, competitively advantaged businesses. Of the two, though, I believe Home Depot -- as a retailer -- is more exposed to the threat posed by e-commerce juggernaut Amazon.com. Sherwin-Williams, which also manufactures its products, is more insulated from this risk. Home Depot has done an admirable job of defending its market share up to this point, and the company has solid plans in place to further fortify its defenses against online competitors. However, I'm going to give the edge to Sherwin-Williams for its more defensible economic moat.Advantage: Sherwin-WilliamsLet's now see how Home Depot and Sherwin-Williams compare on some important financial metrics.MetricHome DepotSherwin-WilliamsRevenue$101.96 billion$16.19 billionOperating income$14.71 billion$1.86 billionNet income$9.02 billion$1.78 billionOperating cash flow$11.45 billion$1.69 billionFree cash flow$9.45 billion$1.47 billionCash$3.60 billion$0.16 billionDebt$25.79 billion$10.81 billionData sources: Morningstar, Company Filings.It's easy to see that Home Depot is the far larger and more financially powerful business, with nearly $3.5 billion more in cash reserves, five times the net profit, and six times the free cash flow of Sherwin-Williams.Advantage: Home DepotThanks largely to its acquisition of Valspar, Sherwin-Williams is projected to increase its revenue by 18% in 2018 and nearly 6% in 2019. Home Depot, meanwhile, is expected to grow its sales by about 7% this year and 4% next year.As for earnings per share, Wall Street is forecasting that Sherwin-Williams' EPS will rise at a 15% annualized clip over the next five-years, as the company realizes more of the benefits of its Valspar acquisition. Home Depot is also projected to increase its earnings about 15% annually during this period, fueled by its ""One Home Depot"" strategy and additional share repurchases.Still, due to its greater expected revenue growth, I'll give the edge to Sherwin-Williams here.Advantage: Sherwin-WilliamsFinally, let's take a look at some valuation metrics for these two retailers.MetricHome DepotSherwin-WilliamsP/S2.212.53P/FCF23.8225.80Trailing P/E25.3321.83Forward P/E19.2018.59PEG1.361.40Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Home Depot's shares are less expensive on a price-to-sales and price-to-free cash flow basis, while Sherwin-Williams shares are cheaper on both a trailing and forward price-to-earnings basis. And these two stocks' PEG ratios are essentially the same, which makes sense since they're expected to grow their EPS at basically the same rate over the next half-decade. So, I'm going to call it a draw in terms of valuation.Advantage: Neither With these two home-improvement stocks trading at similar valuation levels, Sherwin-Williams' more defensible competitive position and greater revenue growth prospects make it the better buy today.

Read on to find out.These stocks can help you add some more green to your portfolio. But which is the best buy now? Image source: Getty Images.Sherwin-Williams is the market leader in the $125 billion paint and coatings industry. Unlike many of its competitors, the company's vast network of retail stores allows it to cut out the middleman and interact directly with its customers. This gives it an informational advantage, helping it to innovate and adapt to changing consumer trends faster than its rivals. Moreover, its strong brand gives it pricing power, or the ability to consistently raise prices without severely impacting sales. Together, that's helped Sherwin-Williams deliver nearly five times the gains of the S&P 500 over the past decade.Sherwin-Williams Stock Performance, data by YCharts.Like Sherwin-Williams, Home Depot is a dominant force within its industry. Its more than $100 billion in annual revenue dwarfs that of No. 2 home-improvement retailer Lowe's, which checks in at less than $70 billion. This size and scale help Home Depot earn industry-leading returns on capital and generate strong free cash flow, which it passes on to shareholders in the form of a rising dividend and sizable share repurchases.Home Depot Stock Highlights, data by YCharts.All told, both Sherwin-Williams and Home Depot are strong, competitively advantaged businesses. Of the two, though, I believe Home Depot -- as a retailer -- is more exposed to the threat posed by e-commerce juggernaut Amazon.com. Sherwin-Williams, which also manufactures its products, is more insulated from this risk. Home Depot has done an admirable job of defending its market share up to this point, and the company has solid plans in place to further fortify its defenses against online competitors. However, I'm going to give the edge to Sherwin-Williams for its more defensible economic moat.Advantage: Sherwin-WilliamsLet's now see how Home Depot and Sherwin-Williams compare on some important financial metrics.MetricHome DepotSherwin-WilliamsRevenue$101.96 billion$16.19 billionOperating income$14.71 billion$1.86 billionNet income$9.02 billion$1.78 billionOperating cash flow$11.45 billion$1.69 billionFree cash flow$9.45 billion$1.47 billionCash$3.60 billion$0.16 billionDebt$25.79 billion$10.81 billionData sources: Morningstar, Company Filings.It's easy to see that Home Depot is the far larger and more financially powerful business, with nearly $3.5 billion more in cash reserves, five times the net profit, and six times the free cash flow of Sherwin-Williams.Advantage: Home DepotThanks largely to its acquisition of Valspar, Sherwin-Williams is projected to increase its revenue by 18% in 2018 and nearly 6% in 2019. Home Depot, meanwhile, is expected to grow its sales by about 7% this year and 4% next year.As for earnings per share, Wall Street is forecasting that Sherwin-Williams' EPS will rise at a 15% annualized clip over the next five-years, as the company realizes more of the benefits of its Valspar acquisition. Home Depot is also projected to increase its earnings about 15% annually during this period, fueled by its ""One Home Depot"" strategy and additional share repurchases.Still, due to its greater expected revenue growth, I'll give the edge to Sherwin-Williams here.Advantage: Sherwin-WilliamsFinally, let's take a look at some valuation metrics for these two retailers.MetricHome DepotSherwin-WilliamsP/S2.212.53P/FCF23.8225.80Trailing P/E25.3321.83Forward P/E19.2018.59PEG1.361.40Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Home Depot's shares are less expensive on a price-to-sales and price-to-free cash flow basis, while Sherwin-Williams shares are cheaper on both a trailing and forward price-to-earnings basis. And these two stocks' PEG ratios are essentially the same, which makes sense since they're expected to grow their EPS at basically the same rate over the next half-decade. So, I'm going to call it a draw in terms of valuation.Advantage: Neither With these two home-improvement stocks trading at similar valuation levels, Sherwin-Williams' more defensible competitive position and greater revenue growth prospects make it the better buy today.

It's worth noting that while the company has historically retained the original names of portfolio companies, the Berkshire moniker is front and center for the brokerage business. That might explain why you've been seeing it on an increasing number of signs around your neighborhood.On a financial basis, Berkshire's real-estate segment reported earnings of $220 million last year, a slight decline from the previous year. However, the company's full-year sales surged by 23% on a year-over-year basis, according to its annual report.One of the most formative events in the history of the HomeServices business came in October 2012, when it acquired a 66.7% interest on one of the largest residential real-estate brokerage franchises in the US.Berkshire's home brokerage business will be just one of many businesses discussed at the firm's annual shareholder meeting, which is scheduled for May 5.

In fact, Walmart stock is actually up since last Wednesday’s close, not down like a majority of stocks. Does that make Walmart stock a screaming buy?Perhaps not a screaming buy, but it could be a buy as we gear up for the holiday season. As the fight intensifies between brick-and-mortar retail and ecommerce players, we’re seeing the winners separate from the losers.The winners like Walmart, Target (NYSE:TGT), Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS) and TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) are beefing up while the losers like Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD) and J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) continue to flutter toward zero.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis isn’t seen just with revenue, but also the stock prices. That leaves us wondering, are stocks like Walmart a buy going into year-end or should we take a pass on them?Let’s look at some pros and cons. 3 Proven Principles for Building Wealth There are a few cons to consider for Walmart stock. Compared to companies like KSS, TJX, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart has painfully stifling growth. Expectations call for just 3% revenue growth this year and 2.9% in 2019. That’s despite the robust economic backdrop and the company’s various e-commerce efforts.The earnings front isn’t much better. While estimates call for 9.3% growth this year, a lot of that can be attributed to the tax-cut bump. In 2019, estimates call for a 60 basis point decline in earnings. For this, investors are currently paying 19.6 times earnings. Not nauseatingly expensive, but far from cheap.While Walmart does pay a 2.2% dividend yield, that’s now below what investors can collect on a one-year, two-year, five-year or ten-year Treasury note. As rates go up, as they’re likely to do, WMT’s yield will look less and less attractive.Finally, retail is usually a big winner in the second half. There’s back-to-school sales in late summer, which are realizes in third-quarter earnings, then there’s holiday shopping in the last two months of the year.However, the SPDR Retail Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) has been on fire through the summer, driving up many retail stocks already. Are they setting up as a sell-the-news event before the seasonally strong time of year? They might be, particularly as early forecast are calling tough holiday comps.With all that said, there are some positives for Walmart stock. For starters, it’s the largest retailer in the country. So while the economy is doing well, the truth is Walmart draws in buyers in good times and bad. After all, people have to eat, right?That’s one reason why Walmart has so many buy-and-hold investors on its roster. It’s also part of the reason why it can justify a valuation of nearly 20 times earnings.The future of retail is a frightening thought. For fund managers who need sector exposure, looking for the best growth isn’t the only consideration; they need to know which ones will survive. While WMT is not exactly a growth company, it’s making a lot of necessary long-term investments to stay relevant in the decades to come. Click to EnlargeFurther, while retail may be up big, WMT stock isn’t necessarily in that category. In Q2 and Q3, the XRT rose more than 18%, while the stock price climbed just over 9%. A big part of that jump occurred in August, when the retailer reported earnings.All of this is to say that, while many retailers have gone on to make new highs (the XRT notched its 52-week high in mid-August) Walmart has not taken out its highs from January yet.That brings us to the stock. Shares are now consolidating in a tight descending channel. A close over this channel could trigger a rally back to $100. Above that and its $108 highs are in sight.A break below puts the 200-day and the $88-ish support level in play. Both can be buying opportunities.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

This list gives a new spotlight to Latina women executives and amplifies their exposure across the country. In fact, three of the women on the list joined a corporate board last year.This year, the nominees for our Most Powerful Latina list nearly doubled, with 15 business leaders joining the list for the first time, including Jessica Alba, acclaimed actress and entrepreneur, at number 10. These 50 Latina executives are running Fortune 500 companies, large private firms, and a few are entrepreneurs leading global companies. The four-criteria used were: the size and importance of the woman’s business in the global economy, the health and direction of the business, the arc of the woman’s career—résumé and runway ahead—and their social and cultural influence.This year’s list of powerful Latina women prioritizes women leading large public companies with significant global operating roles, rather than c-level staff roles.

This list gives a new spotlight to Latina women executives and amplifies their exposure across the country. In fact, three of the women on the list joined a corporate board last year.This year, the nominees for our Most Powerful Latina list nearly doubled, with 15 business leaders joining the list for the first time, including Jessica Alba, acclaimed actress and entrepreneur, at number 10. These 50 Latina executives are running Fortune 500 companies, large private firms, and a few are entrepreneurs leading global companies. The four-criteria used were: the size and importance of the woman’s business in the global economy, the health and direction of the business, the arc of the woman’s career—résumé and runway ahead—and their social and cultural influence.This year’s list of powerful Latina women prioritizes women leading large public companies with significant global operating roles, rather than c-level staff roles. It then ranks Latina women operating large private firms and, finally, entrepreneurs who have successfully scaled their businesses into the middle market.The accomplishments of these powerful Latinas are significant. The list serves as a platform to continue their legacy and amplify their voices to inspire the next generation of women.These women have received powerful advice along the way.

However, capitalism is brutal, so few businesses are truly capable of thriving over the ultra-long term. That's why investors need to be extremely picky about which stocks they choose to buy and hold for decades.So which stocks do we believe can create shareholder value over the next half-century? We asked a team of Fool.com contributors to weigh in, and they picked Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), Tellurian (NASDAQ: TELL), and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX).Image source: Getty Images.Anders Bylund (Procter & Gamble): Among the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average members of 1968, exactly two remain there 50 years later. Chemical giant DowDuPont works in an industry I don't follow closely, so that company's long-term future isn't obvious.But I would bet all the bread in my basket that Procter & Gamble will stick around for another half-decade -- and beyond.Let's say you picked up some P&G stock a mere three decades ago, when leg warmers and Motley Crue were all the rage. Today, you're looking back at a massive 1,710% return that left the S&P 500 index far behind at just 974%. In other words, an original investment of $10,000 would be worth more than $180,000 30 years later.PG data by YCharts.If you also reinvested P&G's generous dividends in more shares along the way, the return swells to 3,670% and the old $10,000 investment would now be worth nearly $370,000. Again, the consumer products giant left the broader market far behind:PG Total Return Price data by YCharts.Over the same period, the company's annual earnings grew nearly seven times larger while revenue increased 12-fold. It hasn't always been a smooth ride, with several sharp share price drops along the way, but P&G always comes back swinging.As long as people all around the world need toothpaste, batteries, laundry detergent, and/or deodorant -- which I assume will be forever -- Procter & Gamble is likely to stay relevant. This is a stock you can pass on to your great-great-grandkids a hundred years from now.Maxx Chatsko (Tellurian): Considering there aren't any commercial operations to speak of right now, investors would be forgiven for overlooking Tellurian. But if you give me 50 years, then I'm strongly considering placing an ultra-long-term bet on the energy stock. That's because the company has an intriguing plan to shake up the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market.Consider that the first companies to bet on LNG markets needed to raise tens of billions of dollars in debt to fund the construction of massively expensive production facilities and export terminals. While it has worked out exceptionally well for pioneer Cheniere Energy -- which has delivered 10-year stock gains of 2,090% and sports a $16 billion market cap -- it entered the year with $25 billion in consolidated debt. More important for investors to consider is the fact that customers today are much less willing to enter into supply agreements of similar length and volume. In other words, the very agreements necessary for companies building LNG facilities to secure the debt required at decently favorable prices.So what if a company could build gargantuan LNG facilities without so much debt? Enter Tellurian.The $1.9 billion company is developing a $30 billion LNG project called Driftwood. The enormous Gulf Coast facility would be able to ship 4 billion cubic feet per day of product, enough to power 20 million U.S. homes for a day. But it wants to do things differently. Instead of raising ridiculous amounts of debt to build a facility and selling LNG for a fixed fee, the company plans to sell equity in Driftwood to customers and sell the LNG at cost. That would smooth out volatility from commodity markets and allow the company to scale projects more quickly and cheaply than peers.More importantly, the business model could address the increasingly differing needs of LNG customers and those of heavily indebted producers with laser-like precision. That provides confidence that Tellurian's strategy will have little trouble catching on, as does the list of current partners, which includes Total SA, General Electric, and Bechtel. Of course, this is a complex investment with many moving parts and question marks. But if everything works out, then a small investment today could be worth quite a bit more in a few decades' time.Brian Feroldi (Starbucks): I have no idea what everyday life will look in five decades' time, but I'm willing to bet that humans will still need a cup of joe to help them get moving in the morning. That's why Starbucks ranks as one of the few companies that I own that I could see myself owning for the next half-century.But what is it about Starbucks that makes me believe so much in its long-term potential? Let me count the ways:It sells an addictive product that is an easily affordable luxury.The company's strong brand and ubiquity in everyday life gives it strong pricing power.Starbucks' enormous scale gives it buying power that should help it to maintain margins over time.Food, consumer packaged goods, digital rewards, drive-thrus, international expansion, and Reserve represent multiple paths toward growth.The company's strong corporate culture and focus on conscious capitalism helps to make it built to last.Starbucks has a history of using its financial might to reward shareholders.Overall, I believe that these factors make Starbucks well-positioned to thrive over the long term. With shares currently on sale, I think right now is a fantastic time for investors to hitch their wagon to this perennial winner.

However, capitalism is brutal, so few businesses are truly capable of thriving over the ultra-long term. That's why investors need to be extremely picky about which stocks they choose to buy and hold for decades.So which stocks do we believe can create shareholder value over the next half-century? We asked a team of Fool.com contributors to weigh in, and they picked Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), Tellurian (NASDAQ: TELL), and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX).Image source: Getty Images.Anders Bylund (Procter & Gamble): Among the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average members of 1968, exactly two remain there 50 years later. Chemical giant DowDuPont works in an industry I don't follow closely, so that company's long-term future isn't obvious.But I would bet all the bread in my basket that Procter & Gamble will stick around for another half-decade -- and beyond.Let's say you picked up some P&G stock a mere three decades ago, when leg warmers and Motley Crue were all the rage. Today, you're looking back at a massive 1,710% return that left the S&P 500 index far behind at just 974%. In other words, an original investment of $10,000 would be worth more than $180,000 30 years later.PG data by YCharts.If you also reinvested P&G's generous dividends in more shares along the way, the return swells to 3,670% and the old $10,000 investment would now be worth nearly $370,000. Again, the consumer products giant left the broader market far behind:PG Total Return Price data by YCharts.Over the same period, the company's annual earnings grew nearly seven times larger while revenue increased 12-fold. It hasn't always been a smooth ride, with several sharp share price drops along the way, but P&G always comes back swinging.As long as people all around the world need toothpaste, batteries, laundry detergent, and/or deodorant -- which I assume will be forever -- Procter & Gamble is likely to stay relevant. This is a stock you can pass on to your great-great-grandkids a hundred years from now.Maxx Chatsko (Tellurian): Considering there aren't any commercial operations to speak of right now, investors would be forgiven for overlooking Tellurian. But if you give me 50 years, then I'm strongly considering placing an ultra-long-term bet on the energy stock. That's because the company has an intriguing plan to shake up the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market.Consider that the first companies to bet on LNG markets needed to raise tens of billions of dollars in debt to fund the construction of massively expensive production facilities and export terminals. While it has worked out exceptionally well for pioneer Cheniere Energy -- which has delivered 10-year stock gains of 2,090% and sports a $16 billion market cap -- it entered the year with $25 billion in consolidated debt. More important for investors to consider is the fact that customers today are much less willing to enter into supply agreements of similar length and volume. In other words, the very agreements necessary for companies building LNG facilities to secure the debt required at decently favorable prices.So what if a company could build gargantuan LNG facilities without so much debt? Enter Tellurian.The $1.9 billion company is developing a $30 billion LNG project called Driftwood. The enormous Gulf Coast facility would be able to ship 4 billion cubic feet per day of product, enough to power 20 million U.S. homes for a day. But it wants to do things differently. Instead of raising ridiculous amounts of debt to build a facility and selling LNG for a fixed fee, the company plans to sell equity in Driftwood to customers and sell the LNG at cost. That would smooth out volatility from commodity markets and allow the company to scale projects more quickly and cheaply than peers.More importantly, the business model could address the increasingly differing needs of LNG customers and those of heavily indebted producers with laser-like precision. That provides confidence that Tellurian's strategy will have little trouble catching on, as does the list of current partners, which includes Total SA, General Electric, and Bechtel. Of course, this is a complex investment with many moving parts and question marks. But if everything works out, then a small investment today could be worth quite a bit more in a few decades' time.Brian Feroldi (Starbucks): I have no idea what everyday life will look in five decades' time, but I'm willing to bet that humans will still need a cup of joe to help them get moving in the morning. That's why Starbucks ranks as one of the few companies that I own that I could see myself owning for the next half-century.But what is it about Starbucks that makes me believe so much in its long-term potential? Let me count the ways:It sells an addictive product that is an easily affordable luxury.The company's strong brand and ubiquity in everyday life gives it strong pricing power.Starbucks' enormous scale gives it buying power that should help it to maintain margins over time.Food, consumer packaged goods, digital rewards, drive-thrus, international expansion, and Reserve represent multiple paths toward growth.The company's strong corporate culture and focus on conscious capitalism helps to make it built to last.Starbucks has a history of using its financial might to reward shareholders.Overall, I believe that these factors make Starbucks well-positioned to thrive over the long term. With shares currently on sale, I think right now is a fantastic time for investors to hitch their wagon to this perennial winner.

After having lost more than 500 points in the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished with a triple-digit gain, and other major benchmarks also bounced back into the green by the day's end. Chinese retaliation on the trade front initially raised concerns of a full-blown trade war, but investors quickly quashed those fears and focused instead on hoped-for strength in companies' fundamental performance in the coming earnings season. Good news from some key individual stocks also contributed to a positive mood. Frontier Communications (NASDAQ: FTR), Triangle Capital (NYSE: TCAP), and Hormel Foods (NYSE: HRL) were among the best performers on the day. Here's why they did so well.Shares of Frontier Communications jumped 9% on speculation that the telecommunications company would seek advice on some potential strategic moves. Reports suggested that Frontier had engaged an investment banking specialist to help it with potential divestitures of assets. If true, the move would make sense as Frontier tries to work its way through an extensive debt load while focusing its attention on its best future business opportunities. With major acquisitions not having gone as well as shareholders had hoped, Frontier has only a limited amount of time left to make positive moves that can help return the telecom company to a more successful trajectory.Image source: Frontier Communications.Triangle Capital stock climbed 10% after the business development company announced the sale of its investment portfolio and a new agreement with an investment advisory firm. Triangle will get $981 million in cash from Benefit Street Partners in exchange for its portfolio of assets, and it will accept an $85 million payment from investment advisory company Barings to become Triangle's advisor. Shareholders will get the benefit of the $85 million payment in the form of a $1.78-per-share distribution, and then Barings will invest the $981 million within the continuing Triangle entity. If investors approve the deal, Triangle could look very different by this summer.Finally, shares of Hormel Foods picked up 5%. The food company behind products like Spam and Dinty Moore beef stew was the subject of a report in The Wall Street Journal suggesting that Hormel has looked at private equity sources to find potentially interesting targets for acquisitions. Despite concerns about Chinese tariffs that would focus on food sellers, Hormel is seeing the benefit of its strategy to stay in front of changing consumer preferences by acquiring popular food companies. Moreover, as long as trade issues don't become overly contentious, Hormel's international strategy to expand into hot areas like Latin America and Asia could deliver even faster growth in the future.

(NYSE:HPQ), the computer and printer arm of the former Hewlett Packard, and reminded investors that the company’s 2015 break-up worked.Since the split of HP Inc. from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE:HPE) became final in November of that year, both stocks have done very well. HPE is up 42%. HPQ has done even better, up 67%. By way of comparison, the NASDAQ composite is up just 31%.The strong performance will add patina to the legacy of Meg Whitman, who engineered the break-up as CEO of the combined company after losing her race to become California governor in 2010. Her skeptics, and I was among them, owe her an apology. Whitman has moved on to become CEO of NewTV, a mobile media start-up created by DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHP has helped lead a big comeback for the U.S. PC industry, even if most manufacturing remains Chinese. 6 Large Cap Value ETFs to Buy in a Shaky Market It’s not fast growth, but it’s growth nonetheless. HP did $52 billion in business during fiscal 2017, and after two quarters of its 2018 fiscal year is on pace to beat that handily. Year over year growth for the second quarter came in at 13%, free cash flow has more than doubled, and fully diluted earnings per share were up 94%. The result on May 30 was a quick 2.5% gain in the stock price, the reaction dampened somewhat by news that Cathie Lesjak, the chief financial officer who is credited with the improved results, announced her retirement. Lesjak had ridden through the decade of scandals and missteps under Mark Hurd and, briefly, Leo Apatheker, before taking the HP Inc. job.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which took the cloud and services businesses that were expected to do well after the split, has not done terribly either.Its second-quarter revenue came in at $7.5 billion, up 10% year over year, and 6% in constant currency. Margins nearly doubled from a year earlier, and fully diluted earnings per share came in at 54 cents, compared with a loss in the previous year. The company also raised its guidance for the third quarter.While the business of HP is easy to understand — printers and computers — the business of HPE is a little more difficult. It’s basically a mini-cloud “arms merchant,” selling systems and services to companies building “hybrid clouds” that connect older data centers to existing clouds.Despite the earnings beat, shares fell on a warning from CEO Antonio Neri of a “challenging second half.” The challenge is finding new acquisitions like Cape Networks, a privately held company HPE bought recently as a plug-in to its Aruba Networks unit.The Cape buy brought the company’s cash balance below $7 billion. It also has almost $10 billion in long-term debt. It could also use its stock to make deals, but the post-earnings sell-off made that stock less valuable, so it may have to back off for now.HP’s fall from grace between 2010 and 2013 is now the stuff of business legend. A company that had been a doyen of Silicon Valley was laid low by a succession of bad managements. Amgen, Inc. Clears a Breakout Hurdle Whitman came on board midway through that fall from grace, in September 2011, and took enormous heat for its continuing. But it turned out she did have a clue — to downsize the company, becoming a cloud supplier rather than a true cloud player, and to create two profitable companies out of one unprofitable one.Those who stayed with her have prospered. Those who abandoned her, like me, have been proven wrong.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

We’ll look at HP Inc’s (NYSE:HPQ) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company’s share price. HP has a price to earnings ratio of 8.46, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 12%.  See our latest analysis for HP  The formula for price to earnings  is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for HP:P/E of 8.46 = $23.43 ÷ $2.77 (Based on the year to July 2018.)A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each $1 the company has earned over the last year. That isn’t a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business’s prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.Earnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. When earnings grow, the ‘E’ increases, over time. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others — and that may attract buyers.HP increased earnings per share by a whopping 98% last year. And earnings per share have improved by 4.4% annually, over the last five years. With that performance, I would expect it to have an above average P/E ratio.The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see HP has a lower P/E than the average (22.5) in the tech industry classification.HP’s P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.It’s important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).HP has net debt worth just 0.3% of its market capitalization. So it doesn’t have as many options as it would with net cash, but its debt would not have much of an impact on its P/E ratio.HP trades on a P/E ratio of 8.5, which is below the US market average of 18. The company hasn’t stretched its balance sheet, and earnings growth was good last year. If the company can continue to grow earnings, then the current P/E may be unjustifiably low.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. So this free report on the analyst consensus forecasts could help you make a master move on this stock.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with modest (or no) debt, trading on a P/E below 20.

The drivetrain is stout, overbuilt, and reliable, which means tuners can make big horsepower without breaking stuff. This results in some incredibly quick straight-line speed. Let this video demonstrate.This early 997-generation Porsche 911 Turbo tuned by 9ff puts out an astounding 1600 horsepower from its modified 3.6-liter twin-turbo flat-six, and it ran some impressive numbers at a recent runway event in Germany. Filmed by the Gumbal YouTube channel, the fastest speed the car managed to trap was 206 mph in the half-mile. That is extremely quick. Like, head-scrambginlgly quick.Of course, tuning a 911 Turbo to make around 1100 horsepower more than it came with originally means the car probably isn't as daily-drivable as it was from the factory. We think it's possibly worth the trade-off, though.('You Might Also Like',)16 of the Most Interesting Engine Swaps We've Ever SeenSee 70 Years of the Greatest Ferraris Ever BuiltThese Are the 14 Best New Cars for Less Than $45,000Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.A recent study from the career experts Zety says that 40% of respondents fear retirement more than death.

This lightly crashed twin-turbo 2017 Dodge Viper ACR could be the perfect candidate. It's for sale right now on eBay Motors. You should buy it.Welcome to You Must Buy, our daily look at the cars you really should be buying instead of that boring commuter sedan.This salvage-title Viper looks to have been in some sort of front-end incident that set off the driver's side front airbag and ripped off the front bumper. The front left wheel also looks heavily curbed, but still holds air. Perhaps most worrying is the damage to the bottom of the A-pillar. Some sort of impact looks to have pushed the area in ever so slightly, damaging the windshield. It may not look like much from some angles, but this damage compromised the frame, and therefore, the crash structure. It's probably the main reason it was totaled out.According to the seller, the car has over $35,000 worth of engine upgrades in the form of a 1000-horsepower twin-turbo system with a custom ECU. Everything under the hood looks to be in good condition, and besides that A-pillar damage, the the body seems in good shape. The odometer reads just 2151 miles.Though it'd probably be a pain to get registered for the road, there's nothing stopping you from buying this thing, tweaking the frame back into place, replacing the bumper and windshield, throwing in a cage and other safety equipment, and taking it to your local AER or NASA, or Gridlife racing event. We're not sure how well that twin-turbo system would hold up during continuous lapping, but we bet you'd at least be able to do well in a time attack competition. It's listed on eBay right now with a Buy It Now price of $111,000.('You Might Also Like',)16 of the Most Interesting Engine Swaps We've Ever SeenSee 70 Years of the Greatest Ferraris Ever BuiltThese Are the 14 Best New Cars for Less Than $45,000Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.A recent study from the career experts Zety says that 40% of respondents fear retirement more than death.

( HUM).Walmart investors seem a bit underwhelmed by the prospect of a union, but analysts say Walmart and Humana are a powerful team even without a merger.[See: The 9 Best ETFs for Retail Power.]CNBC reported that Walmart and Humana have had early-stage talks about strengthening their partnership, including a possible merger. With a potential price tag approaching $50 billion, a Humana buyout would be the largest acquisition Walmart has ever made.However, the health care industry has been shifting to a more consolidated look in recent months in light of several other blockbuster deals. In December, CVS Health Corp. ( CVS) announced a $69 billion buyout deal for Aetna ( AET). Walmart's prime retail competitor, Amazon.com ( AMZN), also recently announced a new health care collaboration with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ( JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A, BRK.B).The threat of Amazon and other competitors entering the health care business has put pressure on Walmart to respond, but making such a massive acquisition could create challenges for a company which is already heavily investing in online sales and delivery initiatives.""We believe an outright acquisition would be modestly accretive to Walmart earnings and potentially additive to store traffic, though would also meaningfully increase business complexity and risks,"" Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan says.Instead of a buyout, Astrachan says a slightly less aggressive approach of Walmart expanding its current prescription drug partnership with Humana might be a more prudent move for Walmart.""We view this as a more favorable near-term option in that it would allow Walmart to learn more about the healthcare industry, and likely include closer ties that could add to Walmart's store traffic while also potentially reducing costs,"" Astrachan says.[See: 9 Ways to Buy Stocks That Everyone Needs.]If Walmart instead decides to pull the trigger on a buyout, Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman says Walmart investors should expect further negative market reaction in the short term.""Investors may question whether WMT would have too many balls in the air at a time of meaningful change, or if WMT is trying to deflect attention away from e-commerce,"" Gutman says. Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley sees a potential deal as a long-term positive for WMT stock.Morgan Stanley has an ""equal-weight"" rating and $99 price target for Walmart. Stifel has a ""hold"" rating and $99 target for WMT stock.More From US News & World Report Buy and Hold: Be an Investing Expert Like Warren Buffett8 Stocks to Buy For a Starter Portfolio9 Food-Focused ETFs to Feed Your PortfolioTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.A recent study from the career experts Zety says that 40% of respondents fear retirement more than death.

HUM recently announced that it has finally completed the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary, KMG America Corporation (“KMG”), to the unit of Texas-based insurance company, HC2 Holdings, Inc. HCHC. The subsidiary is called Continental General Insurance Company (“CGIC”). Kanawha Insurance Company (“KIC”), the arm of KMG includes Humana’s closed block of non-strategic commercial long-term care insurance policies, catering to around 29,300 policyholders. As of Mar 31, 2018, KIC had around $150 million in statutory surplus and $160 million of statutory total adjusted capital with approximately $2.4 billion of cash and invested assets. Humana contributed around $195 million of capital to KIC under the Stock Purchase Agreement.Humana expects this transaction to benefit its policyholders on the back of CGIC’s significant experience in the commercial long-term care insurance market. It also estimates to face a net loss of $400 million or $2.75 per common share under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This projected loss includes a pretax figure of around $900 million, partially offset by the tax gain of $500 million.After the transaction is complete, CGIC will have cash and invested assets of around $3.8 billion, much more than the pre-transaction possession of $1.5 billion. Moreover, with the deal’s closure, pro-forma statutory surplus for the combined entities is predicted in the $155-$175 million bracket and the total adjusted capital is anticipated between $185 million and $205 million, subject to closing adjustments.Meanwhile, HC2 would be able to expand its insurance investment portfolio and increase the total adjusted insurance capital base by a skyrocketing margin.

(NASDAQ: AMD), Shah said in a note, and Intel's stock has simply run out of upside after gaining more than 50 percent in the past year.“INTC’s multiple started compressing before Mr. Krzanich’s departure; lack of clear leadership will likely only add to the already growing uncertainty about Intel’s long-term outlook,” Shah said in the downgrade note.In terms of Krzanich’s replacement, Shah said Intel’s product group head Murthy Renduchintala is the most likely candidate. However, Shah said outside hires such as Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO)’s Hock Tan or GlobalFoundries’ Sanjay Jha might be better qualified for the position.Looking ahead, Shah still sees impressive growth numbers from Intel in the next several years. Shah has raised his 2018 and 2019 EPS estimates from $3.85 and $4.33 to $4.16 and $4.40, respectively.Shah’s $55 price target represents a 12.5 times multiple on that 2019 EPS estimate, in the middle of the stock’s historical earnings multiple range. The stock will likely continue to see downside valuation protection in the 11 times multiple range.Price ActionIntel traded lower by more than 2 percent Monday morning following the downgrade.Related Links:Bernstein Pumps The Brakes On AMD: 'Expectations Have Soared' What The Latest Steam Gaming Data Means For AMD, NvidiaLatest Ratings for INTCJun 2018NomuraDowngradesBuyNeutralJun 2018Morgan StanleyMaintainsEqual-WeightEqual-WeightJun 2018Northland SecuritiesDowngradesMarket PerformUnderperformView More Analyst Ratings for INTC  View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaWhat The Latest Steam Gaming Data Means For AMD, NvidiaBofA Highlights The Most 'Underowned' Semi Stocks© 2018 Benzinga.com.

While the impressive ratio tells us that INTC has made significant profits from little equity capital, ROE doesn’t tell us if INTC has borrowed debt to make this happen. We’ll take a closer look today at factors like financial leverage to determine whether INTC’s ROE is actually sustainable.  Check out our latest analysis for Intel  Return on Equity (ROE) weighs Intel’s profit against the level of its shareholders’ equity. It essentially shows how much the company can generate in earnings given the amount of equity it has raised. In most cases, a higher ROE is preferred; however, there are many other factors we must consider prior to making any investment decisions.Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders EquityROE is assessed against cost of equity, which is measured using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) – but let’s not dive into the details of that today. For now, let’s just look at the cost of equity number for Intel, which is 10.88%. This means Intel returns enough to cover its own cost of equity, with a buffer of 8.10%. This sustainable practice implies that the company pays less for its capital than what it generates in return. ROE can be split up into three useful ratios: net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. This is called the Dupont Formula:ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverageROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity)ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equityEssentially, profit margin shows how much money the company makes after paying for all its expenses. Asset turnover shows how much revenue Intel can generate with its current asset base. And finally, financial leverage is simply how much of assets are funded by equity, which exhibits how sustainable the company’s capital structure is. Since ROE can be artificially increased through excessive borrowing, we should check Intel’s historic debt-to-equity ratio. At 40.18%, Intel’s debt-to-equity ratio appears low and indicates the above-average ROE is generated from its capacity to increase profit without a large debt burden.ROE is one of many ratios which meaningfully dissects financial statements, which illustrates the quality of a company. Intel’s ROE is impressive relative to the industry average and also covers its cost of equity. ROE is not likely to be inflated by excessive debt funding, giving shareholders more conviction in the sustainability of high returns. ROE is a helpful signal, but it is definitely not sufficient on its own to make an investment decision.For Intel, I’ve compiled three pertinent factors you should further examine:Financial Health: Does it have a healthy balance sheet?

We had more material from my interviews than we had time to broadcast. So, here’s a look at some of the behind-the-scenes tales we couldn’t fit on TV.In 1968—if you do the math, that’s 50 years ago—computers were as big as rooms. They were comparatively slow and consumed massive amounts of power.At the company he’d co-founded, Fairchild Semiconductor, engineer Bob Noyce had co-invented a different approach: integrated electronics, where the circuitry was printed, or etched, onto tiny slices of the element silicon.At that time, integrated electronics cost many times more than the existing technology (small, can-shaped transistors plugged into a circuit board). But they were much smaller and easier to manufacture. Noyce and his buddy Gordon Moore figured that the price would come down—and that silicon chips were the future.And so, 50 years ago today, they quit Fairchild and started a new company. It became one of the giants of the modern world, defining the PC era, helping give Silicon Valley its name, and becoming a technological and marketing colossus.You may know the name of the company they founded that day: NM Electronics.By the end of the month, of course, they adopted a better name, short for integrated electronics: Intel.Noyce and Moore’s original plan was to produce memory chips. Intel’s first product debuted nine months later: The 3101 memory chip, the world’s first solid-state RAM chip.But by 1971, Intel had introduced its first microprocessor—a chip to process data, not just store it—which eventually became Intel’s bread and butter, and the enabler for the entire world of electronics we know today.“In 1969, a Japanese calculator company called Nippon [Calculating Machine Corporation] contacted Intel,” says Elizabeth Jones, Intel’s archivist and museum curator. “They wanted Intel to create for them a series of chips that could run their adding machines. Intel took the job. We ended up producing four chips for them, one of them being the 4004.“In hindsight, they realized that the 4004, programmed differently, could run different things than just an adding machine,” Jones says.“Intel went back to Nippon and requested the design rights to the chip. And Nippon said, ‘We don’t really need the design rights. We’ll sell you back the design rights for the investment we made in the design—$60,000.’ Intel repurchased the design rights and were able to then start marketing this as a true general purpose microprocessor. And that was in 1971.”John Doerr is the chairman of Kleiner Perkins, one of the world’s most successful venture capital firms. He began his career working at Intel—and he’s been a keen observer ever since.“In the summer of ’74, I came to Silicon Valley with no job, no place to live, $50 in my pocket,” he says. “My girlfriend had dumped me, so I was looking for her. I was pretty persistent—she rightly wanted to avoid me.“I cold-called my way into the highest-ranking Intel executive I could get on the phone, Dr. Bill Davidow. And they interviewed me, and I got a job writing benchmarks to show that Intel’s microprocessors were superior to the ones from Motorola. To my delight, right down the hall from where my summer job was, was my girlfriend! When I showed up there, she was not amused at all. But over the course of the summer, we put the relationship back together again, and we’ve now been married for 40 years.”According to everyone I spoke to, Intel’s success owes a lot to its corporate culture, as set by Noyce, Moore, and their third employee, Andy Grove (whom they also hired away from Fairchild).“One of the important lessons I took away from Intel was the importance of culture and values,” Doerr says. “Andy Grove and the other Intel leaders concluded that Intel’s culture was one of aggressive introverts, engineers who wanted to systemically solve problems by having an environment that wasn’t hierarchical, but where the best ideas could all get put on the table and the best idea would win.“So a very apolitical environment, one that is rigorous, ruthlessly intellectually honest, and of course very competitive. And I think that’s true of Intel then, it’s true of Intel today. It’s certainly been regarded by many—me included—one of the, if not the, best managed technology company in the world.”“Intel has a very egalitarian culture,” adds historian Jones. “No one has an office with a door, everyone is in cubicles—even the CEO. No reserved parking spots.”“You know, Andy Grove grabbed me once,” Doerr says. “And he said something I’ll remember forever. He said, ‘John, it almost doesn’t matter what you know. What matters is results. Ideas are easy, it’s execution that’s everything.’ That’s become a mantra of mine: ideas are easy, execution’s everything.”Shifting the company from a memory maker to a processor maker was “a wrenching transition,” Doerr says.In 1980, an unidentified customer for Intel’s processors, based in Boca Raton, Fla., agreed to use a version of Intel’s 16-bit microprocessor called the 8088. That customer turned out to be IBM. The 8088 was to be the brains of its new machine for consumers, the PC.“And then Bill Gates wrote an operating system for it, and thus began what’s called the Wintel Monopoly, if you will, as most of the PCs and most of the PC software was written to take advantage of that very high-volume platform,” Doerr says.And if IBM chosen some other company’s chip that day?“Intel probably wouldn’t be here today.”In Intel’s 50 years, it has had six CEOs. Three of them were the company’s founders, Noyce, Moore (of the famous Moore’s Law), and Andy Grove.“Somehow, Intel’s CEOs have alternated hot and cool personalities,” Doerr says. “So Bob Noyce was very emotive and outgoing and smooth, and Gordon was very quiet, almost introverted, introspective. Andy Grove was a fiery, hot personality. Craig Barrett, more cerebral; he ran manufacturing.“Paul Otellini was a broad-based leader, but effusive and a guy who could put together a deal with Steve Jobs that Andy Grove could never could. And then Brian Krzanich, who rose through the ranks as a manufacturing leader is a very—again, kind of on cool personality. And interestingly, all of these grown from within. They never recruited from outside the company.”Intel’s record of execution has been impressive—how many tech companies are still thriving after 50 years?—but not flawless. It has had to weather the occasional technical embarrassment, like the Pentium bug in 1994 or the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities earlier this year.More seriously, Intel mostly missed the smartphone wave. “It’s fairly well-documented that along the way, we missed the CPU or the modem that’s inside the phone,” interim CEO Bob Swan told me. “That being said, we adjusted, adapted, and got into powering PCs, tablets, phones, data centers, cars, et cetera. So we are a player of supplying modems and technologies into phones today.”As the world moved away from PCs, the company’s bread and butter, into mobile devices, the company lost its position as the world’s biggest chip maker (it’s now in second place, after Samsung), and had to lay off thousands of workers in 2009, 2014, and 2016.On the other hand, Intel has made up much of the difference by supplying the processors for the world’s data centers—better known as the Cloud.Today, Intel is investing heavily into self-driving cars and AI technologies. The goal is to carry on Noyce and Moore’s vision for another 50 years, and beyond.“The makeup of the company started with the founders,” says CEO Swan. “And [Bob Noyce] said these simple words back 50 years ago: ‘Don’t be encumbered by the past. Go and do something wonderful.’ And those simple words from our founders…I kinda see every day in this company.”—David Pogue, tech columnist for Yahoo Finance, welcomes comments below.

But for all the similarities in tone between the latest scandal and the notorious Pentium FDIV bug over two decades ago, the details of the story and the company's reaction to the bug's revelation are vastly different. That's a very good thing.In 1994, Intel was on top of the semiconductor world. It held a virtual monopoly in the supreme chip type, the microprocessor. And it was in the midst of the most successful marketing campaign in tech history--""Intel Inside""--which taught consumers to think past the PC box to the chips within. With Internet usage ramping up, it seemed like nothing could stop Intel.Then, in June of that year, Thomas Nicely, a mathematics professor from Lynchburg College in Virginia, used his computer to perform an arithmetic calculation and got the wrong answer. Within weeks, the world had learned about this Pentium chip ""bug."" The Internet had recently set off a PC boom, and now millions of new users thought those machines might be lying to them.Panic ensued. By mid-November, lawsuits were being filed against Intel. The Wall Street Journal was covering the story almost daily. People feared planes falling out the sky, missiles firing spontaneously, or the electrical grid shutting down. There was talk of a congressional investigation. publicly announced it was suspending shipment of its Pentium-based computers. The Pentium bug had become a full-on disaster.Intel had been blindsided. Bugs had always been part of the semiconductor industry. But until then the company had mostly sold its chips to engineers and scientists, who knew how they worked and fixed them if necessary. But with ""Intel Inside,"" Intel had entered into a social contract with consumers, whose expectations were completely different. Rattled, Intel, led by its fiery CEO Andy Grove, responded with one publicity blunder after another, all but suggesting the public were idiots for being so concerned.Then, remarkably, after some soul-searching, Grove did the unimaginable: He reversed himself. On Monday, Dec. 21, 1994, Intel announced that it would replace the bugged chips. The Pentium bug crisis was over. (As it turns out, very few chips were actually returned by users, proving that in a crisis, perception is more important than reality.)Now Intel finds itself in another scandal--and the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities are much more widespread and dangerous than the FDIV bug. Its competitors, notably AMD and ARM, are also embroiled in the crisis. But their problem is a software fix that only concerns the Spectre attack (hence their stock jump on the news). Since Meltdown also affects Intel's hardware, the company will need to redesign future chips and eventually replace current chips that are vulnerable.The 1994 Pentium bug exposed an anomaly, whereas this time the problem is ubiquitous: It potentially opens a backdoor for hackers to access operations of the processor itself. And it is not just present in one Intel chip model, but dates back at least two decades. That means it affects billions of computers and other devices, some of them embedded in very sensitive applications and in the cloud.But despite the gravity of the current situation, it's clear that Intel and the broader industry have learned their lesson. Intel appears to have immediately addressed the problem and notified vendors, keeping it secret from the public only long enough to put countermeasures in place. Then it told the world.While corporate IT types no doubt are pulling out their hair and lawsuits are being prepared, average consumers--infinitely more technically sophisticated than they were in 1994, and battered by years of viruses and hacks--seem to be taking this latest insult (and possible slowed performance of their computers due to the inevitable workarounds) with rueful acceptance. That's also a sign of progress.Intel dodged a big bill--but paid in its public image--the last time around. I suspect that today, the opposite will be true.Michael S.

However, as the company began facing fiercer competition and stagnation in per-core performance, the company has worked to build more compelling products by boosting the number of processor cores in its chips.Image source: Intel.Next year, Intel is expected to introduce a new processor architecture, known as Ice Lake. Thanks to long-overdue design improvements, Intel should finally begin to deliver significant per-core performance improvements in its gaming chips.With that being said, while I think Intel will try its best to keep pushing per-core performance up in its gaming chips (especially since games tend to benefit greatly from faster cores), it also seems reasonable to expect Intel to keep pushing core counts up. I wouldn't be surprised, for example, to see Intel's follow-on to the eight-core Coffee Lake chip, which will be based on its Ice Lake architecture, to come in configurations with up to 10 cores.Here are two reasons why.The reality is that it's relatively simple to market additional processor cores to consumers. If a gamer bought a four core processor for $300 in 2014 and can get twice that many cores for roughly the same price in 2019, then that could prove to be a compelling value proposition that drives upgrade activity.Additionally, Intel talks about how it aims to deliver big advances in chip manufacturing technologies that allow it to more than double the number of transistors -- the building blocks of a computer chip -- with each new generation. One way to take advantage of those new manufacturing technologies is to simply add more processor cores to chips while keeping chip manufacturing costs in check.Finally, while much consumer software doesn't make good use of many processor cores, some critical types of software -- like video games -- seem to be making better use of additional processor cores. The more the software ecosystem takes advantage of additional processor cores, the more marketable processors with higher core counts become.While I expect Intel to continue to increase the number of cores that it offers at a given price point, I also expect the company to introduce higher core count gaming parts as a way to drive up its average selling prices, which would ultimately boost revenue and profit for the chip maker.For example, I could see the Ice Lake desktop processor family coming in configurations with four, six, eight, and 10 cores. The four-, six-, and eight-core parts could all come in at roughly the same prices that their corresponding Coffee Lake predecessors did. The key selling points there would be the per-core improvements, enhancements elsewhere in the chip, as well as overall platform features. Additionally, a 10-core part could come in at a reasonable premium to the eight-core part.As long as Intel applies its usual segmentation tricks to such products (e.g. making sure the higher core count parts are superior in ways beyond just core count), this strategy could have a positive impact on the company's business and deliver real value for stockholders over the long term.

One of the best ways for investors to mitigate risk in a particular sector is to use pair trades; a new commentary from Stifel suggests Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) could be prime candidates.The AnalystAnalyst Kevin Cassidy downgraded Intel from Buy to Hold and reiterated a $53 price target. Cassidy upgraded AMD from Hold to Buy and reiterated a $13 price target.The ThesisIn the past six months, Intel and AMD shares have been headed in opposite directions, with Intel up 27.8 percent and AMD down 23.6 percent.Intel stock no longer looks like a value, while the market is not fully appreciating the margin expansion opportunity at AMD, Cassidy said in a Wednesday note. (See the analyst's track record here.)The analyst said he's been bullish on Intel throughout its Xeon Scalable upgrade cycle, but the cycle could soon come to an end.“We now believe the upgrade cycle could peak in 2H18, while longer-term the company could face challenges from evolving data center architectures.""AMD stock has become oversold ahead of its EPYC server CPU ramp in the second half of the year, Cassidy said. Investors don’t seem to be appreciating AMD’s full lineup of PC CPUs, the analyst said.“We are upgrading AMD shares as we believe they are oversold due to cryptocurrency concerns, while the company has potential for revenue growth and GM expansion from the ramp of its Epyc and Ryzen processors.""Based on Cassidy’s conclusions, investors who would like to maintain exposure to the semiconductor space and avoid some of the risks of a broad market downturn should consider a pair trade with Intel as the short side and AMD as the long side.Price ActionFollowing the ratings changes, AMD stock was up 4.2 percent on Thursday morning, while Intel stock was up 1.16 percent.Related Links:Evercore: Nvidia Can 'Power Through' Bitmain Ethereum Mining TailwindsAnalyst: Bitmain's New Ethereum Mining Chip Could Spell A Little Bit Of Trouble For AMD And NvidiaLatest Ratings for INTCApr 2018Tigress FinancialUpgradesNeutralBuyApr 2018UBSInitiates Coverage OnBuyApr 2018Stifel NicolausDowngradesBuyHoldView More Analyst Ratings for INTC  View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaAnalyst: Bitmain's New Ethereum Mining Chip Could Spell A Little Bit Of Trouble For AMD And NvidiaHow Intel Might Be Affected If It Loses Apple As A CustomerBank Of America Adds Nvidia To Top Stock List After Latest Gaming Checks© 2018 Benzinga.com.

One of the best ways for investors to mitigate risk in a particular sector is to use pair trades; a new commentary from Stifel suggests Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) could be prime candidates.The AnalystAnalyst Kevin Cassidy downgraded Intel from Buy to Hold and reiterated a $53 price target. Cassidy upgraded AMD from Hold to Buy and reiterated a $13 price target.The ThesisIn the past six months, Intel and AMD shares have been headed in opposite directions, with Intel up 27.8 percent and AMD down 23.6 percent.Intel stock no longer looks like a value, while the market is not fully appreciating the margin expansion opportunity at AMD, Cassidy said in a Wednesday note. (See the analyst's track record here.)The analyst said he's been bullish on Intel throughout its Xeon Scalable upgrade cycle, but the cycle could soon come to an end.“We now believe the upgrade cycle could peak in 2H18, while longer-term the company could face challenges from evolving data center architectures.""AMD stock has become oversold ahead of its EPYC server CPU ramp in the second half of the year, Cassidy said. Investors don’t seem to be appreciating AMD’s full lineup of PC CPUs, the analyst said.“We are upgrading AMD shares as we believe they are oversold due to cryptocurrency concerns, while the company has potential for revenue growth and GM expansion from the ramp of its Epyc and Ryzen processors.""Based on Cassidy’s conclusions, investors who would like to maintain exposure to the semiconductor space and avoid some of the risks of a broad market downturn should consider a pair trade with Intel as the short side and AMD as the long side.Price ActionFollowing the ratings changes, AMD stock was up 4.2 percent on Thursday morning, while Intel stock was up 1.16 percent.Related Links:Evercore: Nvidia Can 'Power Through' Bitmain Ethereum Mining TailwindsAnalyst: Bitmain's New Ethereum Mining Chip Could Spell A Little Bit Of Trouble For AMD And NvidiaLatest Ratings for INTCApr 2018Tigress FinancialUpgradesNeutralBuyApr 2018UBSInitiates Coverage OnBuyApr 2018Stifel NicolausDowngradesBuyHoldView More Analyst Ratings for INTC  View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaAnalyst: Bitmain's New Ethereum Mining Chip Could Spell A Little Bit Of Trouble For AMD And NvidiaHow Intel Might Be Affected If It Loses Apple As A CustomerBank Of America Adds Nvidia To Top Stock List After Latest Gaming Checks© 2018 Benzinga.com.

But the affair that put him in hot water was over before he took over as CEO, the Wall Street Journal reported.The relationship was with a woman who still works at Intel and started about a decade ago, sources told the Journal. She was reportedly a middle manager at the start of the relationship and didn't work closely with Krzanich. Krzanich, whose wife Brandee previously worked at Intel as a process engineer, became CEO in 2013.The affair reportedly ended in 2013, before he became CEO. The policy he's accused of violating, which prohibits managers from having sexual and romantic relationships with direct and indirect reports, was put in place in 2011.Before the policy was implemented, Intel had multiple highly-visible office relationships. Krzanich's predecessor, the late Paul Otellini, met his wife Sandy at the company. She was a lawyer at Intel until 1995. Krzanich's resignation follows months of high-profile resignations and dismissals across industries as the #MeToo movement sheds light on inappropriate workplace behavior exhibited by men in power. Though the events are reportedly years old, Krzanich's resignation was triggered when an employee mentioned the past relationship to a colleague, who then reported it to Intel's general counsel on June 14, according to the Journal. Outside of the affair, Krzanich's last year as CEO was marred by the  Spectre and Meltdown chip security flaw as well as his $24 million stock sell off before Intel publicly disclosed the flaw.NOW WATCH: What having a dog does to your brain and bodySee Also:An anti-Trump movement is calling for the boycott of these 24 retailersHere's the salary of every governor in the United StatesDisappointing photos show what cruise ships actually look like in real lifeSEE ALSO: Salesforce donates $1.5 million to fight the San Francisco homelessness problem — and CEO Marc Benioff is matching itTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.There is a reason this stock is down so much, but I think the risk versus reward is worthwhile in this investment.A recent study from the career experts Zety says that 40% of respondents fear retirement more than death.

Ownership structure has been found to have an impact on shareholder returns in both short- and long-term. Since the same amount of capital coming from an activist institution and a passive mutual fund has different implications on corporate governance, it is a useful exercise to deconstruct IP’s shareholder registry.  Check out our latest analysis for International Paper  With an institutional ownership of 85.79%, IP can face volatile stock price movements if institutions execute block trades on the open market, more so, when there are relatively small amounts of shares available on the market to trade These moves, at least in the short-term, are generally observed in an institutional ownership mix comprising of active stock pickers, in particular levered hedge funds, which can cause large price swings. For shareholders in IP, sharp price movements may not be a major concern as active hedge funds hold a relatively small stake in the company. Although this doesn’t necessarily lead to high short-term volatility, we should dig deeper into IP’s ownership structure to find how the remaining owner types can affect its investment profile.I find insiders are an important group of stakeholders, who are directly involved in making key decisions related to the use of capital. In essence, insider ownership is more about the alignment of shareholders’ interests with the management. IP insiders may only hold a a minor stake in the company, but this is a relatively significant holding given it is a large-cap stock. A higher level of insider ownership has been linked to management executing on high-returning projects instead of expansion projects for the sake of apparent growth. In addition to this, it may be interesting to look at insider buying and selling activities. Keep in mind that buying may be sign of upbeat future expectations, but selling doesn’t necessarily mean the opposite as the insiders might just be doing it out of their personal financial needs.A substantial ownership of 12.72% in IP is held by the general public. This level of ownership gives retail investors the power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and potential acquisitions. This is a positive sign for an investor who wants to be involved in key decision-making of the company.Another important group of owners for potential investors in IP are private companies that hold a stake of 1.21% in IP. These are companies that are mainly invested due to their strategic interests or are incentivized by reaping capital gains on investments their shareholdings. However, an ownership of this size may be relatively insignificant, meaning that these shareholders may not have the potential to influence IP’s business strategy. Thus, investors not need worry too much about the consequences of these holdings.The company’s high institutional ownership makes margin of safety a very important consideration to existing investors since long bull and bear trends often emerge when these big-ticket investors see a change in long-term potential of the company. This will enable shareholders to comfortably invest in the company while avoid getting trapped in a sustained sell-off that is often observed in stocks with this level of institutional participation. However, if you are building an investment case for IP, ownership structure alone should not dictate your decision to buy or sell the stock. Rather, you should be examining fundamental factors such as International Paper’s past track record and financial health. I highly recommend you to complete your research by taking a look at the following:Future Outlook: What are well-informed industry analysts predicting for IP’s future growth? Take a look at our free research report of analyst consensus for IP’s outlook.Past Track Record: Has IP been consistently performing well irrespective of the ups and downs in the market?

Ownership structure has been found to have an impact on shareholder returns in both short- and long-term. Since the same amount of capital coming from an activist institution and a passive mutual fund has different implications on corporate governance, it is a useful exercise to deconstruct IP’s shareholder registry.  Check out our latest analysis for International Paper  With an institutional ownership of 85.79%, IP can face volatile stock price movements if institutions execute block trades on the open market, more so, when there are relatively small amounts of shares available on the market to trade These moves, at least in the short-term, are generally observed in an institutional ownership mix comprising of active stock pickers, in particular levered hedge funds, which can cause large price swings. For shareholders in IP, sharp price movements may not be a major concern as active hedge funds hold a relatively small stake in the company. Although this doesn’t necessarily lead to high short-term volatility, we should dig deeper into IP’s ownership structure to find how the remaining owner types can affect its investment profile.I find insiders are an important group of stakeholders, who are directly involved in making key decisions related to the use of capital. In essence, insider ownership is more about the alignment of shareholders’ interests with the management. IP insiders may only hold a a minor stake in the company, but this is a relatively significant holding given it is a large-cap stock. A higher level of insider ownership has been linked to management executing on high-returning projects instead of expansion projects for the sake of apparent growth. In addition to this, it may be interesting to look at insider buying and selling activities. Keep in mind that buying may be sign of upbeat future expectations, but selling doesn’t necessarily mean the opposite as the insiders might just be doing it out of their personal financial needs.A substantial ownership of 12.72% in IP is held by the general public. This level of ownership gives retail investors the power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and potential acquisitions. This is a positive sign for an investor who wants to be involved in key decision-making of the company.Another important group of owners for potential investors in IP are private companies that hold a stake of 1.21% in IP. These are companies that are mainly invested due to their strategic interests or are incentivized by reaping capital gains on investments their shareholdings. However, an ownership of this size may be relatively insignificant, meaning that these shareholders may not have the potential to influence IP’s business strategy. Thus, investors not need worry too much about the consequences of these holdings.The company’s high institutional ownership makes margin of safety a very important consideration to existing investors since long bull and bear trends often emerge when these big-ticket investors see a change in long-term potential of the company. This will enable shareholders to comfortably invest in the company while avoid getting trapped in a sustained sell-off that is often observed in stocks with this level of institutional participation. However, if you are building an investment case for IP, ownership structure alone should not dictate your decision to buy or sell the stock. Rather, you should be examining fundamental factors such as International Paper’s past track record and financial health. I highly recommend you to complete your research by taking a look at the following:Future Outlook: What are well-informed industry analysts predicting for IP’s future growth? Take a look at our free research report of analyst consensus for IP’s outlook.Past Track Record: Has IP been consistently performing well irrespective of the ups and downs in the market?

It was durable when Mary Buffett and David Clark published ""The New Buffettology"" in 2002 and it remains one today.In chapter 11 of their book, the authors took a deeper dip into durable competitive advantages, as well as Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s ability to make the most of them. We may think of durable moats as emerging out of intellectual property or some brilliant, copyrighted insight.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with XTER:PAH3. Click here to check it out. XTER:PAH3 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of XTER:PAH3Peter Lynch Chart of XTER:PAH3Yet, even companies locked into price-competitive businesses can develop durable competitive advantages. The authors provide several examples of the areas where Buffett goes hunting:Regional monopolies: Developing them was something newspapers could do in previous years (but rarely, now). A dominant newspaper would buy out the weaker paper, of weaker papers, giving it a moat. New competitors would find it expensive and time-consuming to establish a foothold, let alone a competitive position (this was before the internet overwhelmed most newspapers).Product specialization: Porsche got out ahead of the price-competitive pack through superior engineering and performance, giving it pricing power other auto manufacturers do not have. Interestingly, the authors noted, Porsche customers want their cars to be expensive and expensive models sell out more quickly than cheaper models.Unlike diamonds, competitive advantages are not necessarily forever. For example, newspapers, as noted above, as well as traditional television networks have lost much ground in the past two decades. However, investors need not panic: such competitive advantages disappear gradually, over the medium to longer term. Some newspapers and most television networks continue to operate profitably, but the pricing power they once held is much diminished.The authors also wanted readers to know that four areas of business are more likely than others to produce durable competitive advantages:Companies with ""repetitive consumer services"" that wear out or are used up quickly and have brand appeal. Think fast foods, for example.Advertising: Companies in this sector sell a service that manufacturers and retailers must continuously use.Businesses selling another type of repetitive consumer services. Think tax preparation, cleaning services and pest control.Low-cost producers of common products that are needed at some point in almost everyone's life: jewelry, furniture and insurance, for example.Repetitive consumer services include fast-food restaurants with brand names: Buffett likes to both own them and to eat in them. The authors say, ""He knows from experience that nothing gets used up faster than fast food. The hungry consumer associates the taste pleasure of these particular foods with these companies' brand names, which equates to many repeat customer visits."" Over the years, his holdings have included McDonald's (MCD) and Yum Brands (YUM), which owns such brands as Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut.It also includes patented prescription drugs and, as the authors noted, the leading manufacturers earned high returns on capital, as well as equity, and have a history of strong earnings growth. In 1993, when health care reform was in the air, drug company prices tanked. Buffett was able to buy Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) for about $13 per share. Eight years later, the stock had climbed to $70 and Buffett came away with an average annual return of some 23% on the initial investment.Other strong contenders in this category include brand name foods such as Kellogg (K) and Campbell Soup (CPB); brand name beverages; brand-name toiletries and house products; and brand name clothing.Advertising businesses: According to the authors, ""Warren found that once businesses begin to advertise, it is almost impossible for them to stop. Competition creates a repetitive need. If a company stops advertising, its competitors will step in and fill the void."" In this area, Buffett has invested in Interpublic Group (IPG) and the Ogilvy Group.Other sectors in this group have seen their durability fade since ""The New Buffettology"" was published in 2002: Television, newspapers, magazine, direct mail and billboard companies.Repetitive consumer services that are consistently needed includes companies such as Service Master (SERV), which provides professional cleaning, and Rollins (ROL) with its pest control businesses. Also in this category are home security businesses that hook up a customer once and then send monthly invoices for potentially forever.It also includes credit card companies and, as we know, Buffett has been a big investor in them. American Express (AXP) gets to charge you a fee for getting the card, high interest rates on unpaid balances and the icing on top is to charge merchants a fee each time the card is used. In the words of the authors, ""Little tolls on millions of transactions add up. Toss in the interest charges and you will soon see why Warren finds these companies so attractive.""Low-cost providers of products and services we all buy at some point in our lives: Think of auto insurance and Geico. There is also Walmart (WMT), which is able to ""earn quasi-monopoly profits by selling cheap and moving a lot of inventory."" The legendary retailer has built its brand on quality, service and low prices. One retailer that Buffett particularly liked, and bought, was the Nebraska Furniture Mart, which can buy in huge quantities and at steeply discounted prices. It, like Walmart, enjoys economies of scale that provide durable competitive advantages.Buffett also bought Borsheim's, a jewelry store in Omaha. It operated in a cheap downtown location and was able to sell expensive jewelry cheaper than competitors such as Tiffany (TIF). It also established a brand presence: Its owner had a reputation for honesty and great deals (low profit margins and higher volume). Ultimately, it became the biggest, single high-end jewelry store in the world.AboutBuffett and Clark are the authors of ""The New Buffettology: The Proven Techniques for Investing Successfully in Changing Markets That Have Made Warren Buffett the World's Most Famous Investor.""(This article is one in a series of chapter-by-chapter reviews.

The company plans to shutter or sell 10 of its 91 production factories worldwide. In all, it is anticipating more than $2 billion in cost cuts by 2021. About $1.5 billion will come from reducing costs within its business. An added $500 million to $550 million will come from the efforts to streamline its manufacturing supply chain and overhead. For years, consumer companies have enjoyed what has been widely considered to be overly optimistic stock prices. Now, the names are grappling with the reality of a new landscape. These companies must find growth to match up with investors' expectations, but are faced with changing shopping habits and competitive pressures. Making matters worse, retailers are cutting prices in a fight for market share. Retailers like Target (TGT) and Costco (COST) need to attract shoppers to their stores rather than having consumers buy their staples online. Meantime, retailers like Walmart (WMT), Aldi and Lidl — all known for low prices — continue to open new stores and increase their influence. Procter & Gamble (PG) on Tuesday acknowledged that discounting aimed at boosting its Gillette razor business had eaten into its sales. As one of the biggest consumer products companies, P&G's prices often set a bar for its competitors. P&G, with its Pampers brand, and Kimberly-Clark, with its Huggies, are fierce competitors in the diaper aisle. Adding to the pressure, Amazon (AMZN) has launched a private-label diaper business. Diapers are a good example of a product shoppers tend to refill on a routine basis. Increasingly, shoppers see this as a category that is more convenient to buy online. Kimberly-Clark is also considering exiting or divesting some of its low-margin businesses concentrated in the consumer tissue segment, which comprise roughly 1 percent of its net sales. Kimberly-Clark would join a number of its consumer peers like Unilever (Euronext Amsterdam: UNA-NL) and Nestle (Swiss Exchange: NESN-CH) that have looked to shed underperforming businesses as scrutiny intensifies. ""The changes we are making will improve our underlying profitability, provide more flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and help us compete even more effectively,"" Chief Executive Officer Thomas Falk said in prepared remarks. Shares of Kimberly-Clark were up less than 1 percent midmorning Tuesday. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Kimberly-Clark reported net income of $1.75 per share, compared with $1.40 one year ago. After excluding items, the company earned $1.57 per share. Net sales climbed 1 percent, to $4.6 billion, while North American sales dropped 2 percent. Analysts expected the company to earn $1.54 per share, on revenue of $4.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Selling prices fell 4 percent in the latest period, Kimberly-Clark said, which consisted of greater promotional activity in most categories. Net sales in fiscal 2018 are expected to increase 1 to 2 percent. More From CNBC Starbucks to boost worker pay and benefits after US lowers corporate taxesEnough with the doom and gloom.

Meantime, retailers like Walmart (WMT), Aldi and Lidl — all known for low prices — continue to open new stores and increase their influence. Procter & Gamble (PG) on Tuesday acknowledged that discounting aimed at boosting its Gillette razor business had eaten into its sales. As one of the biggest consumer products companies, P&G's prices often set a bar for its competitors. P&G, with its Pampers brand, and Kimberly-Clark, with its Huggies, are fierce competitors in the diaper aisle. Adding to the pressure, Amazon (AMZN) has launched a private-label diaper business. Diapers are a good example of a product shoppers tend to refill on a routine basis. Increasingly, shoppers see this as a category that is more convenient to buy online. Kimberly-Clark is also considering exiting or divesting some of its low-margin businesses concentrated in the consumer tissue segment, which comprise roughly 1 percent of its net sales. Kimberly-Clark would join a number of its consumer peers like Unilever (Euronext Amsterdam: UNA-NL) and Nestle (Swiss Exchange: NESN-CH) that have looked to shed underperforming businesses as scrutiny intensifies. ""The changes we are making will improve our underlying profitability, provide more flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and help us compete even more effectively,"" Chief Executive Officer Thomas Falk said in prepared remarks. Shares of Kimberly-Clark were up less than 1 percent midmorning Tuesday. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Kimberly-Clark reported net income of $1.75 per share, compared with $1.40 one year ago. After excluding items, the company earned $1.57 per share. Net sales climbed 1 percent, to $4.6 billion, while North American sales dropped 2 percent. Analysts expected the company to earn $1.54 per share, on revenue of $4.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Selling prices fell 4 percent in the latest period, Kimberly-Clark said, which consisted of greater promotional activity in most categories. Net sales in fiscal 2018 are expected to increase 1 to 2 percent. More From CNBC Starbucks to boost worker pay and benefits after US lowers corporate taxesEnough with the doom and gloom.

At this point, however, both are back on the dividend growth path. A little history will help investors decide which is the better buy.Kinder Morgan's 2016 dividend cut was announced in late 2015. It made the difficult choice to reduce its dividend by a massive 75% so that it could put that cash toward growth projects. Without a question it was the right move for the company, even though income-focused investors were highly displeased.Image source: Getty Images.The problem with the cut is that investors were blindsided by the decision. Why? Because on Oct. 21, management increased the dividend, affirmed its dedication to paying a growing dividend, and announced that it planned to increase the 2016 dividend by as much as 10%. Just 45 days later, on Dec. 4, it announced that it could afford to pay the dividend but that that cash could ""alternatively"" be used to support growth efforts. On Dec. 8, it announced that the dividend would be slashed.There's a trust issue here that investors should keep in the back of their minds.There was a lot of news surrounding Williams Companies in 2016. It had agreed to be bought by Energy Transfer in late 2015 for $37.7 billion. That deal required Williams to call off its purchase of Williams Partners, its controlled limited partnership. Energy Transfer, however, got cold feet and in 2016 it worked very hard to scuttle the deal. Although Williams did its best to see the deal through, including going to court, it couldn't salvage the agreement. Following the news that the Energy Transfer deal was done, Williams cut its dividend so that it could use that cash to support growth at its controlled limited partnership.This was a vastly different situation from what transpired at Kinder Morgan. And, when Williams announced the cut, it stated that the plan was for dividend growth to resume in 2018. Only that goal didn't pan out -- because Williams increased the quarterly dividend by 50% in March 2017, well ahead of time. In 2018 the dividend was increased again and the company finally bought out Williams Partners, essentially getting itself back to where it wanted to be before the botched Energy Transfer deal messed things up.KMI Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YCharts.Although a dividend cut is never a welcome event, the actions Williams decided on during a difficult and complex period look far better in hindsight than the moves Kinder Morgan chose to make. That said, Williams' own role in the Energy Transfer deal shouldn't be ignored -- it didn't have to agree to be acquired and could have walked away from the doomed deal much earlier than it did.At this point Kinder Morgan has plans to increase its dividend by 25% in 2019 and 2020. Driving that growth will be $6.5 billion worth of growth projects that have completion dates through 2020. Although it hit a snag with a major project in Canada that's since been sold, Kinder Morgan looks like it can live up to its dividend growth promise. After all of the dividend hikes, using today's stock price, Kinder's yield will be around 7.5%.Williams, meanwhile, is still doing some portfolio reshaping after its acquisition of Williams Partners. However, it is projecting dividend growth of 10% to 15% in 2019 backed by growth spending of around $2.6 billion. Using today's stock price, that would put Williams' yield at around 7%.Comparing the histories here, Williams comes out looking much better. The slightly higher projected yield at Kinder Morgan isn't enough to give it an edge over Williams in my book. And for that reason, I would pick Williams out of this pair. That said, there are similarly large and financially strong midstream companies that didn't cut their disbursements, including companies like ONEOK and partnerships like Enterprise Products Partners and Magellan Midstream Partners. Before buying either Kinder Morgan or Williams, you should compare them to these other midstream names. There's a good chance you'll find alternatives with better track records. In other words, I like Williams better than Kinder Morgan, but neither one's a better buy than some of the other players in the midstream space.

The word -- coined by best-selling author and trader Nassim Taleb -- refers to things that can actually benefit from chaos over the long-run, instead of remaining the same (robust) or outright breaking (fragile).That's because if and when an economic downturn hits, lots of cash, manageable debt, and strong free cash flows can be used to: (1) buy back a company's shares at a discount, (2) acquire up and coming rivals at low valuations, and (3) bleed out the competition by offering lower pricing in an effort to gain long-term market share.CompanyCashDebtFree Cash FlowBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) (NYSE: BRK-A)$205 billion$102 billion$33 billionApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)$269 billion$97 billion$51 billionAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)$108 billion$4 billion$24 billionMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)$144 billion$76 billion$32 billionTencent (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY)$62 billion$18 billion$14 billionData source: Yahoo! Finance, Tencent IR, Berkshire Hathaway IR. Cash includes short- and long-term investments. All figures rounded to the nearest billion USD.Several companies around the world have strong balance sheets, but only a select few make this list. It is a club of uber-cash-rich organizations so strong any one could act as its own bank, getting deals with very favorable terms from distressed companies, akin to what Warren Buffett did with GE and Goldman Sachs in 2008.Two of this club's members also devote a significant portion of their cash to investing in other publicly traded companies. By identifying great investment opportunities and buying in at favorable prices, this can create enormous value for shareholders.Berkshire is a prime example of this phenomenon. Consider that by owning shares of the company, you are also investing in an organization that owns:9% of Wells Fargo27% of Kraft Heinz3% of fellow balance-sheet-stalwart Apple7% of Bank of America, and9% of Coca-ColaThough Tencent's balance sheet is the least impressive of the group, this approach to asset allocation is a big reason why I included it on the list. The Chinese parent company of the the world's largest gaming outfit and the most popular mobile app -- WeChat -- Tencent has also spread the wealth around with its own investments.The company has a 5% stake in Tesla, a 12% position in Snap, and a 5% stake in Activision Blizzard. Beyond that, according to Bloomberg, Tencent has invested in 19 Chinese ""unicorns"" -- start-ups that are now valued at over $1 billion. That's the most of any firm in the region.Image source: Getty ImagesThe situation is a bit different with Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft, none of which holds splashy positions in publicly traded companies.Alphabet changed its name from Google a few years back to highlight the other ""bets"" that it was taking. These bets include self-driving cars (Waymo), connected devices in the home (Nest), healthcare (Verily), longevity (Calico), and many smaller moonshots (Google[x]). While many of these ventures will probably fail, all it takes is one of them succeeding to significantly move the needle for investors.Microsoft, on the other hand, has used its war chest to make a number of pricey acquisitions -- some which have earned investors' ire (aQuantive) while others have yet to play out (LinkedIn). In the meantime, investors can take heart in knowing that the 1.9% dividend yield offered up is very safe: over the last twelve months, it ate up just 38% of free cash flow.And Apple has famously decided to return its cash from abroad and pay a huge one-time tax bill thanks to the GOP's tax overhaul in late 2017. The company will be paying $38 billion to Uncle Sam, and investing heavily in the United States. It will also be spending $30 billion on capital expenditures stateside over the next five years, $5 billion on an Advanced Manufacturing Fund, and $55 billion on purchases from domestic suppliers and manufacturers.All told, by holding shares in any or all of these five companies, you have impressive downside protection in times of crisis, and the ability to see your companies grow stronger during such times.That's important to remember, because when such times hit, almost all stocks will suffer -- including these five. But the competitive advantages of the underlying companies gives them an outsized chance of getting even stronger. That's why this advantage can only be realized by investors with a long-term mindset. Invest accordingly!

Your first attempt at riding a bike. Your first go at driving a car. But if there's one first that doesn't have to be worrisome, it's filing your taxes for the first time. Here are a few pieces of information that'll help prepare you for the process.If you're new to the world of taxes, you may be inclined to hire a professional to file on your behalf. In fact, an estimated 37% of Americans use tax preparers. But unless your return is particularly complicated, you may be better off saving your money and filing that return yourself. This particularly holds true if you aren't planning to itemize on your tax return.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Working Americans have two choices for filing taxes: taking a standard or itemized deduction. . With the former, you simply deduct $6,350 from your taxable income if you're a single filer, or $12,700 if you're married and filing a joint return. (Note that this is what the standard deduction looks like for the 2017 tax year; the standard deduction has nearly doubled for 2018.) With the latter, you add up all of your various deductions, such as mortgage interest and charitable contributions, in the hopes that they exceed the standard.Of course, just because you're itemizing doesn't mean you won't be capable of doing your own taxes. But if you're a salaried employee taking the standard deduction with no outside sources of income, there's really no reason to waste money on a tax preparer.It used to be the case that filing taxes meant filling out physical forms. But these days, taxpayers have the option to file electronically, and there are plenty of good reasons to go this route. For one thing, you're less likely to make a mistake with an electronic return. Whereas the error rate for paper returns is 21%, it's less than 1% for electronically filed ones.Furthermore, you'll typically get your refund sooner if you file your taxes electronically. The IRS expects to issue most refunds within three weeks this year for electronic returns, but it'll probably take six to eight weeks to get your money back if you file on paper. Not only that, but your refund status will be available almost immediately once you file an electronic return, whereas you'll need to wait on that information if you file on paper.Perhaps the most daunting aspect of filing a tax return is getting audited. But the reality is that less than 1% of tax returns are audited each year, and if you file electronically, your chances of landing on that list are even lower. Keep in mind, however, that you don't need to be rich to get flagged for an audit. In fact, filers who report no income are roughly 10 times as likely to get audited as middle earners.Another thing you should know about getting audited is that there's a good chance it'll happen to you if you lie about your income. Whenever you get a tax document reporting income you earned, the IRS gets a copy as well, and if its system detects a mismatch, your return will get flagged. So if, for example, you're thinking you might hide the fact that you made $800 in freelance income last year, don't. It's not a risk worth taking.Each year, countless taxpayers are appalled to learn that there's a fee for filing taxes. But if you earn less than $66,000, you're in luck, because you can file your tax return for free. Just visit the IRS website for more information on how to go about it.Though the idea of filing a tax return might shake you to your very core, don't be intimidated by what's actually a fairly painless process. Chances are, filing your taxes will take less time and effort than you'd think, and the sooner you start, the less stressed you'll be as the deadline approaches.

Ownership structure has been found to have an impact on shareholder returns in both short- and long-term. Since the same amount of capital coming from an activist institution and a passive mutual fund has different implications on corporate governance, it is a useful exercise to deconstruct A50’s shareholder registry.Check out our latest analysis for RowsleyInstitutional investors are one of the largest group of market participants and their buy-sell decisions on a company’s stock can significantly impact prices, more so, when there are relatively small amounts of shares available on the market to trade. With an institutional ownership of 2.40%, A50 doesn’t seem too exposed to higher volatility resulting from institutional trading. Less covered stocks like A50 used to feature in legendary investor Peter Lynch’s portfolio, which would later be bought up by fast-following institutions as the stock gained more popularity.Insiders form another group of important ownership types as they manage the company’s operations and decide the best use of capital. Insider ownership has been linked to better alignment between management and shareholders. 66.70% ownership of A50 insiders is large enough to make an impact on shareholder returns. In general, this level of insider ownership has negatively affected underperforming (consistently low PE ratio) companies and positively affected the companies that outperform (consistently high PE ratio). It may be interesting to take a look at what company insiders have been doing with their holdings lately. Insider buying may be a sign of upbeat future expectations, however, selling doesn’t necessarily mean the opposite as insiders may be motivated by their personal financial needs.A substantial ownership of 30.89% in A50 is held by the general public. With this size of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in major company policies that affect shareholders returns, including executive remuneration and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to decline an acquisition or merger that may not improve profitability.With a low level of institutional ownership, investors in A50 need not worry about non-fundamental factors such as ownership structure causing large impact on stock prices. However, ownership structure should not be the only focus of your research when constructing an investment thesis around A50. Rather, you should be examining fundamental factors such as the intrinsic valuation, which is a key driver of Rowsley’s share price. I highly recommend you to complete your research by taking a look at the following:1. Financial Health: Is A50’s operations financially sustainable? Balance sheets can be hard to analyze, which is why we’ve done it for you. Check out our financial health checks here.2. Past Track Record: Has A50 been consistently performing well irrespective of the ups and downs in the market?

The most notable wereU.S – China Trade War: One of the main areas of focus for the U.S President has been trade, with imbalances and a ballooning trade deficit an issue for Trump. Enemy number one is and always has been China and there was no mincing of words, with the roll out of tariffs and retaliatory measures hitting the global financial markets hard through the year.During the peak of the rhetoric and ahead of the actual roll out of tariffs, which became sizeable over the year, the Yen hit a year-to-date high ¥104.74 on 23rd March.Reintroduction of sanctions on Iran: The U.S President withdrew from the multi-national nuclear agreement with Iran on 8th May, with crude oil sanctions rolled out on 4th November.Hopes of a pullback in global output saw WTI hit a 2018 high $76.41 before the decision by the U.S administration to approve waivers to sanctions on Iran crude oil exports to 8 countries. Concerns over an oversupply glut saw prices fall to a 2018 low $42.53 on Christmas Eve.Italian General Election: On 1st June, a second populist government took control in Europe, this time of the world’s 8th largest economy, anti-establishment Five Star Movement being joined by the far right League. Market fears eased following the coalition government’s decision to conform with the EU’s budget rules, but only after a period of confrontation.Year-to-date, the FTSEMIB is down 16.15%, with a combination of geopolitical risk and economic woes weighing on Italian stocks.North Korea: From foe to friend: The first ever summit between a U.S President and a North Korean head of state took place on 12th June. An agreement to denuclearise resulted, but it was touch and go ahead of the Summit, with a war of words impacting the markets in the early part of the year.While there was no broad based market rally, the very fact that a North Korean and U.S President have sat face to face is worthy of mention.The NAFTA Rebrand: Trade talks between the U.S, Mexico and Canada could have gone more smoothly, with an eventually morphed version of NAFTA being agreed on 30th September. The year-long negotiations culminated in the U.S – Mexican – Canadian trade agreement (USMCA).In spite of the agreement, a slide in crude oil prices, the rollout of sanctions earlier in the year on aluminum and steel and weaker economic indicators have led to a more cautious Bank of Canada, leaving the Loonie down 8.46% year-to-date against the U.S Dollar. Initial moves saw the Loonie recover to C$1.28 levels, in response to the agreement, before sliding to C$1.36 levels.U.S Mid-Terms: Following the surprising Presidential Election Victory, the Republicans took a step back in the mid-terms, with the loss of the House of Representatives, bringing Trump’s 4-year road plan to an abrupt end, ultimately leading to an end of year government shut down, the U.S President attempting to force the Democrats hand to deliver funding for the ‘Wall.’While there was no mass market panic stemming from the largely anticipated result, the next 2-years will certainly deliver plenty for the markets to consider, the current government shutdown just a taste of things to come.Brexit: After almost 18 months of wrangling and negotiations, on 25th November the EU and Britain came to an agreement on the terms under which Britain will leave the EU in March of next year. Extended negotiations did not come without some significant fallout, members of the Conservative party resigning, with British Prime Minister Theresa May surviving a vote of no confidence. It’s not over yet, with the parliamentary vote on the deal due to take place on 14th January 2019.The Pound Sterling tumbled to a 52-week low $1.2487 in December, having hit a 52-week high $1.4339 back in April, the decision to delay the parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal delivering the Pound’s current year low.The Trump-Powell Flare Up: The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its biggest Christmas Eve fall in history, the sell-off coming off the back of news reports that President Trump was looking to fire FED Chair Powell following the FED’s decision to lift rates at the December meeting.The Dow fell to a 2018 low 21,712.53 before enjoying its largest single day gain ever on the very next trading day on news that Trump does not have the authority to remove the FED Chair.Ghosn Arrest: The biggest name in the auto industry, who headed the Mitsubishi-Nissan-Renault alliance, was arrested on 19th November on reports of under-reporting salaries. The auto industry mogul is accused of under-reporting income by as much as $44m.The news led to Nissan and Mitsubishi shares falling by 6.5% and by 6.9% respectively on the 20th, with Renault’s shares falling by 4.8% on the day.The Facebook Tumble: Facebook saw $120bn of its market cap wiped out in a single day back in July, the largest single day loss in corporate history. The reversal came in response to the Cambridge-Analytica privacy scandal that snowballed, as investors and users discovered the use of social media to influence outcomes of, not only the 2016 U.S Presidential election but also the UK’s EU Referendum.Facebook’s 2018 low $123.02 represented a 43.7% slide from its July high $218.62.HuaWei and the World of Espionage: On 1st December, Huawei CFO and deputy chair Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada, reportedly at the request of the U.S administration, on charges of contravening U.S sanctions on Iran.It has yet to become clear how the arrest will be used in the resumption of trade talks between the U.S and China in early January, but fears of the arrest getting in the way of any progress have weighed since the arrest, with the NASDAQ down by more than 10% in December.The arrest and China’s reactions to the arrest have certainly not helped the Loonie, which is down 2.6% against the U.S Dollar for the current month.U.S – China trade talks will certainly be interesting when you throw in accusations of spying and the banning of Huawei products in a number of markets.Journalist Kashoggi’s murder: On 2nd October, Saudi journalist Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. After some initial denials, the truth came out and Crown Prince MBS was implicated, though the U.S President was willing to let bygones be bygones due to the support given within the region.While not of a material impact to the global financial markets, things could have been far worse for the global equity markets had Trump not made the decision to give MBS a pass.This article was originally posted on FX Empire The Big Events that Shook the Financial Markets in 2018  Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis – In Position to Challenge Major Weekly Resistance Zone at $1285.70 to $1312.30  EUR/USD Price Forecast – EUR/USD Trades Range Bound on Last Trading Session of the Week  E-mini S&P 500 Index (ES) Futures Technical Analysis – Weekly Reversal Bottom Confirmed on Trade Through 2523.00  Forex Daily Outlook – December 31, 2018  Precious Metals Steady on Last Trading Session of the Year Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.A recent study from the career experts Zety says that 40% of respondents fear retirement more than death.

With 2,782 grocery stores under nearly two dozen names in 35 states, Kroger plans to leverage its data, shopper insights and scale to help it remain a leader in the marketplace of the future. According to a study by the Food Marketing Institute, online grocery is expected to account for 20% of all grocery retail by 2022 and reach $100 billion in consumer sales, so Kroger and its competitors are smart to figure out ways to use technology to their advantage.Restock Kroger InitiativeIn the fall of 2017, Kroger unveiled an audacious three-year $9 billion plan called Restock Kroger with the goal to build out its e-commerce, digital and omnichannel businesses and redefine the customer experience. The grocer already delivers 3 billion personalized recommendations each year, but they will enhance the personalization efforts to ""create different experiences for customers."" Not only will shoppers receive useful content digitally, but also ""inspiration"" through product-related content and recipes. The expansion of Kroger's Scan, Bag, Go pilot program that allows shoppers to scan products as they shop with their smartphone is also part of the Restock Kroger initiative. After being tested in 20 stores, it should be unveiled to 400 stores by the end of 2018. Additional investment in Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, machine learning, and artificial intelligence will be made to increase the efficiency of Kroger's operations.Delivery by autonomous vehiclesToday, we can get groceries delivered, but Kroger is testing the delivery of the future—grocery delivery by an autonomous vehicle. Kroger partnered with Nuro, a Silicon Valley company that specializes in autonomous vehicles for delivery, on its pilot program. Customers can use Kroger’s ClickList ordering system and Nuro’s app to place same-day delivery orders, but they will need to be home to retrieve their grocery bags from the vehicle after unlocking the doors with a unique code. No word yet on which cities will be selected to test autonomous delivery, but unmanned delivery is expected to be disruptive for local commerce.Automated warehousesA partnership between Kroger and British online-only grocer Ocado is expected to help Kroger automate its warehouses and use artificial intelligence to bolster its bottom line. Ocado claims to have the world’s most sophisticated automated grocery warehouses and has worked with Uber and Instacart to test delivery options, and it’s this know-how that Kroger aims to leverage with its investment. The companies announced they would open three new warehouses that Ocado will operate followed by another 17 in the next three years. Ocado’s warehouses are run by robots that are powered by machine learning algorithms to navigate around the warehouse and pick products for orders. With this investment and access to Ocado’s technology, Kroger will get products to stores more efficiently.Marketing gets a boost from analyticsKroger’s in-house analytics firm 84.51 deployed Kroger Precision Marketing that uses customer purchase data from Kroger’s 60 million shopper households to launch marketing campaigns across a digital spectrum. This helps enhance personalization for customers, but also allows product manufacturers excellent opportunities to market to their ideal customers on Kroger.com, branded digital media and the MyMagazine Sharing Network.Machine learning84.51 has made it a priority to enable and embed machine learning into Kroger’s operations where a “machine learning machine” can build and deploy a lot of models with very little human intervention in a project called Embedded Machine Learning. With a mission to “enable, empower and engage” machine learning within the organization, this was a sophisticated approach to machine learning with Solution Engineering, Model Development and Model Deployment as three phases to machine learning methodology.Smart shelvesWhen a Kroger customer walks down the aisle with the Kroger app open, sensors identify the shopper and provide personal pricing and highlight products the customer might be interested in via smart shelves technology. Not only do smart shelves help the customer, but it also helps the store monitor inventory to be sure expired products aren't on the shelves or that everything is stocked correctly—and there's a customer experience impact with these as well. This technology has been in the testing phase by Kroger since 2015, so while adoption is slow, the grocer is working to optimize it before it gets deployed.With this commitment to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and smart technology, Kroger seems on the right track to staying competitive for the 4th industrial revolution.Thank you for reading my post.

Using either a handheld scanner provided by the store or a smartphone app, customers scan items from the shelves as they add them to their cart. At checkout, you input your scanner or smartphone into the register and it tallies up your order, making the whole checkout process faster and more efficient than the typical self-checkout lane.Yet whether it's the older technology consumers are familiar with that has them scanning each item at the register, or the newest scan-and-go sort, there's one company that dominates the field and should benefit as more supermarkets adopt it: NCR (NYSE: NCR).According to the market analysts at RBR, self-checkout registers are a massive, global opportunity, with a record 49,000 units shipped worldwide in 2016, and the U.S. alone accounting for more than half. Stores like Target have increased the number of self-checkout lanes per store and added such lanes to stores that didn't previously have them.The global leader by far is NCR, which owns nearly three-quarters of the self-checkout market. While it was able to pad its year-over-year lead by 6% primarily because of the spread of the technology in the U.S., RBR found it was the dominant player in all six regions it examined. The next closest player was Toshiba, with a 9% share, followed by Diebold Nixdorf and Fujitsu at 7% each.As grocers like Kroger make the technology broadly available in hundreds of stores, RBR foresees global self-checkout installations surging 53% over the next five years to 400,000 units. It follows NCR should be able to grab the lion's share of those placements, particularly if its latest machines solve the dreaded ""unexpected item in bagging area"" error.As anyone who's used a self-checkout register knows, one of the biggest holdups in the checkout process is the register misreading the item scanned, which requires intervention from an employee who must manually override the system. Just this month, NCR said its next-generation models will be moving away from weight-based detection to intelligent image scanners that can recognize items placed on the scanner.Such computer-vision technology is what is actually driving the new Amazon Go store, the first of which was just opened to the public. It enables the store to know if you've picked up an item or put it back. Amazon's big splash in groceries could drive even more supermarkets to implement self-checkout technology as a competitive feature.NCR's stock had been beaten down to less than $30 a share, but since mid-November has bounded 30% higher, despite having lowered full-year guidance the month before. It has experienced softness in its ATM business and even self-checkout revenue was down year over year, though that was due to an extremely strong third quarter in 2016 which made for tough comps. It's looking for that business to continue its growth trajectory, and we'll likely see even stronger numbers going forward as this trend toward the cashier-less store intensifies. NCR reports fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Feb. 8.Amazon Go may be the grocery store of the future, but NCR is powering the vast majority of the supermarkets dealing with the consumer of today, and with shares still 25% below recent highs and trading at a fraction of its sales, tomorrow's grocery store may just make NCR a buy today.

The largest employers in America’s biggest cities are a varied bunch, but some companies are even the home to the biggest payroll in multiple burgs.Here’s a look at which companies are the biggest employers in each of the 50 largest cities in America:50 Biggest Employers Across AmericaRankingCityStateCompanyNumber of Employees1New YorkNew YorkJPMorgan Chase & Co29,0002Los AngelesCaliforniaKaiser Permanente36,4683ChicagoIllinoisJPMorgan Chase & Co15,2294HoustonTexasWalmart37,0005PhoenixArizonaWalmart34,0906PhiladelphiaPennsylvaniaComcast Corp.14,5317San AntonioTexasH-E-B22,0008San DiegoCaliforniaQualcomm, Inc.11,8309DallasTexasTexas Instruments10,96110San JoseCaliforniaCisco Systems Inc.14,00011AustinTexasH-E-B12,19812JacksonvilleFloridaBank of America Merrill Lynch8,00013Fort WorthTexasAmerican Airlines25,00014San FranciscoCaliforniaWells Fargo8,19515ColumbusOhioKroger22,82116CharlotteNorth CarolinaWells Fargo24,10017IndianapolisIndianaEli Lilly and Company11,47918SeattleWashingtonBoeing Co.81,91919DenverColoradoUnited Airlines, Inc.5,77720BakersfieldCaliforniaWilliam Bolthouse Farms1,80221El PasoTexasT&T Staffing5,34822BostonMassachusettsState Street Bank & Trust7,50023NashvilleTennesseeHospital Corporation of America (HCA)10,18024DetroitMichiganRock Ventures16,61725PortlandOregonIntel19,30026Oklahoma CityOklahomaHobby Lobby Stores5,10027Las VegasNevadaWynn Las Vegas, LLC8,25028MemphisTennesseeFedEx Corp.30,00029LouisvilleKentuckyUPS22,35430BaltimoreMarylandExelon2,95031MilwaukeeWisconsinGE Healthcare6,00032AlbuquerqueNew MexicoSandia National Labs10,50033TucsonArizonaRaytheon9,60034St. LouisMissouriWells Fargo5,41835SacramentoCaliforniaKaiser Permanente10,51736WichitaKansasSpirit Airlines10,80037Kansas CityMissouriCerner Corp.12,89038AtlantaGeorgiaDelta Air Lines5,34839CincinnatiOhioKroger21,64640MiamiFloridaAmerican Airlines11,03141RaleighNorth CarolinaDuke Energy Progress3,70042AnaheimCaliforniaDisneyland Resort31,00043Virginia BeachVirginiaGEICO2,70044PittsburghPennsylvaniaPNC11,43245OaklandCaliforniaKaiser Permanente12,28746MinneapolisMinnesotaTarget8,20047TulsaOklahomaWalmart8,50048ArlingtonTexasGeneral Motors4,48449New OrleansLouisianaOchsner Health System16,77150TampaFloridaPublix Super Markets7,420As more people opt to do their investing and banking online, one area where the need for physical locations is declining steadily is finance. But you wouldn’t know that by looking at this study.Of the organizations that are the largest employers in more than one of America’s largest 50 cities, two are banks. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is the top employer in both New York and Chicago, and Wells Fargo has the most employees in San Francisco, Charlotte, N.C., and St. Louis.The same is also true of retail stores, with Kroger employing the most people in two Ohio cities — Columbus and Cincinnati. And Walmart, the biggest private employer in America, has the largest payroll for Houston, Phoenix and Tulsa, Okla.Healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente is the largest employer in more than one city in its home state of California.Check Out: Highest- and Lowest-Paying Entry-Level JobsIt’s also notable that some of the famed connections between a specific city and an industry don’t appear to be linked in the same way anymore.For example, the top employer in Detroit isn’t Ford, General Motors or Chrysler — it’s Dan Gilbert’s Rock Ventures. Pittsburgh’s largest employer isn’t a steel firm, but rather, the bank PNC. Milwaukee’s top employer isn’t a brewer — or even a dairy. It’s GE Healthcare. And sunny Los Angeles, home to Hollywood and the supposed center of the entertainment industry, is one of the three cities where Kaiser Permanente is putting the most people to work.So although those better-known industries might have helped define those cities in the public eye, it might be time for people to start updating their perceptions.Click to keep reading about the best and worst cities to score your dream job.More on Businesses7 Companies That Have Reinvested in America Following Trump’s ElectionHow Your Favorite Brands Reinvented Themselves and Made Big Money12 Essential Money Tips for Every Phase of Your Financial LifeMethodology: GOBankingRates analyzed financial data for 50 of America’s largest cities in order to determine the largest private-sector, for-profit employer in each.

Publix Super Markets, Inc. has been one of the 10 largest private companies in the U.S., and those who live in the southern part of the country know very well about the Florida-based grocery store chain. With almost 1,200 stores in the Southeastern U.S., Publix is approaching the centennial of its founding, and some believe that the company might be poised to go public at some point in the not-too-distant future to go up against industry giants such as Kroger.One unusual thing about Publix is that although it's a private company, its employees have access to shares through an employee stock purchase plan. As such, Publix reveals decisions about when to do stock splits. Publix has indeed split its shares on several occasions in the past, and what it's said about its stock price gives a sense of how the company has grown over time. Let's look more closely at Publix Super Markets' stock split history and what it means for those who expect an IPO in the near future.Here are the dates and split ratios for the stock splits that Publix Super Markets' has done in the past:Date of SplitSplit Ratio100 Shares in 1968 Would Now BeFeb. 25, 19694-for-1400 sharesFeb. 25, 198410-for-14,000 sharesJuly 1, 19925-for-120,000 sharesJuly 1, 20065-for-1100,000 sharesData source: Publix investor relations.Publix Super Markets hasn't done a lot of stock splits, but when it does, it doesn't waste time with minor moves. Any longtime employees with half a century of experience under their belts would have seen every single share of Publix stock they owned at the end of 1968 turn into 1,000 shares today.Employees and members of the board of directors are the only people eligible to purchase Publix shares currently, and even for them, access is controlled. Workers can become part of the employee stock purchase plan after being employed for a full year, and there are limits on the amount of stock that employees can purchase based on the length of tenure they have with the supermarket chain.Image source: Publix Super Markets.Moreover, the Publix stock that employees own is subject to substantial restrictions. The purchase must be a long-term investment, and if someone sells shares, there are new limitations put in place thereafter to prevent short-term trading.With respect to stock splits, Publix doesn't look likely to give employees a new split in the near future. The stock has climbed from the low $20s in late 2012 to $41.40 per share at its latest valuation date, but before its 2006 split, Publix allowed the stock to climb above $85 per share. That leaves plenty of time before investors can expect another move from the company.As for going public, there's been speculation for years that Publix might look to tap the capital markets. Yet nothing has ever come from those rumors. The surviving family members of deceased founder George Jenkins still have substantial stakes in the company, but a roughly 2% dividend yield offers plenty of income to help them sustain their finances. Only if the employees or the trustees of the company's 401(k) plan decided that a sale of stock was somehow in the best interest of participants would an IPO be likely to gain traction.With strong competition in the grocery store industry, Publix Super Markets has done a good job of carving out a successful niche in the southeastern corner of the nation. Unless something dramatic happens, employees are the only ones who'll benefit from Publix's next stock split -- even if it happens years into the future.

He wrote that the company had started ""the technical work"" needed to bring more perks to Prime members who shop at Whole Foods.Exciting changes have already rolled out since Amazon scooped up the grocer last June. Some benefits are for Prime members only, while others are available to everyone.Amazon Prime members in seven cities can get free two-hour Whole Foods delivery on orders of at least $35. Image source: Whole Foods.Amazon didn't wait around to bring down the famously high prices at Whole Foods. The day Amazon announced the closure of its Whole Foods acquisition on Thursday, Aug. 24, it simultaneously announced that the grocer would start offering lower prices the following Monday. While some complained that prices weren't cut on enough items at Whole Foods, a number of popular foods, including avocados, salmon, and organic eggs, all saw their prices reduced.But Amazon wasn't done: It followed that up with a second round of price cuts in November. According to Bezos, orders from Amazon Prime members that month helped break Whole Foods' all-time record for the amount of turkeys sold during the Thanksgiving holiday.It was important for Amazon to lower prices at Whole Foods because the grocer had been criticized for its high prices, while Amazon aims to bring quality items to the masses at reasonable prices.In addition, Whole Foods' prices were holding back its growth. While Whole Foods revenue has been increasing since 2012, its revenue growth had decelerated from 15.7% in 2012 to just 1.9% in 2017, according to eMarketer. But Amazon's magic touch is already working; Whole Foods' revenue growth went from 0.6% in the 2017 third quarter to 4.4% in the 2017 fourth quarter. That's likely due to the excitement surrounding the acquisition, as well as the reduced prices.Whole Foods' revenue growth got a boost in the 2017 fourth quarter thanks to Amazon. Source: eMarketer.In February, Amazon started offering Prime members free two-hour delivery from Whole Foods on orders over $35. The service is currently available in only seven U.S. cities, but Amazon said it plans to expand it across the U.S. this year. As an added bonus, Prime members who use the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Card can get 5% back when they shop at Whole Foods.Amazon is successfully luring its 100 million loyal Prime members to do their grocery shopping at Whole Foods. With more Prime benefits on the way, we can expect to see more and more Prime members switching to Whole Foods.Added incentives like reduced prices, 5% back, and -- more recently -- free two-hour delivery also help explain why Whole Foods' revenue shot up 4.4% year over year to $3.65 billion in the fourth quarter.With its Whole Foods purchase, Amazon gained 479 brick-and-mortar locations across the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Amazon immediately made use of them by designating a section in over 100 of the stores as a showroom for its Alexa devices, including the Amazon Echo and the Amazon Dot.Displaying the devices in Whole Foods allows people to try the Alexa products and get comfortable with them before making a purchase. Amazon knows that people may be willing to buy toothpaste on its platform without testing it out, but they're often more wary of making bigger purchases online without seeing the item in person.In the same way, Whole Foods has never had access to an efficient, hugely popular online selling platform like Amazon. You can now buy Whole Foods' private label products, like its 365 Everyday Value line, on Amazon's website. Just as Amazon products are expanding their reach in physical stores, Whole Foods products are expanding their online reach.In another example of integrating Whole Foods into its growing empire, Amazon now allows people to pick up or return Amazon packages at Whole Foods. Customers use the Amazon Lockers that are currently set up in hundreds of Whole Food locations.Amazon aims to weave itself into every aspect of our lives by making things easier for us with convenient and affordable shopping methods. And as much as people might like to resist giving in to a big company that some accuse of becoming a monopoly, not many can resist free two-hour delivery, easy returns, or reasonably priced (ripe) avocados.With these four big changes coming in the first eight months after the deal was sealed, it's easy to see why other grocery players like Walmart, Kroger, and Target have all been scurrying to step up their game so they aren't left behind.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon used to say that Walmart's physical store locations were something Amazon didn't have, and he planned to use them to the company's advantage. But that argument no longer holds up -- Amazon controls 479 brick-and-mortar Whole Foods locations, and it's not afraid to use them.

The closures still need court approval, documents show, but management is planning to shut the locations beginning in early February and running through mid-April. (See below for a complete list of those locations set to close.) ""The reinvention of our brands requires that we make tough decisions about our priorities and focus,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Brandon wrote Tuesday in a memo to customers. ""The actions we are taking are necessary to give us the best chance to emerge from our bankruptcy proceedings as a more viable and competitive company."" The Wayne, New Jersey-based retailer added that a number of its existing locations will be co-branded as Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores. Just four months ago and before the holiday shopping season, Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy protection as its sales were waning and debt was piling up. The toy chain faces increased competition from the likes of Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), and it's struggled meeting consumers' needs online. Toys R Us has said it's focused on improving the in-store and online shopping experience and is also planning to revamp its loyalty program to appeal to more consumers. The president of Toys R Us Canada, Melanie Teed-Murch, said in a separate memo that the 83 locations in Canada won't be impacted by Tuesday's news. In Canada, Toys R Us ""will be taking additional steps to improve the overall customer omnichannel experience with compelling promotions, continued improvements to mobile and digital marketing and enhancements to our baby registry and loyalty programs,"" Teed-Murch explained. Some analysts have already speculated that Target is positioned to be the biggest winner as Toys R Us closes some of its U.S. stores, considering the big-box retailer's proximity to the toy chain's locations. Out of Toys R Us' roughly 880 store fleet in the U.S., 183 stores (including those under the Babies R Us nameplate) have at least one other Toys R Us store within a 15-minute drive, UBS wrote in a note to clients in December. Analysts Arpine Kocharyan and Michael Lasser said they believed the company would close these ""cannibalized"" locations before any others.Here's a list of the Toys R Us stores set to close in the U.S.: Alabama 2600 McFarland Blvd. East, Tuscaloosa AL 335 Summit Blvd., Birmingham AL Arizona 801 W. 32nd Street, Yuma AZ 12801 North Tatum Blvd., Paradise Valley AZ 9139 Indian Bend Rd., Scottsdale AZ 4619 N.

Take a look at these stocks (note: he provides a link to a list of 40 stocks with a free cash flow yield of 10% or higher). Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with SVU. Click here to check it out. SVU 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SVUPeter Lynch Chart of SVUWhat would stop them from returning 10 %+ every year, as opposed to NACCO, OMC etc., stocks that have very high FCF yields, and that you openly like a lot?In other words, how do you look at different FCF Yields and decide: This is a real yield, and this is not?""The number that really matters isn't free cash flow. It's the amount of cash flow available to buy back stock, pay dividends, acquire other businesses, etc. divided by the stock price (so that's your ""free cash flow yield"") plus the annual rate of growth in that cash flow while still making such payments.To simplify, if a stock could have a 5% dividend yield and a 5% growth rate (while still having a 5% dividend yield), it would interest me as much as a stock that just had a 10% dividend yield or just had a 10% growth rate. It's today's payout plus the growth in that payout that matters to me.Doing that kind of math on any of the stocks I buy (at the time I buy them) will get you closer to seeing what I saw in them. So, if I buy a bank with a 4% dividend yield, I think that it could grow 6% a year while paying that 4% yield out. It's usually something like that. I see a clear path to 10%+ type returns even if you end up having to hold the stock for a while.So, how does that relate to your list of stocks with 10% plus free cash flow yields?Well, one issue is that some of the stocks on that list are leveraged. So, you have a supermarket stock like SuperValu (SVU) which has a lot of debt. I wouldn't view that the same way as Village Supermarket (VLGEA) which has an overcapitalized balance sheet (for a supermarket) or Kroger (KR) which actually owns about half of its properties and then has a very nice debt structure of long-term, fixed rate bonds that should lock in a very low real interest rate for a very long time.SuperValu equity might be cheap. But it's risky. The common stock is junior to debt. The company has a lot of debt. That means a lot of financial leverage is being piled on top of a business (supermarkets) with a ton of operational leverage. If same-store sales decline just 2% a year for a few years in a row - you will suddenly become very concerned about whether debt payments will be made and your stock will be safe. Supermarkets do end up in bankruptcy. Like railroads, the reason for this is usually that someone put too much debt on them. Owning a supermarket outright that you bought with 100% cash and where you own the land and the building and so on - that's a really quite safe business. But, then if you are leasing the building and you are making acquisitions using debt - or if you went public having been an LBO in the past....Situations like that are risky. SuperValu is a situation like that. I'd skip it.You mentioned Omnicom and NACCO as being two stocks I spoke about having good enough free cash flow yields. Omnicom is financed largely through ""float"" produced by getting paid by customers before having to make payments on behalf of those customers. Like almost all ad agencies, the traditional Z-Score (which is meant for manufacturing firms) would tell you Omnicom is in financial distress. However, Moody's and companies like that would rate Omnicom bonds as an investment grade type risk. So would I. What you are talking about with Omnicom is that I said previously (in 2017) that if you could buy the stock at about $65 a share - I thought it was cheap and would suggest buying it. I meant that the free cash flow yield - when coupled with the growth rate I'd expect - was adequate. And then, on top of that, I didn't think Omnicom was overleveraged at this point. I wouldn't be so sure about SuperValu. So, I'd cross SuperValu off my list of stocks to analyze based on high free cash flow. But, I'd keep Omnicom on the list.In the case of NACCO (which I own), I knew the stock would have about $5 of net cash per share after the spin-off was completed. The company was basically laying off debt on its spin-off (Hamilton Beach Brands) by having Hamilton Beach pay NACCO a cash dividend right before the spin-off. NACCO is also structured in a way that liabilities are mostly at the unconsolidated subsidiary level and non-recourse to NACoal (the parent of those subsidiaries) and then the liabilities at that level (NACoal) are in turn non-recourse to NACCO. Now, NACCO does have liabilities related to its history as an underground coal mine operator that it will never get rid of. It has environmental and pension type liabilities. That's at the parent company level. And it's a risk. But, overall, I looked at the company and decided it had much better financial strength than something like SuperValu. So, I would consider buying NACCO but wouldn't consider buying SuperValu. This is a judgment call. Other people would say coal is a dying business but supermarkets will be around forever. Investors who think that way would cross NACCO off their list and keep SuperValu on it. That's what makes it a judgment call. From my perspective, NACCO's a lot safer stock than SuperValu. This is because I want to see an unleveraged free cash flow yield plus growth that gets you to 10%+ a year. SuperValu might get you a 10%+ yield and outperform any and all the stocks I'd consider. But, it's going to do that by using leverage. And that's not what I'm looking for.Other stocks on your list of high free cash flow stocks include some industries that are tricky for me to calculate a ""normal"" free cash flow yield. For example, I didn't look at NACCO's last twelve months of free cash flow when considering whether to buy it. What I actually did was take the average of all years from 1991 to the present (so about 25+ years) in terms of real profit per ton of coal mined and then I used the current level of coal production in tons. I then made some other assumptions I considered conservative. For example, I used an estimate for losses from corporate overhead that are probably excessive now that the company has shrunk in size.My point is that I'm looking for ""normal"" free cash flow - not last year's free cash flow. There is an oil refiner on the list of 40 stocks with a free cash flow yield over 10%. The economics of oil refining are such that I can't estimate free cash flow for them. NACCO was easy because they operate under long-term cost plus contracts on behalf of customers where a mine is sited next to a power plant. The economics of what kind of ""spread"" in terms of profit per ton you are going to get is really clear. I've looked at oil refiners and I just can't get comfortable with estimating a normal spread the way I can with a long-term cost plus contract. This is similar to why I might own something like BWX Technologies (BWXT) and not another kind of defense contractor. BWXT is a cost plus monopoly provider of a key system (shipboard nuclear reactors and the associated equipment) for the U.S. Navy. The Navy buys submarines from more than one provider. However, those subs use reactors from only one supplier (BWX Technologies). So, I'd be more comfortable with the lack of competition in the case of BWX Technologies than I would with other defense related businesses.This is a big one. I tend to focus on companies where I believe competition is limited. For example, on my member website, I recently wrote about both Cars.com (CARS) and NIC (EGOV). Honestly, I'd be more likely to spend time researching NIC than Cars.com, because NIC faces limited competition for operating dot gov portals on behalf of U.S. states (it already operates 27 portals and there are only 50 U.S. states). Meanwhile, Cars.com faces publicly traded competitors who are spending 50% to 75% of their annual revenue (you read that right) on advertising. I don't feel comfortable investing in an industry where everyone is desperately trying to achieve scale. Those companies obviously feel the car buying information website market is a winner take all kind of business. Otherwise, they wouldn't spend more on advertising than they actually make in profit. They are spending their way to a loss right now, because they believe they can achieve phenomenal annual growth rates in numbers of visitors to their sites. That's too unsettled an industry for me to invest in.So, I've mentioned SuperValu as an example of one disqualifying trait (high leverage). I've mentioned Western Refining (WNR) as having a business model (operating oil refineries) I find too difficult to predict cyclically normal free cash flow for. And then I just mentioned Cars.com as an example of an industry that is growing too fast, is too competitive, etc. for me to feel comfortable investing in.The easiest way to test whether I'd buy into a high free cash flow yield stock or not is to imagine I'm not buying a stock. Instead, I'm buying a business. Imagine I'm in Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s shoes. Or, rather Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s shoes when Berkshire was much smaller. If I controlled a holding company and had the chance to put 20% of the net worth of the conglomerate into buying all of Omnicom (at $65 a share, like I said) - would I do it?Yes.I would definitely buy all of Omnicom and keep it forever.Would I buy all of NIC?Probably. At the right price, I think I would.What about Cars.com?I just don't understand the competitive landscape well enough.Western Refining?I wouldn't want to be in the business of owning oil refineries. It's just not a business model I can reliably quantify over a full cycle. So, no. I would want to be in the advertising business but not in the refining business.Some of the other stocks mentioned on that high free cash flow yield list are stocks I've looked at. I researched NeuStar extensively. This is now a private company. They had one very good business. They administered the ""North American Numbering Plan"" which is mostly the assigning of telephone numbers in the U.S. (but also Canada and some other smaller countries). They had the contract for about 20 years but lost a re-bid process in 2015. I don't remember exactly when they finally lost the contract (rather than the stock market just knowing they were going to lose it), but that's probably why you saw the free cash flow yield being so high. The market knew they had lost the contract and hammered the stock price accordingly, but the free cash flow associated with the contract was still appearing in the last 12 months of results. They had a very high free cash flow, monopoly type business that was going to disappear. They had taken the proceeds from that and bought or expanded into other things. So, there was still a lot of value left in the company and it went private. But, I analyzed it as a possible investment only on the basis of the North American Numbering Plan. I came to the conclusion there was a real chance they'd lose the contract. They did. So, that's why I never invested in it. The stock was trading at a cheap price if you were sure they'd win the contract again.I wasn't sure. So, I didn't buy the stock.Note the difference here between NeuStar and either NACCO or BWX Technologies. A lot of people think I bought into NACCO or BWX because of the contracts. But, that's not true. Yes, they have contracts. But, I bought in because of the competitive economics that underpin the contracts. The reason a customer of BWX Technologies signs a contract is because BWX Technologies is either the only producer at scale of something like nuclear reactors (in the U.S.) or it is a member of a more oligopolistic type market (like in the case of administering nuclear related sites). The companies doing nuclear-related work for the U.S. government generally have to be both American and historically rooted in Cold War programs (the Manhattan Project in the 1940s, nuclear weapons in the 1950s, nuclear submarines in the 1960s, etc.). This is because interest in nuclear technology among companies peaked from about 1950 to about 1980. Since 1980, this has not been a growth field that others are interested in. And then for national security reasons, countries with nuclear weapons, nuclear powered ships, etc. rely on a provider in their own country. It's true that both the U.S. and Russia have nuclear powered navies and it's also true someplace like China might want to build a lot of ships much like those in the U.S. Navy - but, U.S. companies aren't going to build the reactors for the Chinese government and Chinese companies aren't going to build the reactors for the U.S. Navy. There's a local, historical reason for why the contract would be granted to BWX Technologies. Generally, whoever had the U.S. Navy as a customer in the past is going to be the only company ready to meet its needs in the future.The same sort of thing is true with NACCO. The power plants were built where they were built for a reason. They were designed to be fueled with coal and they were built on top of coal deposits. This is very different from siting a power plant near a railroad and shipping in coal at commodity prices. The mine and the power plant are interdependent. It's true there's a contract. But, the economics would be good even if there wasn't a contract. Ultimately, you are always going to fuel your power plant using the coal from the mine you are sitting next to. The two options are: 1) Close the power plant or 2) Use the locally available coal.The risk with NACCO is that coal power plants close. The risk is not that the coal power plants they are now fueling consider a lower bid from someone else. The economics of the business preclude that. That's why it's not a competitive business they're in. Competition wouldn't make any sense there.Most of the companies on that list of 40 high free cash flow yield stocks don't have that kind of easily understandable moat. There are some dominant companies on the list. For example, GameStop (GME). GameStop dominates the market for video game retailing, especially used video games. There are network effects in that business. And this is not a market others want to enter anymore because they think it's all going digital. That, of course, is the danger. GameStop might become obsolete after everyone has an Xbox or PlayStation hooked up to very fast broadband and is buying a digital copy for direct delivery over that broadband.I've thought about GameStop as a stock. I buy video games myself. And for many years now, I haven't gone to any place like a GameStop to get a game. All my purchases have been either digital or done on Amazon. Now, I tend to be a little faster to adopt some of these technology changes. So, that doesn't mean GameStop will be out of business by this time next year. I had a Kindle as soon as it was released. It took years and years from the time I switched to only reading digitally for half of all author royalties to start coming from e-sales instead of print sales.For example, ""cord cutting"" is something being talked a lot about now. I got rid of cable 6 years ago. So, for the last 6 years I've certainly been cautious about investing in any TV content related business.But, I still research these stocks. I have visited several GameStops and tried to do a little scuttlebutt in regards to that company. I doubt I'll ever own the stock. But, it's something I've spent time researching.And I did some research on MSG Networks (MSGN) as well. The issue with MSG Networks is a combination of whether subscribers are durable in the truly long-term and whether the company has too much in liabilities. They have a long-term contract that depends on subscriber numbers for them to service safely. The issue is that liabilities are fixed while subscribers are variable. If they keep their subscribers, this will be a great stock for the next 15 years. But, if they lose subscribers, this stock could face real financial risks. If they had signed the kind of contract they have now in 1990, I wouldn't be worried. But, cable channels are just changing too much for me to get comfortable with MSG Networks. I don't know what subscriber figures will look like from 2018-2032. And if you don't know that, you don't know the company will always be solvent. The stock might do great. But, I'm not sure the future will be anything like the past. It's too unpredictable.Generally, I'm looking for a company that has what Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) would call a ""moat"" or what GuruFocus would call ""predictability"" or what I would call a lack of competitive pressure - especially in regards to price competition. Yes, I want a high free cash flow yield. But, I want that free cash flow yield to not be at risk from price competition from rivals and I want the company to be able to pass along inflation.On any list of 40 stocks, I'd probably throw out 36 of the 40 names pretty quickly. They just aren't ""predictable"" enough or ""moaty"" enough. What I mean is: they are in industries that are simply too competitive.I always want to invest where I see a lack of competition. That's probably my No.! rule. Go where the competition isn't.Disclosure: Geoff owns NC, CFR, and BWXTListen to Geoff's PodcastThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.Warning!

LW acquired Marvel Packers Pty Ltd (Marvel) — a frozen potato processor in Australia. This operator of frozen potato processing and storage facilities in Hallam, Victoria improves Lamb Weston’s global production capacity by about 50 million pounds.Taking into account this latest buyout, Lamb Weston will own and operate 16 processing facilities internationally, and an additional nine facilities in collaboration with its joint venture partners. This acquisition not only opens up new avenues but also provides an opportunity to tap Australia’s 1.1-billion-pound market.Lamb Weston’s focus on its strategic growth initiatives via constant investments in enhancing capacity, improvement of customer services, innovations and increased limited time offerings is an added positive. It also expects continued robust demand for frozen potato products and a tight production capacity in the current fiscal year.Although management anticipates to face hurdles like a poor potato crop at its European joint venture, Lamb Weston/Meijer, it expects to offset these challenges with solid pricing and cost-saving initiatives as well as opportunities in its North American and export ventures. All said, the company is well positioned to achieve its fiscal 2019 goals. Backed by strong price/mix in the first half of the fiscal, management expects net sales to increase mid-single digits.Furthermore, Lamb Weston’s top line has been gaining from robust price/mix. This is quite evident from the fact that this drove sales across all segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Notably, Lamb Weston’s sales grew on the back of an 8% rise in price/mix.In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained roughly 10% against its industry’s 13.7% decline.3 Stocks to Watch The Chefs' Warehouse CHEF delivered average positive earnings surprise of 54.7% in the trailing four quarters.

If you think about it, casino games themselves are pretty similar whether you're in Iowa or Macau.What differentiates gaming companies today are the resorts they build and where those resorts are located. Put a megaresort on the desolate north end of the Las Vegas Strip, and you might go bankrupt before it's completed (see Echelon, Las Vegas Plaza, and Fontainebleau), but if you're building a multi-billion dollar resort in Macau or Singapore, it's almost impossible to lose money. No company has better locations than Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS), which is why it's one of the most profitable companies in gaming. Here's where the company's money comes from.Image source: Las Vegas Sands.Revenue isn't a great way to measure a gaming company's success, so investors should look at the cash flow coming from gaming resorts. The best measure of cash flow for a gaming company is property EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The biggest investment a gaming company makes is building the resort itself, so once the resort is built, it's appropriate to measure ongoing cash flow, something EBITDA does better than net income.The charts below show where consolidated adjusted-property EBITDA and hold-normalized property EBITDA -- which adjusts for good and bad luck on the casino floor -- comes from for Las Vegas Sands.Image source: Las Vegas Sands investor presentation.You can see that Macau accounts for 59% of hold-normalized (adjusted for ""normal"" luck in a casino) adjusted-property EBITDA, Singapore accounts for 30%, and the U.S. overall accounted for just 11%. The U.S. number will fall to about 8% of total EBITDA once the sale of Sands Bethlehem closes, so Asia is where Las Vegas Sands makes a vast majority of its money.Within the resort, cash flow centers can be very different depending on location. In Las Vegas, Las Vegas Sands generated 29% of revenue on the casino floor in the fourth quarter compared to 34% from hotel rooms, and 20% from food and beverage. In other words, the casino isn't the cash cow in the U.S.In Macau and Asia more broadly, the situation is the exact opposite. The chart below shows that 68% of Macau's department profit contribution comes from the casino. Mass-market tables are the dominant revenue and profit driver for Las Vegas Sands, accounting for over half of profits.Image source: Las Vegas Sands investor presentation.In Singapore, 79% of revenue came from the casino in Q4 2017, so we see similar dependence on gaming across Asia.The dependence on gaming is both the strength and weakness of being in Macau and Singapore because gaming revenue can swing wildly year to year. In 2017, gaming revenue in Macau was up 19.1%, helping gaming stocks, but in 2015 gaming revenue was down 34.3%, causing gaming stocks with exposure to Asia to plunge. That's the volatility gaming investors have to deal with, for better or worse.Over the long term, being exposed to the gaming market in Asia has been fantastic for Las Vegas Sands. As an example, Marina Bay Sands cost $5.5 billion to build in 2009 and generated $1.76 billion in 2017, an astounding 32% of the construction cost in a single year. Venetian Macau cost $2.4 billion in 2007 and generated $1.13 billion last year. Any gaming company would take those returns. By comparison, Venetian and Palazzo Las Vegas cost a combined $3.7 billion to build and generated $391 million in property EBITDA in 2017, or 11% of construction costs.Despite its name, Las Vegas Sands makes most of its money in Asia, and that's why it's a cash cow in the gaming industry. Right now, there's no sign the money will stop flowing anytime soon.

The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Work related to the deal will be performed in Kabul, Afghanistan and is expected to get completed by May 31, 2020. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds for completing the task.What’s Favoring Leidos?Increased contract wins for its cost-effective defense solutions from the Pentagon as well as other U.S. allies have been serving as a primary growth driver for Leidos Holdings. Such contract wins tend to bolster the company’s backlog. Evidently, on Jun 29, 2018, Leidos Holdings’ backlog for its defense business unit stood at $8.32 billion, reflecting an 8.5% increase from 2017 end. Such solid backlog trends indicate impressive revenue growth prospects for the company in quarters ahead.In line with this we may expect the latest contract win to fuel Leidos Holdings’ top-line growth in the coming days.Also, the fiscal 2019 defense budget worth $717 billion that was approved by the U.S. Senate this July reflect solid growth opportunities for defense primes like Leidos holdings.Price Movement    Leidos Holdings’ stock improved about 26.6% in the last year compared with the industry’s rally of 22.7%. The outperformance may have been a result of the favorable budgetary revisions along with solid cash flow growth and strategic restructuring initiatives undertaken by the company.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderLeidos Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings AJRD, Engility Holdings EGL and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.While Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Engility Holdings and Huntington Ingalls carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Aerojet Rocketdyne came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 9.27% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has risen by 30.9% to $1.27 in the past 90 days.Engility Holdings delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 19% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has risen by 18.9% to $2.02 in the past 90 days.Huntington Ingalls Industries came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 9.48% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has risen by 2.17% to $16.98 in the past 90 days.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sales, permits, starts and existing home sales have all witnessed a decelerating growth rate. The slowdown of mortgage application, which is obvious as interest rates have trended higher and refinance business has dissipated, led to the downtrend. The increases in new and existing home sales prices through 2018, together with interest rate hikes have resulted in a halt in housing market recovery. Moreover, labor shortages, trade-driven material price increases and limited approved land availability have muted sentiment around the housing market’s strength and margin sustainability.Notably, homebuilders like PulteGroup, Inc. PHM, Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL, Lennar Corporation LEN, D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI) and KB Home KBH have suffered as a result. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry has collectively declined 34.8% year to date.Nonetheless, homebuilders remain optimistic and believe that the market has taken a natural pause. The industry is expected to witness higher demand, backed by fundamental economic strength and solid job market.Given the current scenario, quality homebuilding stocks could offer a safe haven because of their stability and the fact that these are fundamentally strong enough to withstand the industry woes.Among the industry bellwethers, Lennar and D.R. Horton are the most prominent ones. Both the companies have strong business lines as well as solid prospects, and carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Before drawing a head-to-head comparison between Lennar and D.R. Horton, let’s check out a few key statistics of the companies.What Defines the Housing Giants?With a market cap of $13.5 billion, D.R. Horton offers a diverse line of homes across various price points through a multi-brand platform. Moreover, the company enjoys one of the broadest geographic diversities in the industry and is not dependent on any particular market.D.R. Horton has been fast acquiring homebuilding companies in desirable markets. The recent acquisitions were that of Terramor Homes (one of the leading homebuilders in Raleigh, North Carolina) and Classic Builders (one of the largest homebuilders in Des Moines, IA) this December. Meanwhile, in the fiscal third quarter, the company acquired two small private builders, namely Lexington Homes and Permian Homes. The first buyout was carried out to enter the Spokane, WA market and the other one was intended to bolster its position as the largest builder in the Midland/Odessa market in Texas. Among these, the most notable one is the October 2017 acquisition of 75% stake in Forestar Group, a residential and mixed-use real estate development company. The deal helped D.R. Horton to expand operations in Texas.Conversely, Lennar, with a market cap of $13.4 billion, offers a wide range of homes for first-time, move-up and active adult buyers in 19 states and more than 40 markets across America. While Lennar’s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, its Multi-Family business unit provides diversification as well as complementary long-term growth opportunities.In February, Lennar acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc., creating one of the country’s largest homebuilders in the top U.S. markets.Price PerformanceOngoing housing market headwinds have dealt a massive blow to the share price performance of the collective industry. D.R. Horton and Lennar are not an exception in this regard. D.R. Horton and Lennar have declined 29.6% and 34.9%, respectively, so far this year.That said, when compared with the industry’s collective performance, D.R. Horton have fared better than Lennar.Earnings Growth RateThe ability to consistently boost profit levels defying industry woes is a defining characteristic of the best companies. Analysts expect D.R. Horton’s earnings to grow at a 12.3% rate over the next three to five years. Comparatively, Lennar’s earnings are expected to grow 17.2% over the same time frame. Hence, Lennar’s higher growth rate implies greater potential for capital appreciation.The expected current-year earnings growth rate for D.R.

Horton, in terms of earnings growth expectation, surprise history and valuation.

The industry is equally attractive this year, courtesy of solid economic growth and job market. Consistent job growth, growing interest from first-time homebuyers as well as high homebuilder confidence are adding to the momentum. Reflecting the positives, total earnings for the construction sector are expected to grow 33.4% in 2018 from the same period last year on 12.6% higher revenues.Meanwhile, limited land availability, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are keeping homebuilders from responding to rising demand to some extent. Despite these challenges, notable homebuilders like PulteGroup, Inc. PHM, Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL, Lennar Corporation LEN and D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI have been consistently performing well.Among the industry bellwethers, Lennar and D.R. Horton are the most prominent ones. Despite the companies having strong business lines and solid prospects, Lennar — a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock — appears to be comparatively better as an investment option than the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) D.R. Horton. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Before drawing a head-to-head comparison between Lennar and D.R. Horton, let’s check out a few key statistics of the companies.What Defines the Housing Giants?D.R. Horton, with a market cap of $18.9 billion, offers a diverse line of homes across various price points through a multi-brand platform. Moreover, the company enjoys one of the broadest geographic diversities in the industry and is not dependent on any particular market.D.R. Horton is fast acquiring homebuilding companies in desirable markets. In October 2017, the company acquired a 75% stake in Forestar Group, a residential and mixed-use real estate development company, for $558 million. The deal will help D.R. Horton expand operations in Texas — an area which has been witnessing positive housing momentum of late. It is also expected to contribute around $1 billion to D.R. Horton’s annual revenues over the next five years.With a market cap of $14.4 billion, Lennar offers a wide range of homes for first-time, move-up and active adult buyers. While Lennar’s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, its ancillary businesses like Rialto, Multi-Family provide diversification as well as complementary long-term growth opportunities.In February, Lennar acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc. for $9.3 billion (including debt) which will create one of the country’s top three home builders in 24 of the top 30 U.S. markets.Price PerformanceComing to price performance over the last six months, Lennar has gained 18%, compared with the broader industry’s 13.1%. Meanwhile, D.R. Horton has rallied 20.4% over the period, exceeding both Lennar’s and the broader industry’s performance. Prospects, Estimates Revisions, Earnings HistoryThe ability to consistently boost profit levels defying industry woes is a defining characteristic of the best companies. Analysts expect D.R. Horton to grow earnings at a 10% rate over the next three to five years. Comparatively, Lennar’s earnings are expected to grow 18.3% over the same time frame. Hence, Lennar’s higher growth rate implies greater potential for capital appreciation.For the near term, the expected current-year earnings growth rate for D.R. Horton stands at 30.7% compared with 38.9% for Lennar.Over the past 30 days, Lennar’s earnings estimates for the current year edged up 0.8% to $5.29 per share. Meanwhile, D.R. Horton’s estimates for the current year have increased 0.3% to $3.58.D.R. Horton’s projected sales growth for the current year is 14.8%, better than Lennar’s average of 12.7%.Hence, Lennar is a clear winner in terms of earnings growth expectations.Meanwhile, considering a more comprehensive earnings history, D.R. Horton has delivered positive surprises in all of the trailing four quarters. However, Lennar has surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters. D.R. Horton has a slightly superior average earnings surprise of 5.8% compared with Lennar’s 4.2%.Profitability and ReturnsProfitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company’s business and its growth opportunities. Return on Capital (ROC) of Lennar is 6.90%, while D.R. Horton has a ROC of 10.5%. The interpretation is that D.R. Horton’s business generates a higher return on investment than Lennar’s.Again, Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. ROE for the trailing 12 months for Lennar and D.R. Horton is 12% and 14.8%, respectively. While both the stocks have scored above the industry level of 11.8%, D.R. Horton has an edge here.ValuationBoth the stocks are a little overvalued as is evident from their unfavorable P/E, P/B and P/S ratios compared to the homebuilding industry.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple for Lennar and D.R. Horton are 15.7 and 15.2, respectively, while the industry’s is 14.7. D.R. Horton’s shares look a shade cheaper compared with Lennar.Again, trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B) multiple for Lennar is 1.82, compared with 2.09 for D.R. Horton. The industry’s P/B is 1.79.Trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) multiples for Lennar and D.R. Horton are 1.14 and 1.18, respectively, compared with the industry’s 1.05.Lennar is cheaper of the two stocks on book value and sales basis.VolatilityTo gauge the market risk of a particular stock, investors use beta. Stocks with beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk. Lennar has a beta of 1.31 while D.R. Horton’s beta is 1.20. D.R. Horton’s shares are therefore less volatile than that of Lennar.Bottom LineLennar beats D.R. Horton in terms of earnings growth expectation and valuation, while the latter enjoys an advantage in terms of market cap, revenue expectation and returns.Both the companies remain positive about the overall homebuilding market that will continue to gain on solid demand for homes, favorable job market and strength in economy.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa!

Since then, LMT stock has retreated by 18% through Jul. 5.If ever there was a stock investors should buy on the dip, Lockheed Martin might be a case study you can’t ignore. Here’s why.Lockheed Martin went public in March 1995, a merger between two of America’s largest defense contractors at the time — Lockheed and Martin Marietta — whose combination created an entity with $23 billion in revenue and a market cap more than $10 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLockheed, based in California, moved its headquarters to Martin Marietta’s in Bethesda, Maryland, in what the company calls “a merger of equals.”Under the terms of the deal, Lockheed shareholders received 1.63 shares of the new company for each one held in Lockheed. Martin Marietta shareholders got shares in Lockheed Martin on a one-for-one basis. 10 Billion-Dollar Stocks for Q3 and Beyond The gesture of moving across the country to Martin Marietta’s headquarters is evidence Lockheed executives truly believed it was a merger of equals. Lockheed shareholders have been handsomely rewarded in the 22 years since. For every 100 Lockheed shares owned before the merger, if you held for the entire period, you would have an annualized total return of 11.8%, almost double the S&P 500.I can remember as a young kid flying down to Palm Beach at March break to visit my grandparents on an Eastern Airlines L10-11. At the time, I thought it was the coolest plane going — until Lockheed Martin stopped making them in 1983, exiting the commercial aircraft business.Of course, Lockheed Martin’s carried on and is now run by Marilyn Hewson, a former industrial engineer, who’s worked at the company for more than 35 years.Hewson is one of only 25 women running S&P 500 companies. Recently, I recommended seven women-led S&P 500 companies to own for the long haul. Hewson didn’t make my list, but that had nothing to do with her skills or the quality of LMT stock. It had more to do with my aversion to defense-related companies. Otherwise, she’d have been on my list.In April, LMT stock dropped after the company released its Q1 2018 results. While it beat expectations, investors thought it would up its annual cash flow guidance above $3 billion, its outlook from the previous quarter.“There could be some modest disappointment that the cash guidance has not been raised, but it is early in the year and cash is trickier to predict,” Robert Stallard of Vertical Research stated at the time.From my casual observation, everything about Lockheed Martin’s first quarter report was pristine good.Here’s the rub.Since Lockheed Corporation hooked up with Martin Marietta in 1995, its stock has had three significant corrections of more than 10%. The first was in late 1999, the second in late 2008 and early 2009, and the latest in 2018.Three in 22 years.Its financials and business are both solid as a rock. So the question becomes: how much more downside does LMT stock have?History shows that it doesn’t stay down for very long. We’re in month five of a downturn. I’m no technical analyst, but eventually, investors are going to rotate back into it. It might have another $30 in downside left in it — that’s assuming the economy doesn’t go to heck as a result of the trade war — but long term, its 2.6% yield is safer than most. 3 Reasons to Buy Lockheed Martin Stock on Weakness If you can handle owning a so-called “sin” stock and you like steady dividend payments and capital appreciation, Lockheed Martin ought to be at or near the top of your buy list.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. 20 Red-Hot Tech Stocks to Consider  The ABSOLUTE Best Way to Invest in the Marijuana Boom  The Best Shot You’ll Ever Have at Making 50 TIMES Your Money  4 Developments That Will Fuel the Mega Marijuana Market  Compare Brokers The post Lockheed Martin Stock Is a Case Study for Buying on the Dip appeared first on InvestorPlace.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

LMT recently secured a $289.2-million modification contract for the delivery of 24 M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) launchers and spare parts. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.Work related to the deal will be carried out in Grand Prairie, TX, and is expected to be completed by Jul 1, 2022. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 other procurement and Army funds for completing the task.A Brief Note on HIMARSThe HIMARS is the newest member in the multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) family. It enables troops in engaging and defeating artillery, and air defense concentrations.The rocket system carries a six-pack of GMLRS rockets or one TACMS missile, and is designed to launch the entire MLRS family of munitions. Additionally, it simplifies coalition operations, training, logistics and military coordination.What Favors Lockheed Martin?In recent times, the importance of missile defense systems in the U.S. aerospace-defense market has gained significant traction due to advancements and integration of new tactical features, followed by improved markets for cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, air to air missile, directed energy weapons and anti-satellite weapons. With Lockheed Martin being a prominent missile developer and Pentagon’s largest defense contractor, growing demand for missiles has been resulting in a significantly higher inflow of contracts for the company.This, in turn, boosts the company’s Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) segment’s top line. Evidently the MFC unit recorded strong revenue growth of 16.9% in the second quarter of 2018. We can, thus, expect this businesssegment to generate similar top-line growth in days ahead, based on consistent order flows from Pentagon, like the latest one.Per ASD Media BV, the global Missiles and Missile Defense Systems (MMDS) market value is projected to see a CAGR of 6% to $93 billion by 2027 from 2018. Such growth can be attributed to heavy and frequent investments made by countries like the United States, China, Russia and Israel in the development of next-generation missiles and missile defense systems along with the large scale procurement made by countries like Saudi Arabia, India, Japan and South Korea.These developments and technical advancements will further lead to the increasing demand for missiles, spare parts and technical services, thereby, boosting growth prospects of defense contractors like Lockheed Martin in this market.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about only 10% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 22.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in theaerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings AJRD, Engility Holdings EGL and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.While Aerojet Rocketdyne sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Huntington Ingalls and Engility carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Majority of the work related to the deal will be performed in Manassas, Virginia and Syracuse, NY.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC and is expected to get completed by September 2022.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy); fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 other procurement (Navy); and fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds for completing the task.A Brief Note on LMT's ISIS ProgramThe ISIS program is mainly engaged in providing mission critical, all-weather, visual and electronic search, digital image management, indication, warning, and platform architecture interface capabilities. It revolutionizes Navy submarine surveillance capabilities by integrating digital video and still images from devices on a submarine's exterior, and presenting real-time imagery and analysis on crews' existing control room tactical displays.What Favors Lockheed Martin?In recent times, heightened geo-political tensions looming across the globe and rapid modernization of China’s submarine fleet have compelled the United States to significantly modernize its naval defense. This was evident from the $7.4-billion investment plan to purchase 2 Virginia Class Submarines included in the fiscal 2019 defense budget, which was approved by the U.S. Senate, earlier this June.Lockheed Martin's RMS unit, which manufactures submarine imaging systems, also offers a wide variety of technical expertise, critical mission support and associated spares. Such technical services are important for the effective functioning of the components and interconnected systems, placed within the submarines. Also, submarine combat system experts in the company aid in several system upgrades and technology insertion for U.S. Navy's electro-optical surveillance system designed for several classes of submarines. Such proven expertise in the field of imaging systems services has enabled the company to clinch the latest deal. In line with this, Lockheed Martin is expected to be one of Pentagon's primary choices to award contracts related to submarine imaging systems support.Per Market Research Engine firm, the global submarine market is expected to see a CAGR of 4.86% by 2022 from 2017. Such growth can be attributed to the technology advancements, rising transnational terrorism and replacement of existing fleet of submarines on a global scale. This, in turn, will further lead to the increasing demand for technical and maintenance services along with submarine components and spares, thereby boosting the growth prospects of defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, going ahead.During second-quarter 2018, revenues at Lockheed Martin’s RMS unit increased 4.5% year over year, driven by higher sales for integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs as well as C4ISR programs. Based on the increasing demand for submarines, consistent order flows from Pentagon, like the latest one, are expected to generate similar top-line growth for Lockheed Martin’s RMS unit, in the coming days.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about only 10.2% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 22.3%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings AJRD, Engility Holdings EGL and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.While Aerojet Rocketdyne sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Huntington Ingalls and Engility carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Majority of the work related to the deal will be performed in Manassas, Virginia and Syracuse, NY.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC and is expected to get completed by September 2022.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy); fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 other procurement (Navy); and fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds for completing the task.A Brief Note on LMT's ISIS ProgramThe ISIS program is mainly engaged in providing mission critical, all-weather, visual and electronic search, digital image management, indication, warning, and platform architecture interface capabilities. It revolutionizes Navy submarine surveillance capabilities by integrating digital video and still images from devices on a submarine's exterior, and presenting real-time imagery and analysis on crews' existing control room tactical displays.What Favors Lockheed Martin?In recent times, heightened geo-political tensions looming across the globe and rapid modernization of China’s submarine fleet have compelled the United States to significantly modernize its naval defense. This was evident from the $7.4-billion investment plan to purchase 2 Virginia Class Submarines included in the fiscal 2019 defense budget, which was approved by the U.S. Senate, earlier this June.Lockheed Martin's RMS unit, which manufactures submarine imaging systems, also offers a wide variety of technical expertise, critical mission support and associated spares. Such technical services are important for the effective functioning of the components and interconnected systems, placed within the submarines. Also, submarine combat system experts in the company aid in several system upgrades and technology insertion for U.S. Navy's electro-optical surveillance system designed for several classes of submarines. Such proven expertise in the field of imaging systems services has enabled the company to clinch the latest deal.

LMT recently secured a $631.8-million deal to deliver a variety of Hellfire II missile variants to Netherlands and Japan, under the Foreign Military Sales program. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.Work related to the deal will be executed in Orlando, FL, with an estimated completion date of Sep 30, 2021. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2018 foreign military sales, and other procurement and Army funds for completing the task.A Brief Note on Hellfire II MissilesHellfire II is an air-to-surface and surface-to-surface missile system, an upgraded version of the Longbow Hellfire missiles. The Hellfire missile can be fired from rotary and fixed-wing aircraft, waterborne vessels, and land- based systems at a variety of targets. It also incorporates a semi-active laser guidance system, which provides it with a precision, man-in-the-loop capability.Importance of FMS DealsAs more and more developing nations across the world are increasing their defense budget to strengthen their positions in the global defense space, the United States is witnessing more foreign military sales (FMS) contracts, being the world’s largest exporter of arms. In line with this, being Pentagon’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin is seeing increased number of FMS contracts lately.   Evidently, in the second quarter of 2018, FMS contracts contributed approximately 26% of the company's total revenues. With developing economies like India and Turkey, and recently developed nations like Romania signing more defense deals with the U.S. government, we may expect Lockheed Martin to secure more FMS contracts in coming days.What Favors Lockheed Martin?In recent times, increasing geopolitical tensions across the globe has induced nations, both developed and developing, to expand their military arsenal, with missiles constituting a significant part of it. The company, being one of the major missile makers in the United States, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly-diversified programs and strong order bookings for its  missile variants. This allows the company’s Missiles and Fire Control unit to deliver positive top-line growth.Evidently, in second-quarter 2018, revenues at its Missiles and Fire Control unit increased a solid 16.9% year over year, driven by increased volume on air and missile defense programs, thanks to solid contract inflows for these programs. Given the company’s proven expertise in missile programs, we may expect a consistent order flow for Lockheed Martin from Pentagon. This, in turn, will enable the company’s missile business unit tocontinue to generate similar top-line growth, in coming days.Meanwhile, toward the end of June 2018, the U.S. Senate approved the fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments worth $4.6 billion in Preferred Munitions. In particular, the budget includes an investment plan of $600 million for Lockheed Martin’s Hellfire II missiles. Such budgetary developments should have a favorable impact on Lockheed Martin’s financials, in the days ahead.Looking AheadPer the Markets and Markets research firm, the rocket and missile market is projected to see a CAGR of 4.74%, rising from $55.5 billion in 2017 to $70 billion.  Such growth can be attributed to the increasing geopolitical conflicts, war, and terrorism, significantly driving the demand for rockets and missiles on a global scale. Given this huge opportunity for expansion, frequent contract wins from Pentagon for its various missiles, including thelatest one, will allow Lockheed Martin to further enhance its market share in the aerospace and defense industry.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has improved about only 12% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 24.5%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Raytheon Company RTN, Wesco Aircraft Holdings WAIR and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Raytheon came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.64% in the last four quarters.

To win such a big order, Lockheed lowered its average F-35 cost to $81.6 million. With engine and other incidental costs factored in, flyaway costs were a bit higher. Lockheed's F-35B variant flyaway cost $115.5 million, its F-35C cost $107.7 million, and the F-35A ended up at $89 million. Still, as Lockheed noted at the time, this contract offered the ""lowest per-aircraft price in program history,"" which undoubtedly helped Lockheed seal the deal.Big as that sale was, however, the contract Lockheed just won easily eclipses it.F-35 sales are front and center in the minds of Lockheed Martin investors this month. Image source: Getty Images.In a mammoth deal announced Wednesday, the Pentagon awarded Lockheed a contract to sell 255 new F-35 fighter jets for $22.7 billion -- $89 million per plane averaged across all three models. These will include:64 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing fighters for the U.S. Air Force.26 short takeoff/vertical landing F-35Bs for the U.S. Marine Corps.16 carrier-variant F-35Cs for the U.S. Navy.131 F-35As and 18 F-35 Bs to be delivered to U.S. allies abroad.Why buy so many F-35s, and why buy so many at once? The answer to the first question is that, over the next five or so decades, the U.S. military and its allies abroad plan to buy more than 3,000 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin. This week's contract doesn't cover even one-tenth of total global demand for the stealth fighter jet -- and over time, investors should expect these contracts to get even bigger.As for why the Pentagon decided to commission production of more than 250 planes all in one go, that's because -- as any Costco shopper can tell you -- items are often cheaper when bought in bulk. When Lockheed gets a big order for F-35s, it's able to run its factories at full capacity, negotiate volume discounts from its suppliers, and wring other efficiencies of scale from its manufacturing process. All these factors add up to savings for Lockheed Martin -- savings it can then pass along to its customers.Speaking of savings, though, you may be wondering: If Lockheed Martin charged $89 million for an F-35A two months ago, and if this week's $22.7 billion deal also works out to $89 million per plane, then where are the savings?The answer is a bit complex. For one thing, in the September contract, $89 million referred to the ""F-35A unit price including aircraft, engine, and fee."" That's how a deal that actually averaged ""$81.6 million"" per plane ended up costing the Pentagon $89 million, $107.7 million, and $115.5 million, respectively, for individual F-35 variants.It's probably the devil in the details at work here, again, that explains why a much larger contract -- which should offer even greater production efficiencies and drive prices down further -- is actually resulting in a higher average cost per plane than what we saw in September. Nearly a quarter of the F-35s on order this time around will be pricier B and C variants, raising the average cost across all F-35s on order. That's probably one factor pushing up the average cost.Even more tellingly, the majority of the F-35s being sold in this November order are being sold abroad -- and while Lockheed doesn't highlight this fact, it's generally been the case that F-35s sold abroad through the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales program retail for higher prices than what the Pentagon pays. And that's not necessarily a bad thing for U.S. taxpayers, as it means foreign buyers may be subsidizing cheaper warplanes for us.Whatever the reason for the apparent rise in average cost, the upshot is this: Lockheed Martin just scored a contract worth more than 40% of all the revenue it ordinarily books in a year. That revenue, moreover, will flow through Lockheed Martin's second most profitable business division -- aeronautics, which, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, earns a 10.7% operating profit margin.That makes this a good deal not just for U.S. taxpayers, but for Lockheed Martin shareholders as well.

That puts prices at peak levels, or 1% above where they stood in 2006 before the industry crumbled.The housing boom has helped lift Lowe's (NYSE: LOW). Consumers turned to the big-box home improvement center to purchase appliances, catapulting it into the forefront of the industry, as well as for paint and other household goods.Yet despite the rising tide generally lifting all boats, Lowe's hasn't done nearly as well as it could have. Over the past decade, while Lowe's stock handily outpaced the market indexes with its total return of almost 300% compared to 90% gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500, it only just outpaced the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Index, which rose 268%, and trailed far behind rival Home Depot (NYSE: HD), which surged seven-fold over the time period.LOW Total Return Price data by YCharts.It wasn't a bad performance, but despite some category-leading growth, it still did not enjoy the same level of support as did its rival. Let's take a look at why and whether Lowe's can pick up the slack moving forward.Part of the issue is regional coverage. Lowe's tends to have fewer stores in states with warmer climates, while Home Depot is the reverse, which gives it an edge, as construction activity can occur for longer periods of time.For example, Home Depot has 232 stores in California; Lowe's has less than half that number. Lowe's also has almost 300 stores in Canada while Home Depot has 182.Another primary difference between the two is their targeted customer. Although the professional contractor is key to both businesses, Lowe's tilts more toward the homeowner while Home Depot has greater exposure to the pro market. The latter's executive VP of U.S. stores told analysts last year that although pros make up just 3% of Home Depot's customer base, they spend about $6,500 annually, which represents about 40% of the home improvement center's total revenue.The homeowner, not the professional contractor, has long been Lowe's focus. Image source: Lowe's.Lowe's relies more heavily on big-ticket purchases for its revenue growth, with appliances accounting for 11% of total revenues, making it subject to the vagaries of the consumer spending environment. In contrast, Home Depot generates most of its sales from smaller items that generate repeat purchases, such as indoor garden sales, its largest segment, which make up more than 9% of total sales.Moreover, where Lowe's derives 45% of its annual revenue from just four departments, no one segment accounts for more than 10% of Home Depot's revenue. That makes Lowe's much more susceptible to weakness in discretionary consumer spending, which will see large, expensive purchases put on hold during such times. Home Depot's cumulative, smaller purchases insulates it better from such vagaries.However, over the past two years, Lowe's bought Central Wholesalers, a prominent East Coast maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) distributor, and Maintenance Supply Headquarters, an MRO distributor to the multifamily housing industry. Both acquisitions show that Lowe's is serious about closing the pro gap with its rival, and it's starting to pay off.In 2017, lumber and building materials sales grew 12% as a direct result of increased pro customer demand, and the segment now accounts for 14% of total revenue.But the homeowner is still a key component of its business, which is why fashion fixtures make up 9% of its revenues.Because Home Depot stock has grown so fast over the past decade, the potential for it to continue generating outsized returns for investors is likely diminished. Lowe's, on the other hand, though it has been a laggard in comparison, has made a number of smart moves and acquisitions to position it to capture growth from both the do-it-yourself market as well as the professional market.Although Lowe's and Home Depot are comparably valued by the market at around 23 times trailing earnings and 18 times next year's estimates, and Lowe's is actually expected to grow its earnings somewhat more than its rival, management is only expecting sales to grow 4% this year while operating profits are expected to decline.Investing $20,000 in Lowe's stock today would require the home improvement center to generate returns in excess of 18% annually for the next 23 years to turn that initial investment into $1 million.LOW data by YChartsWhile Lowe's threw a wild card into the mix by hiring J.C. Penney CEO Marvin Ellison to take the helm from retiring Robert Niblock, we'll have to wait and see how that plays out as, from his days at J.C. Penney, he has a reputation as more of a stay-the-course executive rather than a bold-moves type. He did spend 12 years in senior operations roles at Home Depot and served as its executive vice president of U.S. stores, so he is well-versed in the home improvement business, but there may not be enough spark there to turn Lowe's into a major growth engine.

While this makes LOW appear like a stock to avoid or sell if you own it, you might change your mind after I explain the assumptions behind the P/E ratio. In this article, I will break down what the P/E ratio is, how to interpret it and what to watch out for. Check out our latest analysis for Lowe’s CompaniesThe P/E ratio is a popular ratio used in relative valuation since earnings power is a key driver of investment value. It compares a stock’s price per share to the stock’s earnings per share. A more intuitive way of understanding the P/E ratio is to think of it as how much investors are paying for each dollar of the company’s earnings.P/E Calculation for LOWPrice-Earnings Ratio = Price per share ÷ Earnings per shareLOW Price-Earnings Ratio = $85.75 ÷ $4.095 = 20.9xOn its own, the P/E ratio doesn’t tell you much; however, it becomes extremely useful when you compare it with other similar companies. We want to compare the stock’s P/E ratio to the average of companies that have similar characteristics as LOW, such as size and country of operation. A common peer group is companies that exist in the same industry, which is what I use. LOW’s P/E of 20.9x is higher than its industry peers (19.4x), which implies that each dollar of LOW’s earnings is being overvalued by investors. As such, our analysis shows that LOW represents an over-priced stock.However, before you rush out to sell your LOW shares, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on two key assumptions. The first is that our “similar companies” are actually similar to LOW, or else the difference in P/E might be a result of other factors. For example, if you compared lower risk firms with LOW, then investors would naturally value it at a lower price since it is a riskier investment. The second assumption that must hold true is that the stocks we are comparing LOW to are fairly valued by the market. If this is violated, LOW’s P/E may be lower than its peers as they are actually overvalued by investors.You may have already conducted fundamental analysis on the stock as a shareholder, so its current overvaluation could signal a potential selling opportunity to reduce your exposure to LOW. Now that you understand the ins and outs of the PE metric, you should know to bear in mind its limitations before you make an investment decision. Remember that basing your investment decision off one metric alone is certainly not sufficient. There are many things I have not taken into account in this article and the PE ratio is very one-dimensional. If you have not done so already, I urge you to complete your research by taking a look at the following:Future Outlook: What are well-informed industry analysts predicting for LOW’s future growth?

After initially climbing, major benchmarks finished with fairly substantial losses, and some on Wall Street seem to fear that the return of inflationary pressures could finally put the nail in the coffin of the long-lived bull run among U.S. stocks. Bad news from some sectors of the market also weighed on investor sentiment. Lowe's (NYSE: LOW), Frontier Communications (NASDAQ: FTR), and Stratasys (NASDAQ: SSYS) were among the worst performers on the day. Here's why they did so poorly.Shares of Lowe's Companies lost 6% after the home improvement retailer released its fourth-quarter financial results. Lowe's said that net income was down 16% on a 2% drop in revenue, and even though comparable-store sales rose by more than 4%, the retailer sees its growth starting to slow in 2018. The biggest problem for Lowe's remains that it hasn't been able to match the stronger growth figures that its primary rival in the big-box home improvement retail space has managed to put up. That means that Lowe's has to fight a multi-front battle, not only defending its turf from competitors with similar business models but also against innovative companies looking to disrupt the big-box retail model. Until the company figures out how to position itself against those challenges, Lowe's could continue to struggle.Image source: Lowe's Companies.Frontier Communications stock plunged 24% after the telecom company finally pulled the plug on its dividend payout. Frontier said that it would divert the money that would have gone toward paying shareholders back toward paying down some of the debt it has incurred from massive acquisitions over the years. Frontier had already tried reducing its dividend multiple times, including a more than 60% cut last year. Yet with its acquired businesses failing to perform up to expectations, capital has gotten scarce, and Frontier felt that it had no choice but to put an end to the cash drain from dividends. Even with the move, few investors see much hope for a full recovery for the telecom company.Finally, shares of Stratasys gave up more than 16%. The 3D printing specialist released fourth-quarter financial results that included further losses on a slight decline in revenue. Stratasys also said that it expects that revenue growth could continue to languish throughout 2018, with guidance figures that were largely weaker than most had expected. Having broken its streak of satisfying investor expectations, Stratasys will now have to figure out how to get itself back to profitability as quickly as possible before investors begin to lose their remaining confidence in the company.

Three new executive vice president positions have been created in the merchandising, stores and supply chain divisions, respectively.Is the ability to make big moves like this something investors look for in a CEO?“We have taken a fresh look at our organizational structure and are realigning our leadership team to improve our focus, better leverage Lowe’s omni-channel capabilities and deliver increased value for our customers, associates and shareholders,” Ellison said in a statement.Today’s store training focus in online fulfillment and store systems. We have a great group of Associates who are eager to win!! pic.twitter.com/QHJDPFifCu— Marvin Ellison, President & CEO of Lowe’s (@MarvinREllison) July 6, 2018The reorganization is effective immediately, and all other members of the executive team will remain intact.Don’t Miss: The Most Outrageous CEO Salaries and PerksIt will be interesting to see how Ellison’s restructuring impacts Lowe’s already-healthy bottom line. The company realized net sales of $68.6 billion in 2017, up from $65 billion in 2016 and $59.1 billion in 2015.Ellison previously served as the chairman and CEO of J.C. Penney Co. He took the helm of the struggling retailer in November 2014. During his tenure, the company retired $1.4 billion in debt, strengthened its revolving credit facility and boosted its financial position, according to a statement from the retailer.GM’s Profits Are Soaring: 8 Genius Reasons Why From CEO Mary BarraNo stranger to shaking things up, Ellison made several changes to J.C. Penney leadership. In November 2017, the company announced a realignment of its merchandising organization and restructured its senior leadership team in March 2018.A tenured home improvement industry professional, the job at Lowe’s seems like a natural fit for Ellison. He previously spent 12 years in senior-level operations roles at The Home Depot, including executive vice president of U.S. stores. In that position, he led the operations of the company’s nearly 2,000 stores in the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Not everyone can start big, just take a look at these people who went from entry level to CEO.More on BusinessHow This Entrepreneur Turned a Terrible Injury Into 7-Figure SuccessHow to Make Your First Million the Warren Buffett WayFuture Is Gloomy for Retailers as They Cut Jobs and Shutter StoresThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Lowe’s New CEO Is Shaking the Company Up Just a Week InTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

MTW and Phillips 66 PSX.5 Stocks Stealing the Limelight After Broker Rating UpgradesWhile designing their portfolio, an investor may end up making a wrong choice. This can be due to a lack of expertise in identifying outperformers from a plethora of stocks on the market at any point of time.Choice of improper stocks can adversely impact investors’ returns, thereby ruining the very objective of investing their hard-earned money in the highly unpredictable stock market. In a bid to avoid such a scenario, investors, more often than not rely on guidance from proper channels.Broker Advice – The SaviorIn the field of investing, brokers are deemed to be experts, equipped with thorough knowledge. Brokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors. They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations.  Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding on their course of action (buy, sell or hold) on a particular stock.Be Guided by Earnings Estimate RevisionsSince brokers indulge in meticulous research, the question of their actions being arbitrary/out of the blue does not arise. The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. In fact, a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa.Given the expertise of brokers in investment matters, it is natural for investors to believe that there is a solid reason/logic behind brokers improving their recommendation on a particular stock. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.To take care of the earnings performance, we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Revenues Performance – A Key PointerAccording to many market watchers, a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance, especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel (which will hurt travel-focused companies). Therefore, one must take the top-line performance into consideration as well while formulating a winning strategy. We have included in our screen the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks.com at: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/308202/5-stocks-stealing-the-limelight-after-broker-rating-upgradesDisclosure: Officers, directors and/or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and/or hold long and/or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material.

From August 2010 through October 2017, she was executive vice president, general counsel and secretary for Hyatt Hotels Corp., based in Chicago. Both Marriott and Hyatt are global hospitality companies. Reiss graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. Prior to joining Hyatt, she worked at Marriott for 10 years as a hotel development lawyer. Earlier, she worked at Counts & Kanne in Washington, D.C., and was an associate general counsel at the Miami Herald Publishing Co. She started her legal career at Thomson, Muraro, Razook & Hart in Miami. “I love the fact that I learn something new every day,” she said when asked about what she enjoys about her role. “There is no boring day as the general counsel of a global hospitality company. And although I’m originally from the East Coast, I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Chicago—great cultural scene, great food scene and a wonderful civic sensibility that Hyatt and I are plugged in to. And I’ve been lucky to be in Chicago for two Blackhawks Stanley Cups and the Cubs’ historic World Series win.” Marriott operates, franchises and licenses more than 6,400 properties in 126 countries and territories. Hyatt operates, franchises and licenses 739 properties in 57 countries. LEGAL TEAM: The Hyatt legal department is made up of some 35 attorneys and 16 legal managers and directors, as well as administrative assistants and other support staff. It is generally divided into four practice groups: real estate development and corporate transactions, operations (including hotel operations, labor and employment, intellectual property, and information technology), litigation and compliance and governance. “Most professionals have general areas of expertise, although the nature of the work demands collaboration with colleagues in the department and throughout the company, and a willingness to dive into new areas and develop new expertise as needed,” Reiss said. “At Hyatt, I oversaw our risk management team, as well as our corporate transactions team. The risk management team places the company’s lines of insurance for owned and managed hotels worldwide and is responsible for overseeing Hyatt’s captive insurance company. The corporate transactions team takes the commercial lead in implementing and managing asset and capital transactions, including management of joint venture interests, modifications to management and franchise agreements in connection with sales of hotels and otherwise, and work-outs, restructurings, and bankruptcies,” she said. “As corporate secretary, I had a direct reporting relationship to the board of directors and worked with the board on both substantive and administrative matters. The legal department handles as much of the work as we can in-house. Because of our intimate knowledge of the business and our relationships with our clients on the business side, there is great efficiency and efficacy in handling matters in-house.” OUTSIDE COUNSEL: Hyatt typically uses outside counsel for matters requiring “specialized expertise and/or as a ‘safety valve’ for overflow work,” Reiss said. “Hyatt lawyers remain engaged on every matter and are the primary point of contact for outside counsel.” TYPICAL DAY: “A typical day is one in which priorities shift constantly and for every matter crossed off the to-do list, two items are added,” Reiss said. “I have been fortunate to have the help of a fabulous assistant who is a master at juggling my calendar and making sure I am available to my colleagues in senior management and members of my legal team as needed.” At Hyatt, much of her business travel involved visiting teams and business clients in places like Zurich, Hong Kong, Beijing and Delhi, and visiting many of the hotels. PERSONAL: “My husband is a journalist. My son is a design engineer and my daughter graduated from law school last spring and is currently doing the first of two federal clerkships,” Reiss said. LAST BOOK READ: “Anything Is Possible” by Elizabeth Strout and “A Gentleman in Moscow” by Amor Towles. PRIORITIES AS GENERAL COUNSEL: “The health, well-being (psychic and intellectual) and development of my team,” she said. “And ensuring that the legal department is seen as a partner to the business rather than an obstacle.”Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

Baker(Reuters) - Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp (VAC.N), a U.S. provider of vacation timeshare properties, is in advanced discussions to merge with peer ILG Inc (ILG.O), according to people familiar with the matter.The deal would bring together two of the biggest vacation ownership companies, with brands including Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Westin, Hyatt and Sheraton. The combined company would have more scale to compete other hotel-branded rivals, including Hilton Grand Vacations Inc (HGV.N) and Bluegreen Vacations Corp (BXG.N).ILG views Marriott's Vacations' offer as the best it has received so far, and is engaged in negotiations to try to clinch a deal by the end of the month, the sources said. The talks could still end without any agreement, the sources added.The exact merger structure that Marriott Vacations and ILG are negotiating could not be learned.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Marriott Vacations and ILG did not respond to requests for comment.ILG also explored a merger with Apollo Global Management LLC's (APO.N) Diamond Resorts International Inc, sources said last month. Talks between ILG and Diamond Resorts have now ended, according to the sources.ILG shares rose 7 percent to $33.25 on the news, giving the company a market capitalisation of $4.1 billion. Marriott Vacations shares rose 5 percent to $135.00, giving the company a market capitalisation of $3.6 billion.The deal negotiations come as the timeshare industry seeks to improve occupancy rates and shed its reputation of locking customers into complex contracts they do not understand, in the hope of becoming a more popular alternative for many U.S. vacationers.Based in Miami, ILG is the exclusive global licensee for the Hyatt, Westin and Sheraton vacation ownership brands. The company managed approximately 250 resorts as of the end of December, and had more than 2 million members through its various membership and exchange programs.In 2016, ILG acquired Vistana Signature Experiences, the timeshare business of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc, for more than $1 billion in cash and stock.In January, activist hedge fund FrontFour Capital Group LLC said it had nominated four candidates for election to ILG's board, accusing the company of refusing to engage in constructive talks about its strategy. ILG has disputed that it has not sought to engage with FrontFour, and said in February that its board of directors had formed a strategic review committee to consider a deal with other companies.Marriott Vacations spun out of Marriott International Inc (MAR.O). Its portfolio consisted of more than 65 properties in the United States and nine other countries and territories as of the end of December.Marriott Vacations also approached ILG last year, sources said at the time, but the companies could not agree terms.(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B.

Aztec managing director Boaz Ashbel in Miami secured the loan, which covers 70 percent of the $60 million construction cost, on behalf of hotel developer, owner and manager Concord Hospitality Enterprises Co. Florida Community Bank was the lender in the deal that closed May 15. The 208-room hotel will be at 201 N. Flagler Drive overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway. It will be next to a 435,000-square-foot mixed-use project being built by the master developer, Navarro Lowrey Properties Inc., on the old three-acre City Hall property. The larger project will include 250 residential units, more than 30,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, a parking garage and a park. Ashbel secured the loan even though the availability of hotel construction financing is in decline. ""Construction financing for hotels is very challenging, very hard to come by because you have very few lenders who feel comfortable with it,"" Ashbel said. In this case, Concord's track record was a key factor. Concord is a hotel developer, owner and manager with properties across the U.S. and Canada. Its hotels in South Florida include the Hyatt Centric South Beach Miami at 1600 Collins Ave., Hyatt Centric Brickell Miami at 1102 Brickell Bay Drive and Hyatt Place Miami Airport-East at 3549 NW Le Jeune Road, according to its website. But it wasn't just Concord's good standing that aided the deal. Downtown West Palm Beach, traditionally quieter on the real estate front than downtown Miami and Fort Lauderdale, has been growing, Ashbel said. ""West Palm Beach overall as a downtown market has shown a tremendous amount of growth,"" he said. ""It's a market that is still growing ... so that made it a little bit easier."" In the office market, downtown West Palm Beach in the first quarter had a lease rate of $44.83 per square foot, the same as Palm Beach County's central business district and lower than that of only Palm Beach, where the lease rate was $65.27, according to Avison Young. Some of the significant transactions there this year include Aventura-based real estate firm Triarch Capital Group LLC's $22.5 million purchase of The Forum, two office buildings at ​1655 and 1665 Palm Beach Lakes Blvd. The retail market in the city also has strengthened with an 8.4 percent increase in the average asking rent, according to Marcus & Millichap. The Brightline station at 501 Evernia St. in downtown West Palm Beach also is expected to encourage more growth. ""It's a combination of factors that are making West Palm Beach quite attractive and exciting,"" Ashbel said, speaking generally about the market and not about deal specifics. Marriott's Autograph Collection is a high-end brand that usually has 4 to 4.5 stars, according to Ashbel. This hotel expected to open in fall 2019 will have more than 4,000 square feet of meeting space, a gym, restaurant and rooftop swimming pool and lounge.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

MLM is likely to benefit from ongoing acquisitions & divestitures, and higher demand in public sector construction. However, higher labor, freight and material costs, as well as a constrained mortgage environment remain concerns for the company.Driving FactorsMartin Marietta is one of the leading suppliers of construction aggregates in the United States. The company has a vast network of aggregate quarries and distribution centers throughout the United States.Martin Marietta completed more than 85 smaller acquisitions since its Initial Public Offering in 1994 through 2017, which strengthened its position in the Aggregates business. In April 2018, Martin Marietta acquired Bluegrass Materials Company, which bolstered the high-growth regions of Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic.Along with acquisitions, the company has been actively divesting various underperforming operations since 2001. Recently, Martin Marietta disposed its heritage Forsyth aggregates quarry, north of Atlanta, Georgia, and the legacy Bluegrass Beaver Creek aggregates quarry in western Maryland.Meanwhile, the company is experiencing robust the public infrastructure market that accounted for approximately 40% of the company’s second quarter of 2018 aggregate volume. Shipments (volume) in the aggregates product line increased 11.3% on 3.5% pricing growth in the second quarter, suggesting an overall construction recovery.Moreover, the continued higher aggregate shipments are expected to increase the company’s profitability in the near future. Additionally, the outlook for residential construction remains robust, particularly in the core Martin Marietta markets.Factors like positive employment scenario and robust economic fundamentals are driving the sector’s performance.The aforementioned initiatives are driving the company’s results. In second-quarter 2018, its earnings and revenues increased 43.2% and 13.1% year over year, respectively.  Martin Marietta’s shares have increased 1.1%, outperforming its industry growth in the past month. Meanwhile, estimates for the current year have moved up 1.6% over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism surrounding the stock’s earnings prospects.ConcernsMartin Marietta’s businesses are subjected to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding, or severe drought can jeopardize shipments, production, and profitability in all of the company’s markets.Currently, abnormally wet weather conditions in many markets are affecting the pace of construction activity. Geographic mix restricted pricing growth to just 2% in the Southeast Group, as weather and railroad inadequacies hindered its ability to move higher-priced aggregate products by rail in Georgia and Florida distribution yards.Higher costs are likely to pressurize the company’s gross margin and also the bottom line. Higher petroleum coke costs and Kiln outages contributed to a 120-basis point reduction in product gross margin to 36.5% in the cement business.Also, project delays contributed to 6% decrease in hot mixed asphalt shipments in Colorado in its downstream business. Energy and higher equipment rentals have resulted in greater cost-related issues as because the company is anticipating higher volumes in near future.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Martin Marietta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks from the same sector include Continental Building Products, Inc. CBPX, PGT Innovations, Inc. PGTI and NCI Building Systems, Inc. NCS. While Continental Building and PGT Innovations sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), NCI carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In January, the company signed an agreement to take over Kichler Lighting. The acquisition will compliment Masco’s product line. The company is enthusiastic about the prospect of expansion into the fragmented $6-billion U.S. residential lighting industry.Moreover, Masco acquired Mercury Plastics, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2017. Mercury Plastics manufactures water handling systems for appliances and faucets as well as various other plumbing products. The company posted revenues of $45 million in 2017.These acquisitions will prove accretive to Masco’s earnings in 2018 and are expected to create significant shareholder value.Apart from acquisitions, Masco regularly divests less profitable and underperforming businesses to focus on its core areas and accelerate growth. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company divested Moores Furniture Group, its small UK cabinet operation, which was no longer core to its long-term strategy. In the second quarter of 2017, Masco completed the divestiture of its Arrow Fastener business for $126 million.Let’s take a look at other factors that have been working in favor of Masco.Strong Repair/Remodel ActivityIncreased demand for repair/remodel products have been an important revenue generator for Masco. Over 80% of Masco’s revenues are generated through repair/remodel activity. Strong demand for such products across all channels of distribution led to a 4% increase in North American sales in 2017. KraftMaid, the company’s leading repair and remodel brand, came up with a solid performance in retail and dealer channels and delivered mid single-digit growth on increased volumes in 2017. Effective Cost-Saving InitiativesThe company’s cost-saving initiatives help in boosting profit level through business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions. Masco’s gross margin expanded 80 basis points (bps) and operating margin increased 100 bps in 2017.Bottom LineIncreasing demand for new home construction and repair as well as remodeling products bode well for Masco. Cost-saving initiatives, acquisitions & divestitures at regular intervals to accelerate growth are expected to drive profits. Meanwhile, Masco’s shares have gained 21.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 14.1%. Also, the trend in current-year earnings estimate revisions is satisfactory, as it moved 7.5% upward over the past 30 days, signaling analysts’ optimism surrounding the stock. However, a significant portion of Masco’s sales comes from only two customers — Home Depot and Lowe's. Home Depot contributed to 33% of its consolidated net sales in 2017 and Lowe’s, the second largest buyer, generated less than 10% of net sales. Increased concentration toward these customers may not be a favorable mix, as Masco will be liable to lose its sales in case of adverse events.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMasco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.

While the impressive ratio tells us that MA has made significant profits from little equity capital, ROE doesn’t tell us if MA has borrowed debt to make this happen. In this article, we’ll closely examine some factors like financial leverage to evaluate the sustainability of MA’s ROE. View our latest analysis for MastercardReturn on Equity (ROE) is a measure of Mastercard’s profit relative to its shareholders’ equity. For example, if the company invests $1 in the form of equity, it will generate $0.7 in earnings from this. Generally speaking, a higher ROE is preferred; however, there are other factors we must also consider before making any conclusions.Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders EquityROE is measured against cost of equity in order to determine the efficiency of Mastercard’s equity capital deployed. Its cost of equity is 9.45%. This means Mastercard returns enough to cover its own cost of equity, with a buffer of 60.86%. This sustainable practice implies that the company pays less for its capital than what it generates in return. ROE can be broken down into three different ratios: net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. This is called the Dupont Formula:ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverageROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity)ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equityEssentially, profit margin shows how much money the company makes after paying for all its expenses. Asset turnover reveals how much revenue can be generated from Mastercard’s asset base. Finally, financial leverage will be our main focus today. It shows how much of assets are funded by equity and can show how sustainable the company’s capital structure is. Since financial leverage can artificially inflate ROE, we need to look at how much debt Mastercard currently has. Currently the debt-to-equity ratio stands at a balanced 97.41%, which means its above-average ROE is driven by its ability to grow its profit without a significant debt burden.ROE is a simple yet informative ratio, illustrating the various components that each measure the quality of the overall stock. Mastercard’s above-industry ROE is encouraging, and is also in excess of its cost of equity. ROE is not likely to be inflated by excessive debt funding, giving shareholders more conviction in the sustainability of high returns. Although ROE can be a useful metric, it is only a small part of diligent research.For Mastercard, I’ve compiled three fundamental factors you should look at:1.

Doing business globally, large caps tend to have diversified revenue streams and attractive capital returns, making them desirable investments for risk-averse portfolios. However, its financial health remains the key to continued success. This article will examine Mastercard’s financial liquidity and debt levels to get an idea of whether the company can deal with cyclical downturns and maintain funds to accommodate strategic spending for future growth. Remember this is a very top-level look that focuses exclusively on financial health, so I recommend a deeper analysis into MA here. See our latest analysis for MastercardMA’s debt level has been constant at around US$5.42B over the previous year comprising of short- and long-term debt. At this constant level of debt, MA currently has US$7.78B remaining in cash and short-term investments for investing into the business. Moreover, MA has produced cash from operations of US$5.56B during the same period of time, leading to an operating cash to total debt ratio of 102.42%, indicating that MA’s debt is appropriately covered by operating cash. This ratio can also be a sign of operational efficiency as an alternative to return on assets. In MA’s case, it is able to generate 1.02x cash from its debt capital.With current liabilities at US$8.79B, it seems that the business has maintained a safe level of current assets to meet its obligations, with the current ratio last standing at 1.57x. Usually, for IT companies, this is a suitable ratio since there is a bit of a cash buffer without leaving too much capital in a low-return environment.With a debt-to-equity ratio of 97.41%, MA can be considered as an above-average leveraged company. This is not unusual for large-caps since debt tends to be less expensive than equity because interest payments are tax deductible. Consequently, larger-cap organisations tend to enjoy lower cost of capital as a result of easily attained financing, providing an advantage over smaller companies. By measuring how many times MA’s earnings can cover interest payments, we can evaluate whether its level of debt is sustainable or not. A company generating earnings after interest and tax at least three times its net interest payments is considered financially sound. In MA’s case, the ratio of 69.5x suggests that interest is comfortably covered. High interest coverage is seen as a responsible and safe practice, which highlights why most investors believe large-caps such as MA is a safe investment.MA’s high cash coverage means that, although its debt levels are high, the company is able to utilise its borrowings efficiently in order to generate cash flow. This may mean this is an optimal capital structure for the business, given that it is also meeting its short-term commitment. This is only a rough assessment of financial health, and I’m sure MA has company-specific issues impacting its capital structure decisions.

Last week, Match Group announced it had purchased a 51% controlling stake in the dating app Hinge, representing the latest in a streak of moves to shore up its position as the dominant player in online dating globally. Match Group has the right to acquire the remaining shares of Hinge within the next 12 months. Match Group’s dominance in the online dating market and aggressive acquisition strategy raises the question: Why hasn’t the company raised antitrust concerns? Indeed, the Dallas, Texas-based internet company already owns more than 45 dating businesses, with over 25 of those businesses acquired since Match Group was incorporated in 2009, including OkCupid, PlentyofFish, the social platform Twoo, the European online dating service Meetic, and the Japanese dating services developer Eureka. “We’re highly acquisitive, and we’re always talking to companies,” Match Group CEO Mandy Ginsberg told Yahoo Finance during an interview in early June. “I mean like they should: if you want to sell, you should be talking to us.”The company is also embroiled in litigation with dating app, Bumble, which alleges Match Group launched a lawsuit against it in part to help drive down the price of a possible acquisition — a claim Match Group disputes. Last year, Match Group generated almost $1.3 billion in revenues, accounting for roughly one-third of the dating market’s $4 billion in global revenues in 2017, according to Aegis Capital Managing Director Victor Anthony. It’s possible the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has deemed Match Group’s spate of acquisitions over the years insufficient to warrant an antitrust case. Although Match Group commands nearly one-third of the online dating market worldwide, that market share, which was calculated by an independent source in this case, isn’t actually huge, contends Christopher Sagers, a professor at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, who specializes in antitrust law. Amazon, for example, accounted for an estimated 44% of e-commerce sales in 2017 and has yet to face a lawsuit from federal antitrust regulators. “Monopolization is just hard to prove,” Sagers contends. “That’s the main reason the government hasn’t come after Amazon. … There’s a pretty different reason the government hasn’t come after Match Group. While this is a lot of acquisitions, Match Group is still small.” One method the government uses to help determine whether a particular merger has antitrust issues is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, or HHI, which is a common measure for calculating a particular market’s competitiveness, ranging from 0 to 10,000. The higher the HHI, the higher the market share. If there were only one company in a particular market, for instance, that company would have an HHI of 10,000, meaning it had 100% market share and easily constituted a monopoly. It’s unconfirmed, although likely, the government has calculated Match Group’s HHI in the past. However Sagers contends Match Group’s market share isn’t high enough to raise antitrust concerns. Moreover, Match’s share of the dating market may be poised to shrink now that Facebook (FB) is getting into the online dating business.A spokesperson for the FTC declined to comment on whether the FTC has previously examined Match Group’s mergers. There’s another scenario at play here: the government simply may not have connected the dots yet regarding Match Group’s acquisitive streak, simply because it’s virtually impossible for them to keep track of everything going on in the larger business landscape in the U.S. “They have limited resources, and they can’t track every company’s customers,” explains Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and a recognized expert in antitrust law. It’s also worth noting that acquisitions of companies based outside the U.S. with non-U.S. customers also fall outside the purview of the FTC. So for instance, the 2015 acquisition of Eureka falls outside the grasp of the FTC simply because the apps it has developed, including Pairs and Couples, do not have U.S. customers. Scooping up international companies without U.S. customers is a savvy strategy on Match Group’s part: not only does the strategy bolster the company’s dominance in the market, it sidesteps FTC scrutiny — at least in those instances. Regardless, the underlying lesson for a ravenous company like Match Group is clear: tread carefully moving forward.—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business.

They’re both successful internet disruptors focused on facilitating online commerce – Facebook through advertising, PayPal through payments,” analyst Lisa Ellis wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.After a 13-year marriage, eBay (EBAY) and PayPal divorced in 2015. According to Ellis, a new relationship with a major tech, financial or payments company could benefit PayPal greatly. “[It] could create step-function growth in PayPal’s user base, merchant base, geographic footprint, or omni-channel capabilities, and are only possible now that PayPal is free of the constraints of the eBay relationship.”As for Facebook, the tech giant has been under intense scrutiny as a result of misinformation and privacy concerns, and the stock has suffered as a consequence. Shares of Facebook have tanked more than 18% in 2018. Facebook needs a new narrative, and an expanded partnership with PayPal could get the company back in the good graces of investors, according to Ellis.Despite all of the headwinds facing Facebook, Ellis explained that investors are ignoring the company’s e-commerce growth opportunities. “With over 6 million advertisers and 2.6 billion people using at least one of Facebook’s four leading products, they have the potential to develop a world leading eCommerce platform – but, given Facebook’s lack of in-house expertise, need a partner(s) to help,” Ellis argued.Among those four-leading Facebook products is Instagram. The platform has been a force to be reckoned with this year, dethroning Snapchat (SNAP) as the most-used app by teens, according to a survey by Piper Jaffray.Facebook and PayPal have had a partnership since 2016. Facebook users are able to use PayPal to shop on Facebook Messenger and Marketplace; however, Ellis outlined three possible expanded partnership scenarios between PayPal and Facebook.The first option involves the integration of a payment function within WhatsApp. According to Ellis, in order to better compete with rival WeChat, allowing payments on WhatsApp will help drive user engagement. “Even if only 5% of the 1.3B WhatsApp users (whom do not overlap with PayPal) are converted, PayPal would capture 65M new users – a 28% growth in its base,” Ellis said.Secondly, tapping into powerhouse Instagram would potentially be a smart move for PayPal. Instagram has around 1 billion users, and an expanded PayPal partnership with the platform will allow Instagram users to stay engaged on the platform and shop without leaving the app. “If only 5% of 0.8B Instagram users (who do not overlap with PayPal) are converted, PayPal would capture 40M new users – a 17% growth in its base. PayPal would also realize incremental payment processing volume and revenue from processing Instagram transactions.”Lastly, Ellis argues that there could be a more aggressive partnership between PayPal and Facebook’s Marketplace. While currently there is a limited number of people that actually make transactions through Marketplace, an extended partnership with PayPal could help boost that number, according to Ellis.“We believe the conditions are in place for Facebook and PayPal to pursue one or more of these partnership options over the next 6-12 months,” Ellis said.PayPal shares were trading nearly 1% higher at $87.29 as of 12:11 p.m. ET on Thursday.Heidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Bank of America analyst Gregory Francfort says investors can expect more earnings beats from McDonald's over the next two years.According to Francfort, McDonald's is uniquely positioned to continue to gain precious market share from its restaurant competitors. ""We like owning a business that is a low-cost producer with best-in-class unit economics that is reinvesting profit upside back into traffic gains, which MCD appears to be doing,"" Francfort says.[See: 10 Restaurant Stocks to Watch This Earnings Season.]He says McDonald's scale advantages allow the company to use its pricing leverage to push value menu offerings and lure traffic away from smaller restaurants. McDonald's two-for-$4 breakfast promotion in response to soft breakfast sales is a perfect example, and Francfort says he expects breakfast sales to rebound in the second quarter.McDonald's has been offsetting its lower-end Dollar Menu prices by raising them on the menu's premium end. The company said on its earnings call that customers who order off the Dollar Menu tend to buy more items than other customers, and also, many customers are choosing to tack on a single Dollar Menu item to their regular meal order.Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy says the new menu tweaks should help support same-restaurant sales.The ongoing benefit from menu price increases of 2 to 3 percent (to offset value initiatives) and an increase in the number of items per transaction due to its $1-$2-$3 menu should keep U.S. comps in the 3 to 4 percent range for the rest of 2018, Hottovy says.[See: 8 Ways to Satisfy a Craving for Restaurant Stocks.]Bank of America is projecting $7.75 in earnings per share from McDonald's in 2018 and $8.50 in EPS in 2019.""We expect to see momentum in U.S. sales as we progress through the year, and we remain materially above the Street for [earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation] and EPS for 2018 and 2019,"" Francfort says.Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $190 price target for McDonald's. Morningstar has an ""undervalued"" rating and $190 fair value estimate for MCD stock.

Over the last three calendar years, the world's largest burger chain has gifted its stakeholders with an average annual total return of 33%. Bridging the prior year's completion and current-year prospects, the fourth-quarter report is always a critical one for shareholders to pore over. Below, we'll review key themes relevant to both year-end 2017, and the company's overall outlook for this year.Last quarter, McDonald's posted extremely strong global comparable sales, or comps growth of 6%. The company reported positive guest counts in each of its four operating segments: U.S., international lead markets, high-growth markets, and foundational markets. Guest traffic stabilized in 2017 after years of decline, so another quarter of positive comps composed of both pricing increases and positive guest counts will signal strength in the year ahead.Image source: McDonald's Corporation.Investors should pay particularly close attention to the international lead markets segment, which is composed of the five largest markets outside the U.S.: Canada, Australia, the U.K., France, and Germany. This segment generates 40% of McDonald's global operating income, making it equal in size and importance to the U.S. If McDonald's unveils another stellar comps rise, it may well be fueled by the accelerating European economy, thus lifting three out of the five countries in international lead markets.While McDonald's new tiered value menu, launched in January, won't affect fourth-quarter 2017 results, management will most certainly provide some commentary on the first few weeks of its launch. The new menu structure replaces McDonald's ""McPick 2 for $2"" and ""McPick 2 for $5"" offerings, and is meant to be a more permanent value proposition aimed at the organization's core customers.I recently wrote about the rationale behind these price points. Going forward, shareholders should seek to understand the value menu's impact on franchisees. Margins are slim for franchisees at the $1 price point. However, the new configuration is intriguing, as $3 items like the new ""Classic Chicken Sandwich"" bridge the gap between traditional value points and more profitable core burgers and premium sandwiches. Look for management to discuss initial franchisee reception of the tiered price points during the company's post-earnings conference call tomorrow.A favorable dynamic benefiting McDonald's earnings over the past year has been the company's ability to pass on pricing as commodity costs have increased, yet within disciplined increments that don't drive customers away. For example, in the third quarter of 2017, the price of McDonald's basic basket of grocery goods to serve customers in the U.S. increased by 1.5%. The U.S. segment covered this increase by raising menu prices by 2.2% over the same period, but the nudge remained under U.S. domestic food-away-from-home inflation rate of 2.4%. The company typically provides a full-year commodity cost outlook each year, and a projection similar to 2017's 1% total commodity cost inflation tomorrow will bode well for McDonald's earnings in 2018.A long-term growth driver that most excites McDonald's management team is the company's ""Experience of the Future,"" or EOTF. This is basically shorthand for technology improvements within restaurants that allow for easier order customization, as well as an enhanced in-restaurant guest experience through innovations such as self-ordering kiosks. The company began to scale this technology upgrade across the U.S. in 2017. In the current reporting period, investors will learn if McDonald's hit its full-year 2017 target of 2,500 EOTF conversions in the U.S. More importantly, management will probably provide a 2018 conversion target for the remainder of the company's 14,000-plus U.S. locations.Image source: McDonald's Corporation.McDonald's has completed the greater part of a multiyear effort to shift the percentage of franchised restaurants within its system from 80% to 95%. As of the end of the third quarter of last year, franchised restaurants claimed 91% of McDonald's systemwide store count. Compensating for the lower total revenue associated with fewer company-operated restaurants, McDonald's is seeing much higher margins as it collects a greater amount of franchise fees and royalty checks from its operators. Management has set a long-term operating margin target within the mid-40% range.In the first nine months of 2017, the company achieved an operating margin of 36%, after adjusting for both gains and impairments related to the refranchising of company-owned stores. Compare this to 2014, the year before the company started its refranchising push, in which it booked operating margin of 29%.In addition to lower overhead, McDonald's is realizing higher profits from productivity initiatives related to its goal to cut $500 million from general and administrative expenses by the end of this year, as well as lower depreciation expense as company-run locations are removed from the books.So, will 2018 prove to be a breakout year for operating profits? Perhaps not. Spending on technology initiatives, including EOTF and the company's digital loyalty and ordering platforms, may slow profit gains this year. Investors shouldn't be caught unaware if management issues a muted margin growth outlook, or even sets 2018 operating margin even with 2017. Given the various ongoing menu and operational investments the company is currently engaged in, profit expansion may take a few quarters to catch up.

Compensating for the lower total revenue associated with fewer company-operated restaurants, McDonald's is seeing much higher margins as it collects a greater amount of franchise fees and royalty checks from its operators. Management has set a long-term operating margin target within the mid-40% range.In the first nine months of 2017, the company achieved an operating margin of 36%, after adjusting for both gains and impairments related to the refranchising of company-owned stores. Compare this to 2014, the year before the company started its refranchising push, in which it booked operating margin of 29%.In addition to lower overhead, McDonald's is realizing higher profits from productivity initiatives related to its goal to cut $500 million from general and administrative expenses by the end of this year, as well as lower depreciation expense as company-run locations are removed from the books.So, will 2018 prove to be a breakout year for operating profits? Perhaps not. Spending on technology initiatives, including EOTF and the company's digital loyalty and ordering platforms, may slow profit gains this year. Investors shouldn't be caught unaware if management issues a muted margin growth outlook, or even sets 2018 operating margin even with 2017. Given the various ongoing menu and operational investments the company is currently engaged in, profit expansion may take a few quarters to catch up.

During his session, Ozan answered several analysts' questions regarding the company's early experiences with the partnership McDonald's has struck with Uber Technologies' UberEATS food delivery service. It's been approximately a year since ""McDelivery,"" as McDonald's delivery service is formally known, first started teaming up with UberEATS.Ozan relayed that the partnership now delivers to over 5,000 restaurants in the U.S. Roughly 65% to 70% of delivery sales are incremental to McDonald's existing business in participating restaurants. That number has increased from an estimate of 60% when McDonald's first rolled out UberEATS to a smaller sample size of 2,000 restaurants last spring.Image source: McDonald's Corporation.Last summer, I expressed concern that as McDonald's experienced a higher uptake in delivery, the new business might cause some issues with throughput -- that is, the rate at which the company can service sales.Particularly, I worried that delivery orders during peak hours could cause delays in filling orders to walk-in customers. Such lags can be particularly frustrating to in-store customers who can't see the typical visible cues of delay, such as a long line to the cash register.Yet so far, order patterns as McDonald's expands delivery look much as they did within the initial run last year. A full 60% of orders tend to be placed during off-peak hours. The sales are skewing primarily to younger customers. College students, in particular, whether from intense studying or more freewheeling activities, appear to be working up the munchies in the wee hours. I loved Ozan's tactful explanation of this aspect of a new business driver for McDonald's to a roomful of Wall Street analysts:Sixty percent of the orders are in the evening -- evening and late nights, which is really helpful for us from a capacity standpoint, because we've got capacity certainly at dinner and overnight hours. Overnight, as you get closer to college campuses, it's a pretty attractive space to be in. I won't surmise why that is or what they're doing prior to ordering McDonald's, but it's become -- so we know it's a younger demographic, we know it's the time of day that's attractive to us.It should be noted that not only are these orders incremental to McDonald's existing revenue, but to some extent the customers are as well, and they could be converted to core patrons over time. I believe the various initiatives undertaken by CEO Steve Easterbrook to present McDonald's as a legitimate dining option for socially conscious millennials are starting to gain traction. The introduction of fresh, never-frozen beef patties in McDonald's Quarter Pounder and ""Signature Crafted"" burgers this year represents the latest step in this evolution. Removing a younger generation's objections to the company's menu, while enticing this convenience-driven, app-savvy group with delivery, is a shrewd way to add to McDonald's long-term customer base.A fresh, never-frozen beef patty. Image source: McDonald's Corporation.Earlier this month, I discussed a strategy used by McDonald's smaller rival Wendy's (NASDAQ: WEN) to keep individual store volumes robust. Wendy's management achieves this by focusing on the economics of its franchisees as much as it does the dynamics of its systemwide profit and loss. Similarly, partnering with UberEATS has proven to be a crisp decision on McDonald's part that benefits U.S. franchisees, a key group of company stakeholders.The economics of the partnership are straightforward to operators. Franchisees pay a commission fee to UberEATS on each delivery. Thus, these orders carry a lower margin than the typical ticket. But they're still attractive sales to capture, as Ozan explained:But in terms of additional dollars, the fact that 70% incremental is giving them clearly more dollars and our breakeven, if you will, incrementality is substantially below 50%. So there's a lot of room, let's say before we get anywhere close to breakeven from an incrementality standpoint.McDonald's CFO is alluding to a type of profitability study known as cost-volume-profit analysis. To wade through jargon and translate the above, franchisees already cover their fixed operating costs (rent, utilities, insurance, etc.) through their existing sales. So the only costs on incremental delivery orders are variable (primarily food and labor). Thus, these sales have a lower breakeven point, giving the franchisee room to cover UberEATS' commission on each sale.Franchisees love this type of revenue stream because it comes without any additional overhead investment. Between interior and exterior upgrades, investments in kiosk-driven ""Experience of the Future"" ordering technology, and McCafe beverage equipment, McDonald's operators have been required to invest quite a bit of capital over the last few years to increase their annual cash flows. Adding incremental profits to franchisees' bottom lines -- with zero investment on their part -- is reason enough to label McDonald's expanding delivery business a tangible success.

Here are a few things to know about the McDonald’s Archburger.The McDonald’s Archburger is made with fresh beef that hasn’t been frozen.The burger is going through testing at seven locations.Two of these locations have been identified in Plano, Texas, and Tulsa, Okla.McDonald’s has confirmed the test, but isn’t providing any more details about the new burger.The base version of the burger costs $2.19 and comes with cheese, pickles, onions and Arch Sauce.There’s also the Archburger LT, which includes all of the same toppings as the original, plus lettuce and tomato.This version of the burger costs $2.69.An additional version of the sandwich also includes bacon and costs customers $2.89. McDonald’s  tried to launch a similar burger over 20 years ago, called the Arch Deluxe, but it wasn’t well received and was taken off the menu.The meat on the McDonald’s Archburger comes in at 3 ounces, which makes it slightly smaller than the patty found on the company’s Quarter Pounder.The test comes as MCD’s prepares to launch Quarter Pounders made with fresh beef later this year.It may also be a sign that the company is more open to the idea of making all of its burgers with fresh beef as a way to improve its image and drives sales. 12 Best Dividend Stocks for the Next 12 Months You can learn more about the McDonald’s Archburger at these links.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Emerging Market ETFs to Buy for Big Gains in 2018  10 Super Safe Growth Stocks to Buy for Long-Lasting Dividends  8 ETFs to Study for 2018 As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

In its most-recent quarter, the fast-food giant saw comparable-store sales grow by 2.6% in the United States and 4% globally. The chain also posted a 12% increase in earnings per share, and its systemwide total sales were up by 5%.The company has shown that it can manage its business through market changes. It has adapted to increased fast-casual competition in the U.S., and tweaked its menu as well as its value offerings to increase their appeal. CEO Steve Easterrbook explained what's working for his chain in his remarks during the chain's second-quarter earnings release.""We remain focused on delivering the most enjoyable experience for every customer, every visit,"" he said. ""Whether that is when they visit a modernized restaurant with inviting hospitality or through the convenience of having delicious food delivered to their home, we know that our fundamental day-to-day commitment to our customers is running great restaurants.""McDonald's has increased its U.S. same-store sales. Image source: McDonald's.I personally don't own McDonald's because I'm not a big fan of the chain's food. Yes, they have excellent fries, and there are times when a 10-piece McNugget holds some appeal, but I generally elect to eat at higher end fast-casual chains.However, one reason to buy McDonald's is that the company has learned that it should not be trying to win me over. Instead, it should focus on existing and lapsed customers -- people with a fondness for the chain who it might be able to win back or get more business from.Easterbrook understands that adding fresh beef to some burgers, adding delivery and enhanced drive-through options, and adjusting its value deals will help bring back fans of the brand. He's focusing on core customers and winning more business from them, and that strategy appears to be working.Still, while there are some strong reasons to buy shares in the company, some people are buying in for the wrong reason. Buy McDonald's if you believe in the company's core business proposition and Easterbrook's vision. Don't buy shares for any of the reasons below.Like many chains. McDonald's has added digital ordering options, and it has plans to greatly expand the use of kiosks in its stores. So far, these changes shift labor into customer-service roles. What they don't do is meaningfully reduce employment expenses.It's possible that eventually McDonald's will automate some production. That could cut labor costs, but it comes with a very high cost -- so it's not likely that your burger and fries will be made by robots in the next few years.Yes, some fast-casual chains have hit bumps in the road, and over-saturation has caused problems for others. But that alone won't help McDonald's. The company has always faced competition -- everything from food trucks to eating at home -- and its success depends upon its ability to appeal to its core customer, not what its rivals are doing.Fast-casual will continue to undergo some shakeout. That said, a clear audience exists for higher-quality food, and while the winners may change, the category isn't going anywhere.McDonald's has direct competitors, and those are its biggest concern. A Burger King promotion or limited-time offer is a much bigger threat to the company than the seven make-your-own pizza places opening and closing in any given neighborhood.McDonald's has invested heavily in its McCafe coffee brand, and that has worked -- up to a point. The company now sells espresso-based beverages and frozen drinks to its core audience. That likely leads to bigger check sizes, and perhaps the occasional additional visit.That's an incremental win for the chain, but it's hard to picture McCafe becoming more than that. Will a dedicated Starbucks or even Dunkin' Donuts fan change their habits? That seems very unlikely.McDonald's has become a very well-managed company. Easterbrook has shown he has a deep understanding of the business and how to manage it for the long-term. That alone is reason enough to own shares.After stumbling and struggling with its value offering, and to a lesser extent limited-time-offers, McDonald's has found its groove. Easterbrook can make incremental changes and tweaks to keep the company on track even in a challenging, changing market.

Notably, the data is based on MiniMed 670G system and was demonstrated at the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes’ 11th International Conference in Vienna, Austria.Study Results in DetailThe multi-center study had enrolled 105 participants within the 7-13 years’ age group. The trial consisted of a two-week run-in phase along with a study phase of three months. 97% of the participants chose to continue using the system as part of a Continued Access Program. Moreover, the study results demonstrated data from the pivotal trial of MiniMed 670G system on patients aged 14 years and above.Using the study results, the company has applied for an expanded FDA approval to include the patients ranging from seven to 13 years as eligible for using the MiniMed 670G system. At the same time, the company is working to expand the usage of the product on children aged between two and six years. Hopes are harbored on the effectiveness of this system, which should get greater customer adoptability over time.MiniMed 670G at a GlancePost the receipt of the FDA approval in 2016, Medtronic had commercially launched the MiniMed 670G system in June 2017. It is a Hybrid Closed Loop insulin delivery system for Type I diabetic patients aged 14 years or older. The MiniMed 670G system features Medtronic’s latest Guardian Sensor 3, a glucose sensor with increased accuracy and enhanced performance. This is the only FDA approved sensor to control a hybrid closed loop system including diagnostic technology that continuously checks sensor health. The system also carries Medtronic’s most advanced algorithm known as, SmartGuard HCL technology.Developments in Diabetes BusinessMedtronic witnessed sluggish growth in Diabetes business last quarter. However, the company gained on a strong uptake of new sensor-augmented insulin pump systems in the United States as well as in the international markets. This growth was temporarily offset by a limited supply of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) sensors. Moreover, a strong customer enrollment under the Priority Access Program briefly affected revenues.Per management, the diabetes business should witness revenue growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as the company has finished shipping pumps for the Priority Access Program. Also, the company is moving steadily with its sensor capacity expansion plans, scheduled to be completed in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.Additionally, Medtronic geared up for the international launch of the MiniMed 670G and the U.S. launch of CGM system Guardian Connect with sugar IQ in late 2018 and its new professional CGM iPro 3 in 2019. In this regard, the company also announced favorable results supporting the use of CGM on people with type 2 diabetes in October 2017.This apart, we are upbeat about Animas Corporation’s (one of the Johnson & Johnson Diabetes Care Companies) exit from the insulin pump business with Medtronic as partner to support a smooth transition for patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. Notably, patients using an Animas insulin pump will be offered the choice to switch to a Medtronic pump.Market PotentialAn ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and a rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare are likely to drive growth in the diabetes market. Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 5.93%. Given the bullish market sentiments, we believe the latest positive study results have come at an opportune moment.Share Price MovementMedtronic has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 4.7% in comparison to the broader industry’s 1.8% increase.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer PKI, Bio-Rad Laboratories BIO and Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX.PerkinElmer has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 12.3%.

Effective May 1, 2018, all full-time and part-time U.S. employees will be covered under the Medtronic Family Care Leave policy - a single, broad benefit that covers a wide range of family care leave needs, from time spent bonding with a new child, caring for ill family members, or caring for family after a spouse, child, or parent is called to active military duty.The Medtronic Family Care Leave benefit allows up to six weeks of time away from work. For birth mothers, this benefit is in addition to maternity benefits; when combined with accrued paid time off, a new mother may be on leave for up to 18 weeks and paid at 100 percent for the full leave.""These expanded benefits support our employees and their families in various life stages and make it possible for employees to dedicate their full attention to the people who matter most when needed,"" said Omar Ishrak, Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer.Previous Medtronic policies allowed for 5-7 weeks of paid leave for birth parents, one week for non-birth parents, and four weeks for compassionate leave to care for or support a terminally ill family member.""We listened closely to what our employees were saying, and the needs they described,"" said Carol Surface, Medtronic chief human resource officer. ""We believe we have created a benefit that goes well beyond current practice in the U.S. and affords Medtronic employees the valuable time they need with their families at critical times in their lives.""While the Family Care Leave policy today applies to all regular U.S. employees, Medtronic is currently evaluating benefit structures and country-specific employment laws and regulations globally to determine opportunities for additional policy changes to apply outside the United States.About MedtronicMedtronic plc (www.medtronic.com), headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, is among the world`s largest medical technology, services and solutions companies - alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life for millions of people around the world.

This expanded indication will enable patients to wear the sensor on the upper arm - delivering more flexibility and enhanced performance for users, as well as improved accuracy, with a MARD of 8.7 percent following typical calibration methods used with the MiniMed(TM) 670G system. The Guardian Sensor 3 is Medtronic`s newest and most accurate CGM to-date and is the only sensor FDA approved to control automated insulin delivery via a hybrid closed loop system - the MiniMed 670G system.""The performance of the Guardian Sensor 3 has been extremely impressive and this new arm indication now offers added convenience and flexibility for my patients who like to have as many options as possible to address their personal needs,"" said Bruce Bode, M.D., FACE, a specialist with Atlanta Diabetes Associates and a clinical associate professor at Emory University. ""These continued enhancements demonstrate a keen focus on the part of Medtronic to deliver a positive patient experience in addition to optimizing outcomes through technological advancements - that can prove to be just as meaningful for quality of life.""The Guardian Sensor 3 is currently available in the U.S. for use with the MiniMed 670G system, which is approved for people with type 1 diabetes 14 years old and above. The system features the company`s most advanced SmartGuard(TM) algorithm, which helps to increase Time in Range by automatically adjusting basal insulin delivery every 5 minutes based on real-time data delivered by the Guardian Sensor 3. The sensor incorporates diagnostic technology that continuously monitors sensor health to ensure the consistent and reliable performance that is critical for powering a hybrid closed loop system.""We are steadfast in our commitment to delivering both best-in-class clinical outcomes as well as best-in-class experiences for our customers,"" said Alejandro Galindo, president of the Intensive Insulin Management division within the Diabetes Group at Medtronic. ""We are inspired by the many voices in the diabetes community who continue to shape our offerings in a meaningful way as we work to address the wide spectrum of needs within the community. We are very pleased to offer this added flexibility for those who rely on our therapies for their diabetes management needs.""Time in Range Time in Range refers to the percentage of time people with type 1 diabetes spend in the optimal glycemic range of 70-180 mg/dL. The goal with diabetes management is to increase time spent in this healthy range and to minimize high and low sugar levels, which can lead to both immediate and long-term complications such as damage to blood vessels - increasing the risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, and stroke. Damage to blood vessels can also lead to loss of vision, kidney disease, and nerve problems. Increasing the ""Time in Range"" over the long-term can best be accomplished by using advances in diabetes therapies, like the MiniMed 670G system with SmartGuard technology, that automates basal insulin.Medtronic`s Guardian(TM) Sensor 3Click the thumbnail above for a larger image.About the Diabetes Group at Medtronic (www.medtronicdiabetes.com)Medtronic is working together with the global community to change the way people manage diabetes.

His counsel will be sorely missed,” Freddie Mac CEO Donald H. Layton said in announcement. “At the same time, we welcome to Freddie Mac Ricardo Anzaldua, an accomplished attorney and experienced general counsel whose experience and advice will be invaluable as we prepare for the future.” A media spokesperson for Freddie Mac did not immediately respond for further comment on the appointment. According to his Linkedin profile, Anzaldua graduated from Harvard Law in 1990 and later that year began working at Clearly, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, where he was made partner in 1999.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Disney (DIS), Caterpillar (CAT) and MetLife (MET). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Disney’s shares have lost -3.2% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry’s -1.6% decline in that same time period. Disney’s impressive second-quarter fiscal 2018 results benefited from continuing strength at Parks & Resorts segment and stupendous success of Marvel title Black Panther, which were enough to mitigate another dismal performance from ESPN segment. Parks & Resorts gained from significant visitor growth, increased per capita spending and shift in the timing of the Easter holiday. However, higher programming costs negatively impacted ESPN’s profitability. The Zacks analyst thinks continued subscriber loss remains a concern for the division. Additionally, higher spending on ESPN+ is likely to hurt profitability. Nevertheless, Disney’s scintillating slate of movie titles, Avengers: Infinity War’s impressive collections and strong book rates at Parks & Resorts are positive developments that will help the stock to rebound in the rest of fiscal 2018.(You can read the full research report on Disney here >>>).Shares of Strong Buy-ranked Caterpillar have gained +46.4% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Construction and Mining industry which has increased +45.1% over the same period. Driven by strong order rates, increasing backlog, positive economic indicators Caterpillar expects adjusted EPS at $10.25-$11.25 for 2018, the mid-point of which reflects year-over-year rise of 56%. The Zacks analyst thinks the Construction segment will benefit from infrastructure development in China and continued demand improvement in North American residential, non-residential and infrastructure markets. Rising commodity prices will drive Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation’s revenues. Cost cutting efforts and additional investments in expanded offerings and services will drive growth.(You can read the full research report on Caterpillar here >>>).Buy-ranked MetLife’s shares have lost -10.9% over the last year, underperforming the Zacks Multi-Line Insurance industry, which has declined -2% over the same period. However, MetLife’s efforts to streamline business, only to focus on core business, are really impressive, according to the Zacks analyst. Its revenues grew in 2017 after declining for two years and the trend is likely to continue in 2018. Its strong international operations and disciplined capital management should drive long-term growth. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised upward over the last 60 days. Nevertheless, exposure to catastrophe losses and investment in efficiency programs will put pressure on margins.(You can read the full research report on MetLife here >>>).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Becton, Dickinson (BDX), Celgene (CELG) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>Mark VickerySenior EditorNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

The Zacks analyst is bullish about the company's strategic buyouts.Revlimid, Pomalyst Fuel Celgene (CELG) Amid Pipeline SetbackPer the Zacks analyst, Revlimid should drive growth for Celgene. The company is making strategic acquisitions to boost its pipeline given the recent setbacks to lessen dependence on Revlimid.Phillips 66's (PSX) Debt Load Offset by Chemical Unit FocusThe Zacks analyst believes that concerns regarding Phillips 66's rising debt load will be offset by the company's focus on more profitable business units like Midstream and Chemicals.Fleet Upgrade Buoys Allegiant (ALGT) Amid High Fuel CostsThe Zacks analyst likes the company's efforts to modernize its fleet. High fuel costs are, however, limiting bottom-line growth. Safety-related issues also raise concerns.Cosan's (CZZ) Healthy Businesses to Negate Costs HeadwindsPer a Zacks analyst, Cosan's solid segmental businesses, including that of Raizen Energia and Combustiveis, Comgas, Moove and Rumo, will offset high costs and debts.FireEye (FEYE) Gains on Buyouts & Business Model ShiftThe Zacks analyst thinks that FireEye's recovery is on track with its business model shift, product refreshes, buyouts and cost optimization moves, as evident from its improving top and bottom lines.Yum! Brands (YUM) Grows on Re-Franchising, High Costs HurtThe Zacks analyst believes that Yum! Brands' refranchising efforts are facilitating EPS growth. However high costs associated with restaurant operations remains a concern.Focus on Investment, Seasonality to Aid NCI Building (NCS)Per the Zacks analyst, NCI Building's investment in automation and process innovation will assist margins. It will also benefit in the second half from favorable weather conditions for construction.Orbital Buy and Focus on ISR Wing to Drive Northrop (NOC)Per the Zacks analyst Northrop will gain from the acquisition of Orbital, which expands its product portfolio. Rising need for intelligence equipment will boost demand for Northrop's ISR technologies.Five Below's (FIVE) Focus on Pre-Teen Customers to Fuel SalesPer the Zacks analyst, Five Below's impressive merchandise, focus on pre-teen customers & pricing strategy should drive sales. Notably, comparable sales have been improving over the past few quarters.Higher Raw Material Costs Weigh on PPG Industries (PPG)The Zacks analyst is worried about PPG Industries' exposure to raw materials cost pressure. Raw material inflation is expected to continue through Q2, which may affect its margins.Competition & Weak Fitness Demand Hurts Fitbit (FIT) Per the Zacks analyst, mounting competition from Apple, Garmin and Xiaomi in the wearables space and weak demand for its new fitness products continues to dampen Fitbit's sales and income.Smartphone Weakness & Higher Expenses Hurt Amkor (AMKR)Despite Amkor's gains through acquisitions, the Zacks analyst believes that weakness in the smartphone market, higher expenses and integration issues may deter the company's growth.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is because casinos attract a particular set of consumers whose preferences remain more or less similar in adverse market conditions.In addition to this, the legalization of sports betting outside Nevada has widened the scope for casino operators since illegal betting is valued at billions of dollars annually in the United States. Further, casino operators are collaborating with the hospitality sector, setting up luxury hotels and generating high-margin non-gaming revenues. Subsequently, backed by discretionary spending and a stable demand for casino services, the industry is poised to witness long-term growth.But the industry has its share of hurdles to overcome. Slowdown in Macau gaming revenues continues to be a concern for the industry in the short run. Moreover, a trade war between Beijing and Washington is hurting casino operators in Macau. Though gaming revenues from Macau increased for the 27th consecutive month in October, the growth rate has softened since the second quarter. Additionally, waning property price in China impacted the high-end VIP segment.Against such a backdrop, leading casino companies like Wynn Resorts WYNN, Penn National Gaming, Inc. PENN, Las Vegas Sands Corp. LVS and MGM Resorts International MGM are continuously devising strategies to drive revenues and profits. In response to a rapidly evolving and dynamic market, Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts are capitalizing on the significant profit associated with the business. Both the companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and have respective market capitalization of $40.4 billion and $13.6 billion. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Let us find out which stock is set to serve better returns to investors.Price Performance and Earnings & Revenue EstimatesArguably, earnings growth is of the utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels indicate solid prospects (and stock price gains). For 2018, Las Vegas Sands’ earnings are expected to grow 10.9%. Moreover, its 2018 year-over-year sales growth is projected to be 6.7%. MGM Resorts’ 2018 earnings and sales are likely to improve 5.9% and 8.3%, respectively.MGM Resorts’ shares have lost 21.1% in the past year while Las Vegas Sands’ shares declined 20.8%. Meanwhile, the industry recorded collective decline of 30.7%.ValuationSince casino stocks are debt-laden, it makes sense to value those based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just its equity but also the level of debt on a company’s balance sheet.For capital-intensive companies, the EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is unaffected by changing capital structures and ignores effects of non-cash expenses on a company’s value. The trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of MGM Resorts is 26.82 while that of Las Vegas Sands is 14.06. With the industry average being 19.82x, Las Vegas Sands has an edge over MGM Resorts.Debt RatioSince the sector has high financial leverage, debt-to-asset ratio comes into the picture. Both the companies' excessive reliance on debt financing is a concern. As of Sep 30, 2018, cash and cash equivalents of MGM Resorts were $1.3 billion compared with a much higher long-term debt of $14.7 billion. For Las Vegas Sands, unrestricted cash balance was $4.8 billion as of Sep 30, 2018. However, total debt outstanding — including the current portion, and net of deferred financing costs and original issue discount — was as high as $12 billion.By looking at debt-to-asset ratio, we can have a sense of a company’s ability to meet its long-term debt. Leisure stocks should ideally have lower debt ratios, implying higher proportion of the company’s assets over the long term. Las Vegas Sands’ debt ratio is 51.3 compared with the industry’s 55.8 and MGM Resorts’ 48.9.Return on Equity & Net MarginLas Vegas Sands delivered a return on equity (ROE) of 34.2% in the trailing 12 months compared with 4.5% growth recorded by the industry. MGM Resorts’ ROE is 4.5%. This indicates that Las Vegas Sands reinvests more efficiently than MGM Resorts.Traditionally, gross margin for the hospitality companies is comparatively higher as majority of expenses come from the cost of operations. However, the sector’s profits are not very high, which is evident from the net profit margin or net margin. The industry’s trailing 12-month net margin is 3.2% while that of Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts is 27.7% and 16.8%, respectively.Bottom LineWhile Las Vegas Sands’ projected earnings and margins are more promising than MGM Resorts’, the latter’s debt ratio is encouraging. However, Las Vegas Sands surpasses MGM Resorts in terms of valuation, ROE and share price movement. Please take a look at the following table to compare the two gaming giants.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

It also generates some $2 billion in annual revenue.However, the New York Post reports that activist investor Starboard Value recently established a $500 million stake in MGM with the goal of getting a seat on the board of directors and pushing for big changes: It wants to go all-in on Vegas by divesting its Macau resorts as well as merging its real estate investment trust with the one spun off from Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ: CZR).Rumor has it this hedge fund wants MGM Resorts out of Macau to focus on Las Vegas instead. Image source: Getty Images.MGM owns two integrated resorts in China, the MGM Macau and the newly opened MGM Cotai, which is cannibalizing some gaming revenue from the older resort. There could be a few reasons why the hedge fund wants the casino operator out of China.Macau's growth is slowing. Although gaming revenues this year are 17% higher than at the same point in 2017, the rate of growth is less. That's not necessarily a warning sign -- the region was just coming out of a two-year slump brought on by crackdown on corruption, so comparisons to 2016 would be skewed -- but it suggests Macau's growth may be reaching a plateau.The Chinese economy is also slowing, and an escalation of a trade war between the U.S. and China would fall hard on Macau. MGM will also be the first of the three U.S. casino operators to have its concession come up for renewal in 2020 (Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts follow two years later), and the nascent market in Japan may siphon off gamblers when it gets up and running.Shares of the four casino operators have fallen by double-digit rates this year, but that's just as much a result of Las Vegas weakening as Macau's soft numbers. In fact, Macau gaming revenues rallied sharply in August, bounding 17% higher to $26.6 billion patacas, or about $3.3 billion (patacas are the local currency in Macau). Revenue may get dinged because of the massive Typhoon Mangkhut that tore through the region at the same time the Carolinas were getting hit by Hurricane Florence, but October kicks off with a week-long national holiday that tends to cause a spike in revenues.MGM data by YCharts.After badly missing analyst forecasts for revenue and earnings in the second quarter, Wynn Resorts said it was looking for continued softness in the third quarter because of fewer events being scheduled at its Las Vegas properties. Caesars underscored that outlook when it noted that fewer convention events are being scheduled, pointing specifically to the Floyd Mayweather and Conor MacGregor boxing match last year, which was a big draw that won't repeat itself.There's not a clear-cut trend in favor of Las Vegas over Macau, so Starboard Value's willingness to bet big on the domestic market to the exclusion of others doesn't make sense -- but maybe that's because it's just a rumor. According to recent Bloomberg reporting, sources say Starboard has not taken a stake in MGM Resorts and has no financial interest in the resort operator. The hedge fund itself refused to comment.MGM China generates $2 billion in annual revenue for MGM Resorts, and despite all of the twists and turns, Macau remains a lucrative, growing market. It would seem to be a foolhardy move to cut MGM off from this revenue stream when Las Vegas hasn't shown any indication that it's about to have a hot hand.

And, obviously, when you’re talking about a multimillion dollar wager, I have a protocol that I have to go through, and we finally facilitated that bet on Wednesday,” Jay Rood, MGM Resorts International’s (NYSE:MGM) vice president of race and sports, told FOX Business.Prior to the bet, Rood said he was seeing good two-way action on both sides but since this bet on the Eagles was confirmed, he dropped the point spread below what the rest of the market was dictating.“Most people around the world are minus 5.5 or minus 5 and I’m minus 4.5, so I’m sort of manufacturing some Patriots money for myself right now,” Rood said. “So, in the last 24 hours, we have seen predominantly Patriots money come in, but that is sort of by design on my part.”Rood added that he normally doesn’t see wagers of that size show up in the first week, which essentially caused the drop.“So, it was a little bit odd but ideally, it’s much better for me as a bookmaker to have received this bet early so it gives me opportunity to do what I need to do to make sure this wager sits into our philosophy of risk management,” he said, adding that late next week, he expects to get a strong handle on both sides leading up to the big day.“I mean last year we had really strong handle show up on Saturday and Sunday with several large wagers when the Patriots took on the Atlanta Falcons,” he said. “And I got to believe the Eagles fan base is every bit as loyal and strong as they are. So, this could potentially be one of the strongest matchups that we’ve had in a long time for a Super Bowl.”Related Articles UAW President Denies Collective Bargaining Deals Tainted by Scandal -- Update UAW President Denies Collective Bargaining Deals Tainted by Scandal -- UpdateAlaska officials want some state areas out of drilling planTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

The memory chip giant more than tripled its bottom-line earnings on a 58% revenue surge, exceeding Wall Street's targets on both the top and bottom lines. More importantly, Micron provided clear signs that the good times should continue to roll in the long run.MetricQ2 2018Q2 2017Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$7.35 billion$4.65 billion58%Net income attributable to Micron$3.31 billion$894 million270%GAAP earnings per diluted share$2.67$0.77247%Data source: Micron Technology.Many companies are adding substantial one-time tax items to their results these days, to account for December's shakeup of the U.S. tax code. In Micron's case, the one-time charges and benefits triggered by that event largely balanced each other out. Micron's corporate tax rate will fall from 35% in 2017 to 21% for the 2019 fiscal year, with the 2018 period splitting the difference at roughly 25.7%. That's an effect of Micron's fiscal years not matching the calendar year.Image source: Micron Technology.Above all else, my takeaway from this report is that Micron's business environment is as healthy as ever, with several sustainable drivers of future memory chip demand. Most of the numbers required to reach this conclusion weren't part of the earnings report itself but were presented on the earnings call instead.Smartphones are shipping with larger DRAM quantities than ever, and it's not a small jump. The last generation of high-end Android phones topped out at 4 gigabytes of operating memory. Now, some models are sporting 6 GB -- somewhere between 50% and double the memory reserves found in 2017's flagships. Since DRAM chips accounted for 71% of Micron's second-quarter sales, and a large portion of that revenue stream came from mobile memory chips, this trend is great for Micron's top line.The same thing is happening to long-term storage in modern smartphones, where most high-end phones used to come with at least 32 GB of NAND-based storage and 64 GB as a pricier option. In this generation, the base level is doubling to 64 GB, making room for even larger luxury options that are sure to become next generation's standard storage allowance. On top of this, very large solid-state drives are driving NAND demand in the corporate computing industry.NAND chips carry lower gross margins than DRAM -- 47% versus 66% in Micron's second quarter -- but it's all good because both product categories are highly profitable.Having sustainable long-term growth trends behind both product categories ensures stable unit prices -- as long as the remaining handful of memory chip suppliers continue to grow their production capacity at a reasonable speed to avoid another price war.Once upon a time, it made sense to flood the memory market every now and then, shaking out the weak hands. The survivors snapped up the remains of their defeated competitors at bargain-basement bankruptcy discounts. Chip prices would stabilize again a few quarters later, allowing the stable of even bigger winners to collect some fresh cash to finance the next round of deal-hunting.Several rounds of this approach led Micron and its last two serious rivals -- SK Hynix (NASDAQOTH: HXSCL) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) -- to dominate the memory market and pull all the levers to control the supply and-demand balance. It is in the best interest of all three key suppliers to maintain healthy unit prices these days, and this newfound pricing stability just might be here to stay for the long haul.As a Micron shareholder, I'm a happy camper. If this mature stability really is the new ""normal"" for the global memory chip industry, then Micron's stock is severely undervalued at 8.5 times trailing earnings and 6 times forward estimates.

Both of the semiconductor powers are also currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks. So let’s dive into some of Micron and Nvidia’s current fundamentals to see if either stock looks more appealing at the moment.Stock MovementOne of the best places for investors to start when evaluating a stock is its price movement. Before today’s climb, Nvidia had seen its stock price soar 1,079% over the last three years, which outpaces Micron’s 185% climb. Over the last two years, the stocks are a little more evenly matched, with NVDA up 416% compared to MU’s 332% expansion—both of which crush Wall Street darling Amazon’s AMZN 135%  climb as well as fellow chip giant Intel’s INTC 52%.Narrowing down our focus, MU stock has climbed above NVDA over the last year, up 85% compared to roughly 73% for its peer. Investors should also note that 2018 has not been as kind to either Micron or Nvidia. Still, Micron has seen its stock price surge roughly 32%, while Nvidia has jumped 24% since the start of the year.More recently, MU and NVDA have both sunk roughly 9% during the last month, with both sitting below their 52-week highs. This should be good news since both stocks could be purchased at a lower price than they have traded at recently. But investors also need to understand their current valuation picture.ValuationComing into Monday, Micron stock was trading at 4.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a discount compared the S&P 500’s 16.8X and its industry’s 11.3 X—which includes Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Texas Instruments TXN. Over the last year, Micron stock has traded as high as 6.8X, as low as 4.1X, and rocks a one-year median of 5.5X.At 33.1X, NVDA is trading at a significant premium compared to Micron, its industry, and the S&P. With that said, Nvidia stock has traded as high as 57.4X over the last year, with a one-year median of 44.1X, and it is currently trading just above its year-long low of 32.9X Stepping out a bit further, investors should be able to see that it is not too much of a stretch to say that Nvidia stock appears rather attractive at this current valuation. Meanwhile, Micron stock looks like one of the stronger value plays on the market, especially considering its growth projections.OutlookNow let’s look ahead because there is little reason to buy stocks that don’t seem to present any real ability to keep on climbing based on expanding top and bottom lines.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues to hit $8.22 billion, which would mark over a 33.8% climb from the year-ago period. Micron’s fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to soar over 48% to reach $30.13 billion. Moving onto the other end of the income statement, the company’s full-year earnings are expected to soar over 136% to reach $11.72 per share, while its Q4 EPS figure is expected to expand by 63% to hit $3.30 per share.Transitioning to Nvidia, the company is projected to report Q2 fiscal 2019 revenues of $3.11 billion, representing a roughly 39% jump from the year-ago period. For its current full-year, Nvidia’s revenues are expected to surge nearly 36% to touch $13.18 billion. The company’s adjusted earnings are expected to expand by just over 81% this quarter and 61% for the year.Bottom LineBoth Nvidia and Micron are currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, with MU sporting an overall “A” VGM score and NVDA rocking an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Investors will also be pleased to note that NVDA and MU have received a ton of earnings estimate revisions recently.Micron has earned eight upward earnings estimate revisions for the full-year, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 30 days. Likewise, Nvidia has received 12 full-year revisions against zero downgrades, over the last 60 days.Clearly, it is hard to go wrong with either stock at the moment as both are projected to experience strong top and bottom line growth. The companies also operate in a growth industry and have set their sights on new areas just starting to boom, from AI to self-driving vehicle technology. Still, at the moment, the advantage has to go to Micron because of its outstanding value.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Micron MU.Here is a synopsis of all three stocks:Bull of the Day:Salesforce has seen its stock price jump over 12% in the last three months as the firm continues to bolster its cloud-based customer relationship management offerings. Looking ahead, Salesforce’s top and bottom line growth is something investors might not want to miss.Overview & Recent NewsSalesforce operates within the quickly growing customer relationship management industry that looks poised to become even popular as more businesses adapt to a nearly completely digital age. The company currently boasts over 150,000 business clients, including giants such as Adidas and U.S. Bancorp, offering them a wide range of services that would otherwise require a ton of in-house computing power, technological infrastructure, and maintenance.   Last quarter, Salesforce saw its revenues soar roughly 27% to reach $3.28 billion. The San Francisco-based firm recently announced that it upgraded its Financial Services Cloud to help companies offer a more unified customer experience. Salesforce also launched Quip Slides—an interactive slide presentation tool—to help it better compete against the likes of Microsoft and Google.Salesforce purchased Quip roughly two years ago, which helped the company roll out Microsoft Office-like products designed for the cloud from word processing to spreadsheets. Plus, the company announced on Thursday a new wrinkle to its Einstein artificial intelligence system called Einstein Voice. The service will allow users to conversationally update tasks on Salesforce, receive audible briefings, explore Salesforce’s dashboard, and more.The move highlights the prevalence of voice assistants from Amazon’s Alexa to Apple’s Siri. “We're in the midst of an incredible technological shift, where the power of voice is fundamentally changing the way we work,"" Salesforce Co-Founder and CTO Parker Harris said in a company statement. “Einstein Voice will usher in a new era of conversational CRM, delivering new levels of productivity and redefining customer experiences with voice technology.”Bear of the Day:Campbell Soup Company shares have plummeted roughly 21% over the last three years as the packaged food firm tries to navigate shifting consumer habits and the proliferation of healthier upstart options. Overview Campbell reported its Q4 and full-year financial results at the end of August and it wasn’t pretty. The firm’s fourth-quarter sales dipped 3% from the year-ago period, excluding a 36-point benefit from its recent acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods. Campbell’s organic full-year revenues slipped 2%.These recent acquisitions were made to help the company try to compete in a more diverse market, geared toward fresh and healthy options. Meanwhile, Campbell’s Q4 marketing and selling expenses soared 29% as it tried to incorporate its new brands. Now, Campbell hopes to sell its international and refrigerated-foods businesses, which include Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh, and Kelsen brands, among others.Campbell’s is not alone, Coca-Cola is set to purchase UK coffee giant Costa for $5.1 billion as it tries to expand its portfolio beyond sugary drinks. However, Campbell’s latest effort, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal and later confirmed by the company, will see it somewhat abandon its plans to offer healthier options. The company also reportedly remains open to an outright sale.Price Movement The last three years have not been kind to Campbell stock. Shares of CPB have fallen over 21% in the last 36 months, which looks even worse compared to the S&P 500’s nearly 50% jump. Campbell’s woes have continued despite a brief June jump. In fact, shares of CPB are down over 16% since the start of the year. But investors will notice that its industry hasn’t performed well either and is down over 7% during this same period.Additional content:Micron (MU) Beats on Top & Bottom Lines, Shares UpAmerican memory and storage tech firm Micron has released fiscal Q4 2018 (ended August) earnings after Thursday's closing bell, with typically positive results: earnings of $3.53 per share easily beat the Zacks consensus of $3.32, with year-over-year earnings growth up 75%. Quarterly sales posted $8.44 billion, which is not only well above the estimated $8.25 billion but even higher than the top on the previously guided revenue range of $8.4 billion.Gross margins in the quarter reached 61%, near the top of that guidance range. In terms of earnings results, this marks the 13th straight positive surprise -- you need to go back to fiscal Q3 2015 for the last time Micron missed expectations. After hours, MU shares are trading up 2+%.However, the stock is still down more than 20% since this past spring, and part of this has to do with NAND and DRAM businesses -- at which Micron excels -- is losing steam. So while Micron itself is bringing in 50% more revenues from the year-ago quarter, investors don't currently have much faith in the company's overall business environment. Prior to its earnings report, Micron carried a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with a Zacks Style Score (Value - Growth - Momentum) of A. For more on MU's earnings, click here.The company's conference call, scheduled to get underway a few minutes from now, will be crucial to the fortunes of this stock going forward. Guidance will play a critical role in where Micron -- an its sub-industries -- can be expected to go from here. Right now, the company estimates $2.88 per share for its November (Q1 2019) quarter, and $8.35 billion on the top line.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

Yet even though more than 30 investment firms cover the stock's every move -- and millions of investors around the world follow the company daily -- there are some interesting aspects of Microsoft's history of which many people are not aware.Here are seven things about Microsoft you may not yet know.Image source: Microsoft.When Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates was a Harvard freshman back in 1974, his resume listed a starting salary of $15,000. But rather than graduate and head off in search of a corporate job, he quit school to co-found Microsoft. Gates would become the youngest billionaire in the world in 1987 at the age of 31, shortly after Microsoft's IPO. Today, he has a net worth of $91.8 billion, according to Forbes.Fortunately, ""Windows"" eventually won out. Microsoft would go on to sell hundreds of millions of licenses of its now ubiquitous operating system (OS), generating billions of dollars of profits along the way.While attending high school, Bill Gates wrote a more efficient scheduling program for his principal. Yet unbeknownst to school officials, the program also contained a benefit for Gates: It placed him in classes with the most female students.Gates would go on to find love years later and is now happily married to his wife Melinda. Together, they run The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which serves as the epicenter of their philanthropic efforts.Since its IPO on March 13, 1986, Microsoft's stock has risen more than 90,000%. Even better, when factoring in dividends paid to shareholders, Microsoft's stock has delivered total returns of over 135,000%.MSFT Total Return Price data by YCharts.Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering its staggering growth, Microsoft is believed to have created at least two billionaires other than Gates -- including co-founder Paul Allen and former CEO Steve Ballmer -- as well as more than 12,000 millionaires.Just months before Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006, Microsoft passed on the opportunity to purchase it for less than a third of the price. A decade later, YouTube is one of Google's most powerful growth drivers, with some analysts valuing the popular video-sharing site at as much as $75 billion.Microsoft also launched some of the first smartphones and tablet computers on the market. But these early devices met with lackluster demand, and Microsoft squandered its first-mover advantage. Years later, archrival Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) launched its category-defining iPhone and iPad devices. Apple would go on to sell hundreds of millions of these products, becoming the most valuable company in the world in the process.The competition between Microsoft and Apple also made rivals out of their founders. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates often had very different worldviews. Jobs thought Gates was too narrowly focused on business. In fact, Jobs once said that Gates would be ""a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger.""Gates, meanwhile, didn't think much of Jobs' tech skills, but he did admire his intuition when it came to design. ""He really never knew much about technology, but he had an amazing instinct for what works,"" Gates said.In the end, Gates and Jobs respected each other. And their competition would help spur the growth of two of the most powerful businesses the world has ever seen.

Yet, even with the rise of Amazon AMZN, Facebook FB, and younger tech startups, Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT still have an outsized influence on consumers and the stock market. So let’s compare the two historic tech companies in terms of both revenue growth and stock price movement.Revenue Growth Microsoft went public at $21 per share on March 13, 1986, after Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded the company in 1975.IBM IBM introduced its first personal computer in 1981, which used Microsoft’s 16-bit operating system MS-DOS. The company then shipped its Windows 1.0 operating system in 1985 after two years of development. Microsoft reported revenues of $591 million in 1988 and then launched the earliest version of Office in August 1989.Microsoft introduced Windows 3.0 in May 1990 and went on to report fiscal 1992 sales of $2.76 billion. But it was the launch of Windows 95 that really sent the company on its massive run. Just two years later, in 1997, Microsoft reported revenues of $11.36 billion.Windows 98 was also a massive success, helping lift revenues to $18.97 billion in 1999. Steve Ballmer was then appointed CEO in 2000, one year before Microsoft introduced Office XP, Windows XP, and the Xbox.Gates transitioned away from his day-to-day role to concentrate on his charitable endeavors in 2008. The company pulled in revenues of $60.42 billion that year. Microsoft would go on to expand its business, diving into cloud computing, AI, and other new growth areas, as well as completing some splashy deals—including its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in 2016. The company reported total revenues of $89.95 billion in fiscal 2017. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started Apple Computers one year after Microsoft in 1976. The company went public four years later, on December 12, 1980, for $22 per share.Apple pulled in $4.07 billion in total revenue in 1988, four years after it launched its first Macintosh in 1984. The company saw its revenues climb 30% to $5.28 billion in 1989. Apple then grew its revenues by roughly 15% a year over the next several years, and reported revenues of $11.06 billion in 1995. But, Apple would go on to suffer three straight years of double-digit revenue declines to report sales of $5.94 billion in 1998.The company would experience a few more major downturns, and reported revenues of $5.74 billion in 2002—despite the launch of the first iPod in 2001. However, this is when things quickly started to change for Apple. The company launched the iPod mini in 2004, and the iPod video, iPod nano, and the iPod shuffle over the following few years, to push revenues to $19.32 billion by 2006.  Then, in 2007, Apple launched the iPod, and it changed the company forever. Apple reported fiscal 2008 revenues of $37.49 billion and hasn’t looked back since. The tech giant reported 2017 revenues of $229.23 billion, which marked over a 510% surge from 2008. Stock Price Movement Clearly, investors can see that Microsoft and Apple have both grown into multibillion-dollar powerhouses since they went public in the 1980s.Microsoft has experienced a smoother top-line expansion, while Apple remained relatively flat until the mid-2000s. Today, Apple’s full-year revenues are much larger then Microsoft's, but their stock price performances also paint an interesting picture.  Max Chart 15-Year Chart5-Year Chart1-Year CharBottom LineOver the long run, investors will see that MSFT has climbed higher, with Apple stock dominating throughout most of the 2000s. Yet, some might be somewhat surprised to see that shares of Microsoft have climbed above Apple over the last year.Looking ahead, Apple’s quarterly revenues are projected to climb by 15.3% to reach $52.37 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s full-year sales are projected to pop by 13.5% to hit $260.18 billion. Both of these would mark rather impressive jumps for a company of Apple’s size.Microsoft is also expected to post strong top line growth. The company is projected to post quarterly revenues of $29.17 billion, which would represent an 18% expansion. Microsoft’s fiscal year revenues are projected to surge by 15.5% to hit $109.44 billion.With that said, it certainly will be very interesting to watch both of these companies over the next few years and beyond.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

A Tandy 600 Portable Computer cost $1,599.Microsoft IPOInvestors got their first taste of Microsoft back in March 1986 when the company, already a powerhouse in the tech world, raised $61 million in an IPO under the leadership of 30-year-old founder Bill Gates. IPO shares priced at $21 per share, but Microsoft has since had nine different stock splits.

To keep it practical, we’ll show how Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Microsoft has a P/E ratio of 40.15, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 2.5%.  See our latest analysis for Microsoft  The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Microsoft:P/E of 40.15 = $98.23 ÷ $2.45 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2018.)A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each $1 of company earnings. That isn’t necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Earnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. When earnings grow, the ‘E’ increases, over time. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others — and that may attract buyers.Microsoft’s earnings per share fell by 28% in the last twelve months. But it has grown its earnings per share by 8.9% per year over the last three years. And EPS is down 2.8% a year, over the last 5 years. This might lead to muted expectations.The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that Microsoft has a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the software industry average (39.9).Microsoft’s P/E tells us that market participants think its prospects are roughly in line with its industry. The company could surprise by performing better than average, in the future. I inform my view byby checking management tenure and remuneration, among other things.It’s important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn’t take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Microsoft has net cash of US$48b. That should lead to a higher P/E than if it did have debt, because its strong balance sheets gives it more options.Microsoft has a P/E of 40.1. That’s higher than the average in the US market, which is 15.9. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the net cash position means the company has time to improve: and the high P/E suggests the market thinks it will.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. People often underestimate remarkable growth — so investors can make money when fast growth is not fully appreciated. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.Of course you might be able to find a better stock than Microsoft. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly.To help readers see past the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data.

The tech giant’s stock is up 30% since December, and was up more than 4% in early trading Thursday.Microsoft is only the third company to hit the $1 trillion mark. The company’s former chief rival, Apple (AAPL), was the first followed by Amazon (AMZN). Those two have since fallen from those highs, but still have market caps well within the $900 billion range.The Redmond, Washington-based company’s continued growth puts it in rare company among tech stocks, but it’s, surprisingly, not mentioned in the same breath as the popular FAANG stocks—Facebook (FB), Amazon, Apple, Netflix (NFLX) and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) parent company Alphabet. But look at Microsoft’s growth over the last five years, and its upward trajectory looks a lot like those other tech companies.So how did Microsoft seemingly sneak under the radar and close in on Apple and Amazon as one of the most valuable public companies in the U.S.? It’s all about the cloud and the decision to let consumers choose their own devices.Like any company as large and old as Microsoft, the software giant has had its fair share of missteps. It missed the boat entirely on the smartphone revolution. And when it did release its own Windows Phone devices, they fell flat. Meanwhile, Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android, along with their respective app stores, dominated the market. There’s a reason you’re not reading this on a Windows phone.Then there was the inauspicious launch of Microsoft’s Windows 8 operating system, which consumer and professional users both disliked.But Microsoft made the right call when it bet on the cloud. To be sure, Amazon’s Web Services cloud computing platform is the most widely used cloud system in the world. But while Amazon gets all the attention, Microsoft has built up its Azure cloud service to become the number two offering, with Google trailing behind in third.According to Ed Anderson, vice president of research and distinguished analyst at the market research Gartner, more companies are modernizing their technology needs. Cloud computing essentially lets a company rent the infrastructure needed to create and deploy apps, manage remote storage and run virtual computers.“Microsoft has made some really smart investments that make them relevant to that discussion,” Anderson said. And while Amazon, he said, epitomizes the transition to this new kind of IT workspace, Microsoft, Anderson explained, has managed to reinvigorate its already massive built-in user base.Of course, it doesn’t hurt that Microsoft has transitioned its Office offering to a cloud service, which helps ensure a continuous revenue stream rather than a one-time license sale and helps lock customers into the company’s business.Microsoft’s Azure, meanwhile, is an incremental change with some new, impressive technologies for existing Microsoft enterprise customers, Anderson explained. Amazon, on the other hand, is attracting new customers.Microsoft’s current CEO, Satya Nadella, deserves a lot of the credit for the massive cultural shift at the tech giant that helped drag the company into the modern IT age by ensuring that all devices are compatible with Microsoft’s offerings. In the past, if you didn’t have a Windows computer and wanted to use a piece of Microsoft software, you were out of luck. Today, Microsoft welcomes devices from brands across the tech industry landscape.Still, the massive growth Microsoft has seen in recent years isn’t just Nadella’s doing. Former CEO Steve Ballmer laid the groundwork by kicking off the Office 365 and Azure initiatives. But Nadella’s appointment to CEO helped bring about renewed interest in the company from investors and customers alike.That won’t last forever, though. Microsoft needs to continue to innovate if it wants to hold on to the momentum it’s seen in recent years and give Amazon a run for its money.“They’ve got to be seen as a provider who is going to take their customers, as well as new customers, into the future,” Anderson explained. “And right now Amazon, and like I said to a lesser extent Google, kind of own that mindshare. Microsoft has got to make that transition.”That means this new, reinvigorated Microsoft might not last long, especially if Amazon and Google manage to innovate more than the Windows maker.A version of this story previously ran in November 2018.More from Dan:The Sony PlayStation Classic review: Retro with some trade-offsBlack Friday items you shouldn’t buyThe best Black Friday tech deals‘Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu’ and ‘Let’s Go, Eevee’ review: A little old, a little newApple Mac mini reviewDon’t freak out about Apple’s iPhone sales numbersEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@oath.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

And while his wealth is an extreme example, if you had bet on Microsoft in its early days in the mid-1980s, your gamble would have paid off big time, too.A $1,000 investment in Microsoft on the day of its initial public offering, or IPO, on March 13, 1986, would be worth more than $1.6 million today, according to CNBC calculations. That includes price appreciation and dividends.While Microsoft's stock has performed well, any individual stock can over- or under-perform and past returns do not predict future results .Microsoft's stock prices as of November 19, 2018, at 1:02 p.m. ET. Click to enlargeMicrosoft's success came long before its IPOMicrosoft was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, two friends from high school who bonded over their mutual love of computer science . Gates dropped out of college after his sophomore year at Harvard so he and Allen could focus on adapting BASIC, a popular programming language, for use on early personal computers.By 1978, the company's year-end sales were over $1 million.Information technology IBM hired Microsoft in 1980 to develop a non-exclusive operating system for its first personal computer. That system became MS-DOS, one of Microsoft's most profitable products ever. MS-DOS was used in all IBM computers at the time and also became the go-to operating system for almost every PC on the market.Microsoft waited 11 years before going public, primarily because Gates wanted to retain as much control of the company as possible. It helped that Microsoft was so profitable that it didn't need outside money in order to grow.Since Gates had begun selling shares and offering stock options to prospective employees in order to entice top talent, though, Microsoft President and Chief Operating Officer Jon A. Shirley projected that, by 1987, enough people would own Microsoft stock that the company would be forced to register with the SEC. Gates finally acquiesced to the idea of an initial public offering because the IPO would create a much wider, more liquid market for the company's shares.Microsoft went public on March 13, 1986, at an opening price of $21 per share. However, ""the first trade took place at $25.50 a share, an indication of the fierce demand for the stock,"" the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported at the time .Throughout the day, just over 3 million shares were sold. Originally, only 2.5 million were offered, but the number was raised to meet demand.Both Gates and Allen immediately became multi-millionaires. Gates earned $1.6 million off the shares he sold and put a market value of $350 million on the 45 percent stake he retained, Fortune reports, making the 30-year-old one of the richest people in the country. Allen had left Microsoft years earlier but held onto a significant stake in the company.Gates's wealth ballooned from there and, in 1987, he made history as the youngest person to ever become a billionaire. By 1995, his fortune had grown to $12.9 billion, making him, at 39, the world's richest man. He retained that title for years.Gates ran Microsoft until 2000, when he stepped down as CEO in order to focus on philanthropy.Even after leaving Microsoft, Allen remained a titan in the tech industry, as well as an influential member of the Seattle community. He died in October 2018 at age 65 from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Microsoft has sometimes struggled to find its identityPost-IPO, Microsoft continued to dominate the software industry. On the heels of the release of Windows 2.0 in 1987, it became the largest software company in the world by sales.Over the next few decades, Microsoft continued to innovate and expand its scope. One of its most successful releases came in the in the mid-90s with the introduction of Windows 95. Microsoft sold an astounding 40 million copies in its first year . In 2001, the company introduced the Xbox, which was also an immediate hit and sold 1.5 million units in less than two months . The console grounded Microsoft in the video game space, and that became one of its most profitable divisions .Microsoft has also faced plenty of setbacks over the years. In the late 90s, the company faced antitrust charges from the U.S. Department of Justice and, in the early 2000s, it released a string of unpopular products , including the Zune music player, Windows Vista operating system and Surface tablet.When Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, he began a major turnaround at the software company. From the beginning, Nadella embraced cloud computing and helped Microsoft emerge as a top competitor in the space, challenging Amazon Web Services and others.Microsoft also expanded its reach through the acquisitions of professional networking site LinkedIn in 2016 and code-sharing service GitHub in 2018. The deals helped boost the company's user network and emphasize the new direction Microsoft has taken in recent years. The acquisition of GitHub, especially, showed the company's willingness to embrace new technology, even if it doesn't directly control it .Since Nadella took over, Microsoft's share price has nearly tripled. It stands as one of the most powerful companies in the tech industry, with a market cap that rivals those of Amazon and Google . Like this story?  Subscribe to CNBC Make It on YouTube  !

MAA — commonly referred as MAA — is facing two lawsuits regarding rent late-fee practices.Plaintiffs Cathi Cleven and Tara Cleven as well as Nathanael Brown in two Class Action lawsuits had earlier alleged that the residential real estate investment trust (REIT) is in violation of Section 92.019 of the Texas Property Code. Per the code, a landlord cannot charge a tenant a late fee for failing to pay rent unless “the fee is a reasonable estimate of uncertain damages to the landlord that are incapable of precise calculation and result from late payment of rent.”  Both respective plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment and argued that the company failed to conduct a prospective estimate of its damages before assessing a late fee, required by Section 92.019.Per the company’s recent 8-K filing, it charges $75 on the fourth day of the month if the rent is unpaid and $10 for each additional day, up to 15 days.On Sep 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, approved the Cleven and Brown classes proposed by the plaintiffs. Following this, on Sep 18, the court granted the plaintiffs' motions for partial summary judgment, which applies to each of the classes and denied MAA's motions for summary judgment.For both cases, the District Court concluded that MAA had violated Section 92.019 because it failed to provide documentation or other evidence of the estimation process in which it engaged, and consequently, any rent late fee charged by the company violated the statute.MAA estimates that its maximum exposure in Cleven is $54.6 million and $8.4 million in Brown, aggregating $63 million in damages. Nonetheless, the company believes it is not in violation of Texas law and intends to “vigorously defend” itself and pursue all available appeals of the trial court’s decision.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 16.3%, outperforming its industry’s rally of 13% over the past six months.  Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT space are VICI Properties VICI, Park Hotels and Resorts, Inc.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Texas Instruments (TXN), Union Pacific (UNP) and Mondelez (MDLZ). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Strong Buy-ranked Texas Instruments’ shares have gained +31.8% in the last year, underperforming the Zacks General Semiconductor industry which has gained +58.4% over the same period. However, Texas Instruments reported strong first quarter results on the back of strength in auto and industrial markets. The Zacks analyst likes the fact that the company continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars in several high margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets. Margins continue to expand on secular strength in the auto and industrial markets and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output. Continuous dividend hike is a big positive. However, increasing competition, unfavorable currency effect and a high debt load remain concerns.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here >>>).Shares of Union Pacific have outperformed the Zacks Rail industry (+13.9 vs. +8.6%) as well as fellow railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corp. (+11.3%) over the last year. Ushering in further good news, the company reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the first quarter of 2018. Both the metrics also improved year over year. Apart from higher freight revenues, volume growth and lower tax rates aided results. Efforts to reward shareholders are also encouraging. Additionally, efforts of the company toward promoting safety are commendable. However, Union Pacific’s decision to withdraw its operating ratio guidance of around 60% in 2019 due to operational issues raises concerns. Other factors like high operating expenses and debt levels are worrisome as well.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here >>>).Mondelez’s shares have lost -12.8% in the last year, outperforming the -17.4% decline of the Zacks Food Preparation industry. Mondelez reported first-quarter 2018 results, with earnings and revenues beating the consensus mark. The company posted impressive results on the back of strong performance in Asia, Middle East & Africa and Europe. Adjusted earnings grew 9.6%, primarily driven by favorability on interest and less number of shares outstanding. Net revenues increased 5.5 % driven by currency tailwinds. Emerging markets’ net revenues rose 7.6% and the same for Power Brands rose 8.2%. Regionally, Asia, Middle East & Africa and Europe registered an increase of 3.4% and 14.4% in revenues, respectively. However, revenues in the North America and Latin America declined 1.3% and 2.1%, respectively. Also, gross margin was down 110 basis points (bps) due to unfavorable mix, higher commodity costs and freight inflation.(You can read the full research report on Mondelez here >>>).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Estee Lauder (EL), MetLife (MET) and Marsh & McLennan (MMC).More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

Common characteristics for these big stocks are their strong balance sheet and high market liquidity, which means there’s plenty of stocks available to the public for trading. In times of low liquidity in the market, these firms won’t be left high and dry. They are also relatively unaffected by increases in interest rates. Using the most recent data for MNST, I will determine its financial status based on its solvency and liquidity, and assess whether the stock is a safe investment.  View our latest analysis for Monster Beverage  What is considered a high debt-to-equity ratio differs depending on the industry, because some industries tend to utilize more debt financing than others. As a rule of thumb, a financially healthy large-cap should have a ratio less than 40%. The good news for investors is that Monster Beverage has no debt. This means it has been running its business utilising funding from only its equity capital, which is rather impressive. Investors’ risk associated with debt is virtually non-existent with MNST, and the company has plenty of headroom and ability to raise debt should it need to in the future.Given zero long-term debt on its balance sheet, Monster Beverage has no solvency issues, which is used to describe the company’s ability to meet its long-term obligations. However, another measure of financial health is its short-term obligations, which is known as liquidity. These include payments to suppliers, employees and other stakeholders. With current liabilities at US$614m, it seems that the business has maintained a safe level of current assets to meet its obligations, with the current ratio last standing at 2.98x. For Beverage companies, this ratio is within a sensible range since there is a bit of a cash buffer without leaving too much capital in a low-return environment.MNST has zero debt in addition to ample cash to cover its short-term commitments. Its strong balance sheet reduces risk for the company and shareholders. I admit this is a fairly basic analysis for MNST’s financial health. Other important fundamentals need to be considered alongside. I recommend you continue to research Monster Beverage to get a more holistic view of the stock by looking at:Future Outlook: What are well-informed industry analysts predicting for MNST’s future growth?

They generate significant returns for investors to justify their large fees and they allocate a lot of time and employ a complex analysis to determine the best stocks to invest in. A particularly interesting group of stocks that hedge funds like is the small-caps. The huge amount of capital does not allow hedge funds to invest a lot in small-caps, but our research showed that their most popular small-cap ideas are less efficiently priced and generate stronger returns than their large- and mega-cap picks and the broader market. That is why we follow the hedge fund activity in the small-cap space.Is Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST) worth your attention right now? Money managers are getting more optimistic. The number of long hedge fund bets rose by 5 lately. Our calculations also showed that MNST isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds. MNST was in 32 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of September. There were 27 hedge funds in our database with MNST positions at the end of the previous quarter.Why do we pay any attention at all to hedge fund sentiment? Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 18 percentage points since May 2014 through December 3, 2018 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 24% through December 3, 2018. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.Let's analyze the fresh hedge fund action encompassing Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST).Heading into the fourth quarter of 2018, a total of 32 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of 19% from the previous quarter. On the other hand, there were a total of 33 hedge funds with a bullish position in MNST at the beginning of this year. So, let's review which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.Of the funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Neal C. Bradsher's Broadwood Capital has the largest position in Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST), worth close to $278.2 million, comprising 25.8% of its total 13F portfolio. Sitting at the No. 2 spot is Tybourne Capital Management, led by Eashwar Krishnan, holding a $226 million position; the fund has 9.7% of its 13F portfolio invested in the stock. Remaining hedge funds and institutional investors that hold long positions consist of John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors, D. E. Shaw's D E Shaw and Jim Simons's Renaissance Technologies.As aggregate interest increased, key hedge funds have jumped into Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST) headfirst. Stevens Capital Management, managed by Matthew Tewksbury, assembled the largest position in Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST). Stevens Capital Management had $9.2 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital also made a $6.7 million investment in the stock during the quarter. The other funds with new positions in the stock are Paul Tudor Jones's Tudor Investment Corp, Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, and Jeffrey Talpins's Element Capital Management.Let's check out hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST). These stocks are Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NYSE:KDP), Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), and State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT). This group of stocks' market values are closest to MNST's market value.[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position KDP,25,898629,5 MCO,35,5872297,5 TRI,24,391841,10 STT,35,1268343,-1 Average,29.75,2107778,4.75 [/table]View table here if you experience formatting issues.As you can see these stocks had an average of 29.75 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $2.11 billion. That figure was $1.21 billion in MNST's case. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) is the least popular one with only 24 bullish hedge fund positions. Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. This is a slightly positive signal but we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. In this regard MCO might be a better candidate to consider a long position.Disclosure: None.

The innovative beverage company played a vital role in creating a whole new category of drinks, and it has held onto its leadership role in the energy-drink space for years. Yet as Monster grew from a tiny, fast-growing small-cap stock to a big player in the beverage business, shareholders have had to get used to seeing growth rates decline and opportunities for significant expansion become more difficult to find.Coming into Wednesday's second-quarter financial report, Monster Beverage investors still wanted to see double-digit growth rates in sales and profits, and the company was able to deliver on that score. Yet Monster's numbers also reveal some ongoing areas in which it hasn't yet found permanent solutions to maximize its full potential. Until it does, some investors won't be satisfied even with solid performance.Image source: Monster.Monster Beverage's second-quarter results were very much in line with expectations. Net sales were higher by 13% to $1.02 billion, matching the consensus forecast among those following the stock. Similarly, net income climbed 21% to $270.1 million, matching last quarter's growth rate. The resulting earnings of $0.48 per share topped what investors had expected to see by $0.01 per share.As we've seen before, Monster's legacy energy drink division was much stronger than some of its other businesses. For the core unit, sales were higher by 14%. By contrast, the company saw a 7% decline in revenue in its strategic brands division, which is where Monster reports the results of the brands that it got from Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) as part of their broader strategic partnership. Even when you account for some revisions related to changes in accounting rules, strategic brands only managed a 1.5% rise, showing the relative lack of importance for the former Coke part of Monster's portfolio. Other revenue was higher by 7%, contributing just a tiny amount to overall gains.International growth played an outsized role for Monster, which saw an 18.5% rise in sales overseas. Higher promotional activity once again hit gross margin hard, causing a drop of more than three percentage points to 61.1%. Among other items, Monster said that higher prices for aluminum cans played a role in margin deterioration. Case volume soared 13% to 110 million, but net sales per case were down $0.10 to $9.17.CEO Rodney Sacks celebrated Monster's milestone in seeing quarterly revenue top the $1 billion mark. ""We continue to progress our strategic alignment with the Coca-Cola system bottlers,"" Sacks noted as he did last quarter, and the CEO pointed to product launches in areas like Belarus, Tanzania, Uruguay, and key cities in India as helping to drive future growth.Monster sees plenty of further growth potential. Arkansas should complete its transition to Coca-Cola bottlers this quarter, and the July launch of Monster Energy in Ecuador is just the first of several international launches that the company is planning for the remainder of 2018.Stock repurchase activity sped up for Monster. Buybacks added up to 10.6 million, with Monster paying $553.2 million for an average share price of $52.42. With another brand new $500 million authorization for further buybacks, Monster investors can expect the rapid pace of repurchases to continue into the future.Yet Monster Beverage shareholders haven't been satisfied with how the company has done lately, and today was no different, with the stock dropping 4% in after-hours trading following the announcement. To move forward more aggressively, Monster needs to figure out how to get more value out of the legacy Coke brands in its portfolio while reawakening faster growth rates for its most popular Monster brands. If it can do so, then the rest of 2018 could bring a clearer recovery for Monster Beverage's business.

Per the rating firm, the company’s streamlining efforts have concentrated its geographic footprint and helped Citigroup in making its business more durable with increased focus on institutional clients and consumer base.Sustaining strong consumer and institutional asset quality, Citigroup’s financials improved after Moody’s upgraded its rating outlook to positive in November 2017. Notably, the U.S. tax reform also benefited the firm leading to a higher return on equity, diminishing shareholder pressure to an extent.Per Moody's, Citigroup faces tremendous competition in various key businesses, including retail banking and credit cards in the United States, as well as capital markets worldwide. The bank is striving hard to improve returns for its shareholders.Notably, on the cost front, Citigroup targets $2.8 billion in cost savings through 2020 to invest in technology and bringing down efficiency ratio to nearly 53%. Moreover, consumer banking in North America and Mexico along with equity markets and securities services is expected to witness a recovery.Overall, according to Moody's, Citigroup is well placed among competitors with its strategic streamlining efforts and unique global consumer strategy along with revised institutional strategy, which targets high-profile clients worldwide. This leads to steady earnings and huge deposits base.Citigroup currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

A number of Fed speakers will be closely watched this week ahead of a December 18-19 meeting where the Federal Open Market Committee is expected to hike rates by another 25 basis points.As the Fed continues to search for neutral, market commentators are starting to look to the next chapter of monetary policy, which New York Fed President John Williams describes as the “third phase.” Post-accommodation, the Fed will likely be focused on maintaining the neutral rate where GDP growth is moving in line with potential output growth, the unemployment rate levels off, and inflation stabilizes around the 2% goal.“Unfortunately, in the real world, things never seem to play out that way,” Morgan Stanley said.Here’s how Morgan Stanley sees it playing out:In 2019, a one-off tax refund season jolts spending and savings but the “hangover” from fiscal stimulus fades as Fed rate hikes further tighten financial conditions. Compared to GDP growth of 3.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018, economic growth slows to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019 as part of a “growth correction.”But by the end of 2019, the healthy wage growth and strong consumer spending push the unemployment rate down from 3.7% in 2018 to 3.4% in 2019 as wage growth accelerates from 3.1% in 2018 to 3.5% by year-end 2019. Inflation also jumps, as core PCE rises to 2.3% by the end of 2019, up from 2.0% as of the latest reading in September.As a result, the Fed eases financial conditions through four rate hikes in order to curb growth in 2020.“The Fed is caught playing catch-up to an overheating economy,” Morgan Stanley writes.The final prediction: The economy enters a stall in the business cycle where there is a 30% chance of a recession.The trigger? Not household credit or risk in the financial system, but non-financial corporate leverage, which Morgan Stanley describes as the “biggest threat to the economy currently.”With higher interest rates and deteriorating credit quality, Morgan Stanley and a number of other economists — such as former Fed Chair Janet Yellen — worry that leveraged lending could present systemic risk to the economy if an event forces widespread losses.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the banking industry and the intersection of finance and policy for Yahoo Finance.

Just a day earlier, in preparation for Netflix’s quarterly earnings report Tuesday, Morgan Stanley had cut the price target for the first time in three months, to $450 a share from $480.The third-quarter outperformance “reminds us that the long-term trend is clear,” analysts including Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a note, saying Netflix reported almost 1 million more net paid additions than they had expected.Expansion into new program genres like self-produced romantic comedies and unscripted TV, as well as growth in new geographies like India and broader Asia, suggests 2019 could be even better, the analysts added, reiterating their outperform recommendation.To contact the reporters on this story: Joe Easton in London at jeaston7@bloomberg.net;James Cone in London at jcone@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Beth Mellor at bmellor@bloomberg.net, Tom Lavell, Blaise RobinsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2018 Bloomberg L.P.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

Rooney previously oversaw technology and served as the firm's head of Europe, Middle East, Africa. He will move to New York in his new seat. Clare Woodman, formerly the global chief operating officer for the bank's institutional securities group, is set to replace Rooney's role in EMEA.Here's the memo:Given the rapid pace of technological change and the ever increasing importance of technology in both furthering our business leadership and protecting our Firm and our clients, I am grateful that Rob has agreed to make Technology his sole focus. Over the last two years, Rob has overseen Technology while also serving as Head of EMEA, two critical roles. During his time heading our EMEA business, he has helped the Firm navigate the complex Brexit process, and we thank him for that. MSRooney's sole focus on tech signals the bank is making it a bigger focus, a person familiar with the matter told Business Insider. Rooney will be focusing on ""artificial intelligence, automation, cybersecurity and digital,"" the memo said.Rooney will report to Gorman, the memo said.Notably,  the New York bank had a killer first quarter. The bank reported adjusted earnings of $1.45 a share, a 45% increase from last year and well ahead of analyst expectations of $1.28 a share.Particularly striking was the bank's results in fixed-income, a business unit in trading it once left for dead. The bank posted its best results in the unit in three years. In 2015, it took an axe to fixed-income,  cutting 25% of its workforce, replacing its leadership, and slashing bonuses.NOW WATCH: A $163 billion chief economist outlines his biggest market fearSee Also:MORGAN STANLEY: Here's where cryptocurrencies are traded around the globeWall Street's Tesla bulls are in troubleNorth and South Korea are inching closer to peace — and it could have as big an impact on markets as the fall of the Berlin WallSEE ALSO: Morgan Stanley's youngest bankers could be getting a 25% pay raiseTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsAccording to Dimon we're ten years off that outcome, but experts say it won't look great when it gets here.These stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.“I hope to be able to collect an annual income of around $75,000 per year from my 401(k), plus the $36,000 per year in Social Security.”Faster growth in 2024 and beyond, thanks to a massive addressable market, could send shares of this tech giant higher.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.All may not be what it seems for the U.S. economy and stock market.Underwood answered a random call for chili peppers from the man who'd go on to became California's sriracha mogul.

Exchanges are the venues on which cryptocurrencies trade and the biggest can see daily trading volumes in the billions.The investment bank's research shows that the majority of volumes flow, at least nominally, through Malta. This is largely down to Binance, one of the biggest exchanges in the world, recently announcing plans to shift its legal headquarters to the small European island.""The largest exchange called Binance announced intentions to set up headquarters there, so if we take that company out, Malta would be much further down the list,"" Shah and her team wrote.""Binance said that it was moving away from Asia (currently registered in Hong Kong) due to more stringent regulation, especially from Japan. The third-largest exchange, OKEx, also recently announced that it was opening an office in Malta as the government markets itself as ""Blockchain Island"".""While Malta dominates when it comes to volumes, the United Kingdom is actually the location of the largest number of exchanges — although the UK accounts for just 1% of global trading volumes, Morgan Stanley notes.Morgan Stanley""Most are in the UK, Hong Kong and the US,"" Shah and her team note. ""The three countries have relatively large financial centres and the US has a technology focus in Silicon Valley.""There are six exchanges located in India but many are likely to have to shut down or relocate as this month the central bank ordered commercial banks to close accounts with exchanges.""Cryptocurrency exchanges have come under increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide as more and more money as flowed into the sector over the last year. While some countries such as India and the US have sought to crackdown on the activity, countries and territories such as Switzerland, Gibraltar, and Malta have sought to attract the nascent industry to their shores.""The blockchain and cryptocurrency industry is growing rapidly and can have economic benefits for a particular country through the creation of start-ups (good for jobs), research and development and financial transactions,"" Shah and team write. ""Governments are having to consider their regulatory stance quickly.""""Defined but also attractive regulation makes an exchange decide to choose one country over another – a set of laws for companies to follow when handling digital tokens, customer assets, AML policies, taxes, etc. Regulatory certainty is part of the attractiveness for the companies so they can plan for the future as they know what to expect.

(NYSE: CRM) acquired MuleSoft in early 2018 in a $6.5-billion deal that wasn't fully appreciated by the Street, according to Morgan Stanley.The AnalystMorgan Stanley's Keith Weiss maintained an Overweight rating on salesforce with a price target lifted from $153 to $178.The ThesisSalesforce's acquisition of MuleSoft addresses the company's challenge of connecting and utilizing data more efficiently from the legacy platform towards saleforce's platform, Weiss said in a research report.The acquisition is also intended to expand salesforce's value proposition as a broader public and private hybrid cloud environment, the analyst said. The deal comes at a time when digital transformation is a top priority among chief information officers, especially in the areas of customer service, marketing and sales, he said.Under salesforce's umbrella, MuleSoft should generate more than $1 billion by 2021 given an estimated market opportunity of more than $25 billion, Weiss said.On the other hand, MuleSoft is unlikely to report an operating income profit until fiscal 2022, and the acquisition is unlikely to be accretive to salesforce's free cash flow until 2023 and to EPS the following year, the analyst said.If salesforce achieves better-than-expected acquisition-related synergies, the stock could move higher by more than 50 percent from current levels to $223 per share, Weiss said.Price ActionShares of salesforce were trading 1.1 percent higher to $146.05 at the time of publication Tuesday.Related Links:Wall Street Reacts To Salesforce's .5-Billion Mulesoft AcquisitionBernstein's Bearish Stance On Salesforce No Longer AppliesPhoto courtesy of salesforce.Latest Ratings for CRMAug 2018Morgan StanleyMaintainsOverweightOverweightJul 2018Stifel NicolausMaintainsBuyBuyJul 2018Stifel NicolausMaintainsBuyBuyView More Analyst Ratings for CRM  View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaKeyBanc Downgrades Dycom After Guidance Cut, Awaits Revenue Re-AccelerationSwitch's Guidance Shortfall Prompts JPMorgan DowngradeKeyBanc: CFO's Retirement To Cause 'Minimal Disruption' At Netflix© 2018 Benzinga.com.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) — a steady presence in southern Asia.The RatingMorgan Stanley's Simeon Gutman and three other analysts maintained an Equal-Weight rating and $99 price target on Wal-Mart and an Overweight rating and $1,700 price target on Amazon.The ThesisThe analysts consider the potential for a Flipkart IPO a “key buffer” for Walmart.”[The] importance of demonstrating progress in Walmart’s U.S. business (particularly e-commerce) has magnified and cannot be understated,” the analysts said in a report.Morgan Stanley is ambivalent as to whether Walmart needs a presence in India.The nation’s $21 billion in e-commerce sales represents just 1 percent of the global addressable market, although Morgan Stanley expects expansion to $200 billion — 12 percent of the worldwide total ― by 2026.“India represents a significant long-term opportunity,” the analysts said.They estimate Flipkart controls nearly double the share of online gross merchandise volume that Amazon does and is in a period of sustained growth. Its leadership in online smartphone sales is particularly notable considering the category accounts for about half of India’s total online sales, although smartphones yield low to negative gross margins.Price ActionAmazon was up 0.29 percent Monday morning, while Walmart was trading higher by 1.16 percent.Related Links:Advantages With India ETFsAmazon Moving Retail Wars To An Unexpected Battleground: Physical StoresLatest Ratings for AMZNMay 2018Telsey Advisory GroupInitiates Coverage OnOutperformApr 2018WedbushMaintainsOutperformOutperformApr 2018BarclaysMaintainsOverweightOverweightView More Analyst Ratings for AMZN  View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaSears Board Explores Sale Of AssetsMike Olson's Bullish Musings On Activision, Amazon And NetflixAnalysis: The Rarity Of A Sub-4% Unemployment Rate© 2018 Benzinga.com.

A Tuesday upgrade boosted Mylan's ratings ratio to 13 Buys and seven Holds.The RatingAnalyst David Risinger raised Mylan from Equal-weight to Overweight and increased the price target from $39 to $50.The ThesisNotably, Mylan is now Morgan Stanley’s only Overweight generic drugs stock.The company recently received regulatory approval for the first of 18 biosimilar candidates, and Risinger said he anticipates increasing market enthusiasm for the pipeline.“We view Mylan as the best-positioned U.S. generics company to capitalize on biosimilars via its industry-leading partnerships with Biocon and Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: MNTA),” Risinger said in a Tuesday note “Biosimilars are often high value, limited competition opportunities.”The rest of the firm’s portfolio compares favorably with those of peers, and Risinger said he sees opportunity to gain U.S. generics market share as competitors endure instability.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (NYSE: TEVA) is restructuring and reducing its workforce; Sandoz Inc is selling its oral generics unit; and Apotex Inc is suffering leadership challenges, according to Morgan Stanley.Amid these circumstances, Risinger said he Mylan’s stock growth to accelerate from 12 percent to 24 percent in the second half of 2018, driven in part by the potential approval of generic Advair and biosimilar Neulasta.Price ActionMylan shares were up more than 5 percent at $43.64 in Tuesday morning trading.Related Links:Teva Vs Mylan: Wells Fargo Weighs InMylan Sharply Lower Amid Drug Price Fixing ConcernsLatest Ratings for MYLMar 2018Morgan StanleyMaintainsOverweightOverweightMar 2018Morgan StanleyUpgradesEqual-WeightOverweightJan 2018Leerink SwannInitiates Coverage OnMarket PerformView More Analyst Ratings for MYL  View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaGordon Johnson: Sell Trinity As 'Rear-View Catalysts' FadePastel Paintings And Landmines: 7 Of The Weirdest Top State ExportsGoldman Sachs Sees 100% Upside In This Biopharma Company© 2018 Benzinga.com.

""This development could enhance US technological leadership and address vulnerabilities in surveillance, mission deployment, cyber, and AI.""Space is already a $350 billion economy, or roughly half a percent of the world's GDP, the bank estimates. And as more investments pour into technologies like reusable rockets that make space exploration cheaper, that economy could grow to $1 trillion, especially as countries recognize the need for a space presence to maintain national security.Still, though, it's not clear how exactly the ""Space Force"" might come about — or even which branch of the current military it may fall under — but Morgan Stanley says it could actually be a net positive for the Department of Defense.""Based on conversations with some Washington insiders, establishing a Space Force as a standalone military branch, while potentially contentious, could be overall beneficial for the US Defense Department,"" said Morgan Stanley.

One Wall Street analyst said it’s still too early to expect a mean reversion bump in underperforming Barrick Gold Corp (USA) (NYSE: ABX).The AnalystMorgan Stanley analyst Piyush Sood downgraded Barrick from Equal-Weight to Underweight and lowered the price target from $14 to $12. Sood upgraded Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE: NEM) and raised the price target from $37 to $40.The ThesisIn the past year, Newmont stock is up 13.7 percent, while Barrick stock is down 19.3 percent.Barrick's underperformance will likely widen even more throughout the remainder of 2018, Sood said in a Tuesday note.“We prefer NEM over ABX, driven by NEM's stronger execution, steadier production profile, deeper and relatively de-risked project pipeline, better reserve life and lower leverage,"" the analyst said.Morgan Stanley forecast gold prices to continue to trade mostly sideways for the rest of the year, a dynamic that favors Newmont over Barrick. In addition, Sood said downside risk to gold prices will hit Barrick harder.Newmont’s falling production from existing mines has been offset by its growth projects, and the company has a long track record of successful investments, the analyst said. At the same time, Barrick’s production from existing mines had been dropping, but the company has chosen to focus on improving its balance sheet rather than investing in new projects, he said.Price ActionNewmont shares were up 0.34 percent at the time of publication Tuesday, while Barrick shares were down 0.53 percent.Related Links:The Overlooked Relationship Between Gold And Bitcoin, ExplainedDoes Bitcoin Actually Hold Any Value At All?Photo by Euyasik/Wikimedia.
