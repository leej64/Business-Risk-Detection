CVS chief medical officer: 'We are not looking to build the entire healthcare delivery ecosystem'`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cvs-chief-medical-officer-we-are-not-looking-to-build-the-entire-healthcare-delivery-ecosystem-164059258.html`2024-02-10 16:40:59`"The role of retail players in healthcare, like CVS (CVS), Walmart (WMT) and now Amazon (AMZN), is being closely watched by investors and clinicians alike.In its latest earnings, CVS emphasized a continued strategy in health services, even as competitor Walgreens (WBA) has signaled a pullback. Through its recent acquisitions of home health provider Signify, and primary care provider for seniors Oak Street, CVS is continuing to look for ways to create a closed loop for patients within its own system.""Oak Street ended the year with 202,000 at risk lives an increase of 27% versus the prior year. Through January, the number of Aetna members enrolled in Oak Street Clinic has doubled,"" said CEO Karen Lynch on the recent earnings call.""Signify completed 649,000 in-home evaluations in the quarter, an increase of 20% versus the same period last year. Among our Aetna customers, we are broadening our addressable market utilizing Signify's strong capabilities in other products, including individual exchange and Medicaid,"" Lynch said.Chief medical officer Sree Chaguturu told Yahoo Finance the company is ""building a world of health around every consumer.""""We are not looking to build the entire health care delivery ecosystem. But where we are choosing to build is where we believe there's the greatest opportunity to improve health outcomes. That's primary care, retail health, home services and physician enablement and accountable care — and that's helping physicians participate in value-based care,"" Chaguturu said in a recent, wide-ranging interview.When asked if those services step on the toes of legacy providers, like hospital systems and physician groups, by taking market share away from less complex cases, Chaguturu said it was the opposite.""These are the most complex patients in our healthcare ecosystem, with multiple chronic diseases, and in addition to the chronic illnesses, many aspects of social fragility and social determinants of need,"" he said.The company's recent earnings beat Wall Street expectations, reporting $93.8 billion in revenue for 2023, compared to an expected $90.7 billion. But it cut its 2024 outlook, expecting an expensive year ahead.That includes increased utilization costs for Aetna Medicare Advantage patients as delayed services from the pandemic continue to come back, and pharmacy benefits managers, like CVS Caremark, becoming a target for lawmakers in Congress who are looking at ways to reduce the power of such ""middlemen."" Typically, such middlemen are blamed for increased costs in the health ecosystem, but Chaguturu says they will help in the rush of use of weight loss drugs.The frenzy over GLP-1s, drugs that have been used for diabetics to help increase insulin production and help slow digestion, have been approved in the past few years for weight loss in obese patients.Though GLP-1s, named for the hormone in the body they mimic, are not new, the latest formulations have had record weight loss results. That has spurred a rush of interest ranging from patients to online health platforms looking to take advantage of the trend by offering prescriptions.Still, according to CVS, 80% of the prescriptions for the four top-selling drugs, from Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), are for Type 2 diabetes patients.Chaguturu said the PBMs will continue to drive down pricing to ensure access for more patients, and expects that more competition — which could begin as early as the end of this year — will also help drive down costs. CVS benefits by earning fees on the prescriptions of the drug it fills, as well as the rebates it gains from the drug manufacturers for covering the drugs and providing access to patients.But it isn't an unfettered gold rush. CVS is working with hesitant customers, like insurers and employers, who worry about the increased costs. The roughly $1,000-per-month GLP-1 drugs have caused some employers and insurers to stop covering them, or to require prior authorization in order to fill the prescription.That includes CVS's own insurer, Aetna, which told Yahoo Finance previously that, ""Prior authorization is required for coverage of these medications. This process allows our clinicians to review the request using evidence-based guidelines to ensure that coverage is appropriate given the member’s clinical status. The prior authorization process may include a review of the member’s age, body mass index, previous medical history and response to previous therapy.""CVS is also building clinical support for the employers and insurers, to ensure patients who get prescriptions actually need them, and then providing support to manage any side effects, according to Chaguturu.He said clients are taking a variety of approaches to GLP-1s, including waiting until prices come down, or until a way to ensure appropriate prescribing is in place, before agreeing to cover them.""In addition to bringing down pricing, we offer coverage and clinical solutions to help employers and health plans have access,"" he said.He expects new competitors on the scene, driving the ability to bring down pricing per prescription and net cost of prescription over the coming years.Anjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

Top 12 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-12-stocks-buy-10-152540880.html`2024-02-10 15:25:40`In this piece, we will take a look at the top 12 stocks to buy in 10 different sectors for the next 3 months. If you want to skip our introduction to how spreading a portfolio across several sectors might help long term performance according to financial literature, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months.The spread of technology and the broad use of the Internet by people belonging to all walks of life has significantly increased the exposure that people have to information. This is true for politics, sports, and finance - as both those who work in these industries and others whose well being is tied to their performance are able to stay abreast with the latest developments. Social media stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and private companies like Elon Musk's well known X (formerly called Twitter) enable a connected world and a much well informed global populace.For instance, if you're interested to learn from those who spend the better part of their day dabbling in all things finance, then you can always consult Twitter. Diverse viewpoints are important when it comes to risking money on stocks, and another common way of hedging an investment portfolio's risk is through diversification as well. In finance theory, diversification reduces the variance that a broader portfolio's returns might face. In other words, it reduces the wild downswings that might significantly reduce principal value in case of an untoward event in one industry, providing investors with peace of mind and better chances of optimal cardiovascular performance.Additionally, the sheer plethora of information available to investors through the Internet and traditional media also allows them to rapidly tailor and trim their investments in response to news. For instance, it takes mere seconds for all major stock indexes such as the NASDAQ, the S&P 500, and the NYSE to fall when the Federal Reserve surprises investors by beefing up interest rates, or rise when macroeconomic and political stability is assured. When it comes to investing in stocks that belong to different sectors, a well-informed investor is easily able to keep up to date with the performance of sectors that are completely different from each other such as high technology biotechnology stocks and good old oil crude oil exploration and production stocks.Even if we were to ignore complex mathematical complications of standard deviation and other variables that professionals rely on when investing in stocks in different sectors, doing so also seems to make sense on an intuitive scale. For instance, let's consider two different sectors and recent stock market events to see how this might work. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and the Federal Reserve started to increase interest rates in response to record inflation levels, the bifurcation of the stock market into different sectors became clear. We've briefly mentioned one of these, i.e., oil and energy, above, and the second sector is technology. After the Russian invasion and the official settling in of the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate hiking cycle, oil stocks soared as investors correctly realized that they would benefit from a shakeup in the global oil industry.At the same time, tight macroeconomic conditions created by high interest rates and high inflation meant that big ticket technology and high growth stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted double or even triple digit percentage losses on the stock market. For the investor who was prudent enough to have invested in different sectors at the start of 2022, the juicy returns and dividends offered by oil stocks would have helped ease or even reverse the pain that technology stocks experienced in 2022.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top stocks in different sectors. The notable picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Photo by Sunrise King on UnsplashOur Methodology To make our list of the stocks to buy in different sectors, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge fund portfolios and picked out stocks from Technology, Materials, Real Estate, Financial Services, Healthcare, Industrial, Communications, Consumer Cyclical, Consumer Defensive, Utilities, and Energy sectors with the highest hedge fund shareholders as of Q3 2023.

Do Its Financials Have Any Role To Play In Driving Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Stock Up Recently?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/financials-role-play-driving-amazon-120024420.html`2024-02-10 12:00:24`"Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 22% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Amazon.com's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Amazon.com The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:15% = US$30b ÷ US$202b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit.We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.To begin with, Amazon.com seems to have a respectable ROE. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 19% does temper our expectations. However, the moderate 5.7% net income growth seen by Amazon.com over the past five years is definitely a positive. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the fairly high earnings growth seen by the company.As a next step, we compared Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 13% in the same period.Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is AMZN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether AMZN is currently mispriced by the market.Amazon.com doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.Overall, we feel that Amazon.com certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a respectable rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.
