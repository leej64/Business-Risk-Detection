To keep it practical, we’ll show how 3M Company’s (NYSE:MMM) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Based on the last twelve months, 3M’s P/E ratio is 25.97. That means that at current prices, buyers pay $25.97 for every $1 in trailing yearly profits.  Check out our latest analysis for 3M  The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for 3M:P/E of 25.97 = $198.37 ÷ $7.64 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2018.)A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it’s better to pay a low price — but as Warren Buffett said, ‘It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.’When earnings fall, the ‘E’ decreases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others — and that may encourage shareholders to sell.3M’s earnings per share fell by 17% in the last twelve months. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 2.9%. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 1.1% per year over the last three years. This growth rate might warrant a low P/E ratio. This might lead to low expectations.The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that 3M has a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the industrials industry average (26.5).That indicates that the market expects 3M will perform roughly in line with other companies in its industry. So if 3M actually outperforms its peers going forward, that should be a positive for the share price. Checking factors such as the tenure of the board and management could help you form your own view on if that will happen.The ‘Price’ in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.3M’s net debt is 9.8% of its market cap. So it doesn’t have as many options as it would with net cash, but its debt would not have much of an impact on its P/E ratio.3M trades on a P/E ratio of 26, which is above the US market average of 17.9. With some debt but no EPS growth last year, the market has high expectations of future profits.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. People often underestimate remarkable growth — so investors can make money when fast growth is not fully appreciated.

One reason being its ‘too big to fail’ aura which gives it the appearance of a strong and stable investment. However, the health of the financials determines whether the company continues to succeed. Today we will look at 3M’s financial liquidity and debt levels, which are strong indicators for whether the company can weather economic downturns or fund strategic acquisitions for future growth. Remember this is a very top-level look that focuses exclusively on financial health, so I recommend a deeper analysis into MMM here. View our latest analysis for 3MMMM’s debt levels surged from US$11.70B to US$14.01B over the last 12 months , which is made up of current and long term debt. With this increase in debt, MMM’s cash and short-term investments stands at US$4.13B , ready to deploy into the business. Additionally, MMM has produced US$6.24B in operating cash flow in the last twelve months, leading to an operating cash to total debt ratio of 44.54%, meaning that MMM’s operating cash is sufficient to cover its debt. This ratio can also be interpreted as a measure of efficiency as an alternative to return on assets. In MMM’s case, it is able to generate 0.45x cash from its debt capital.At the current liabilities level of US$7.69B liabilities, the company has been able to meet these commitments with a current assets level of US$14.28B, leading to a 1.86x current account ratio. Usually, for Industrials companies, this is a suitable ratio as there’s enough of a cash buffer without holding too capital in low return investments.3M is a highly levered company given that total debt exceeds equity. This isn’t surprising for large-caps, as equity can often be more expensive to issue than debt, plus interest payments are tax deductible. Consequently, larger-cap organisations tend to enjoy lower cost of capital as a result of easily attained financing, providing an advantage over smaller companies. No matter how high the company’s debt, if it can easily cover the interest payments, it’s considered to be efficient with its use of excess leverage. As a rule of thumb, a company should have earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of at least three times the size of net interest. For MMM, the ratio of 22.31x suggests that interest is amply covered. Large-cap investments like MMM are often believed to be a safe investment due to their ability to pump out ample earnings multiple times its interest payments.Although MMM’s debt level is towards the higher end of the spectrum, its cash flow coverage seems adequate to meet obligations which means its debt is being efficiently utilised. This may mean this is an optimal capital structure for the business, given that it is also meeting its short-term commitment. This is only a rough assessment of financial health, and I’m sure MMM has company-specific issues impacting its capital structure decisions.

These rewards, approved by the board of directors, have aided the company’s share price to gain 0.7% yesterday.We believe that such disbursements reflect 3M’s shareholder-friendly policies and strong cash position. Details of Share Buyback & Quarterly DividendUnder the new buyback program, 3M was allowed to repurchase shares of up to $10 billion. This program will replace the company’s existing share buyback programs.Additionally, the company declared that it has been authorized to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $1.36 per share to shareholders of record as of Nov 23. The payment, pertaining to the fourth quarter of 2018, will be made this year on Dec 12. Sound Capital-Allocation Strategies3M uses free resources for strengthening its growth prospects and rewarding shareholders through share buybacks, and dividend payments.Over the last five years (2013-2017), 3M’s annual dividend payments increased from $2.54 in 2013 to $4.70 in 2017. In the first three quarters of 2018, the company distributed a dividend of $4.08 per share. It’s worth noting here that the quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 16% in January 2018.Regarding share buybacks, the company repurchased $3.6 billion worth of shares in the first three quarters of 2018. It had $1.5 billion authorization left in its $10-billion buyback program approved in February 2016.For 2018, 3M anticipates repurchasing shares worth $4-$5 billion. Our TakeWe believe that improvement in profitability and strong cash position will enable 3M to return higher value to shareholders in the years ahead. In the third quarter of 2018, the company’s net income increased 8% year over year. Further, its cash and cash equivalents were $3,185 million exiting the period.For 2018, 3M now anticipates earnings of $9.90-$10.00 per share, with the mid-point reflecting year-over-year growth of 8.5%. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWith a market capitalization of $115.5 billion, 3M currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Solid product offerings, expanding geographical footprints and restructuring initiatives will benefit the company. However, inflation in input prices and high-interest expenses remain major concerns.In the past three months, the company’s share price has decreased 1.5% compared with 9% decline recorded by the industry.Moreover, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share declined 3.1% to $10.02 for 2018 and 3.2% to $10.89 for 2019.3M Company Price and Consensus 3M Company Price and Consensus | 3M Company QuoteSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Macquarie Infrastructure Company MIC, Crane Company CR and Federal Signal Corporation FSS.

On February 20, 2018, the Company and the State of Minnesota announced that they have reached a resolution to end the State's lawsuit against 3M. The state had sued the Company for $5 billion and alleged that drinking water in several east Twin Cities suburbs was contaminated due to disposal of perfluorochemicals (PFCs) over the last fifty plus years adversely impacting the health of people.

This morning, 3M most recent news is on our radar and our team decided to put out a fantastic report on the company that is now available for free below:www.active-investors.com/registration-sg/?symbol=MMM PFC's were used by 3M once to make Scotchgard fabric protector and other products. Research indicates that PFCs are linked to increased risks of cancer, thyroid disease, fertility issues, liver damage, and impacts on growth and learning in children. The settlement was announced by Lori Swanson, Minnesota's Attorney General (AG).Agreement between 3M and State of MinnesotaAs per the terms of the settlement between 3M and the State, both parties have agreed to work together and invest in environment and community. Accordingly, 3M has agreed to provide a $850 million grant to the State for a special fund called - ""3M Grant for Water Quality and Sustainability Fund"". This fund is expected to support water sustainability projects in the Twin Cities East Metro region. This could include projects related to the reduction of PFCs in the environment and to the enhancement of groundwater sustainability. The fund also plans to support projects which encourage and result in habitat and recreation improvements, such as fishing piers, trails, and open space preservation.The Company has also shared that the settlement and related legal fees will negatively impact Company's EPS for Q1 2018 by approximately $1.10 to $1.15 per share.Commenting on the matter, John Banovetz, Senior VP - Research & Development and CTO with 3M, said:""We are proud of our record of environmental stewardship, and while we do not believe there is a PFC-related public health issue, 3M will work with the State on these important projects. Sustainability is embedded firmly at the core of our business. This settlement reflects our commitment to acting with integrity and conducting business in a sustainable way that is in the best interest of all who live and work in Minnesota.""AG Swanson was pleased with the settlement and stated:""We think the settlement will help solve a problem for Minnesota. It's a problem that's been a long time in the making for many decades. These chemicals as I mentioned were put into the ground and we are very hopeful that this settlement can help fix that.""The LawsuitThe lawsuit against 3M was filed in 2010 for contamination of the fish and waterways in Minnesota and later morphed into a case of 3M being held responsible for causing health risks for the residents of the state, especially in the East Twin Cities Metro region.The AG alleged that the Company's use and disposal of petro-fluorochemicals (PFCs) since the 1950's had contaminated the water supplies in East Twin Cities Metro region leading to health problems for the people drinking the contaminated water. 3M owns the patent for PFCs and used them in the manufacture of products like Teflon brand non-stick cookware and Scotchguard stain repellants. The Company had been disposing these chemicals legally at different landfills in the Twin Cities suburbs of Oakdale, Woodbury and Lake Elmo till the 1970s. The Company stopped making PFCs in early 2000s. The AG believed that the Company continued disposing the chemicals with full knowledge that the groundwater could be contaminated with PFCs and would increase health hazards like cancer and infertility amongst the residents in the region. It is estimated that approximately 67,000 consumed the contaminated water in the affected area.Although 3M conceded that the presence of PFCs is widespread it claimed that they were harmless and only caused disease in laboratory animals in ""ultra-high concentrations"". The Company completely denied the AGs allegations that it was knowingly covering up the health risks of PFCs. The Company referred to a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) studies that show PFCs in someone's blood does not necessarily mean their health will be impacted.The case which has been delayed for a long time and was further delayed after a report by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) in February 07, 2018, said that drinking water contaminated by 3M apparently has not caused higher rates of cancer or low birth weights in parts of Washington County compared to the rest of the state. The case was headed for a jury selection of February 20, 2018, when in a dramatic turn, the Company announced the settlement with the State.This is not the end of the matter for 3M as it still faces similar lawsuits related to PFCs across the country.About 3M Co.St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M is a global science Company that never stops inventing. The Company has 46 technology platforms, ranging from adhesives and abrasives, to ceramics and nanotechnology. The Company has $30 billion in sales and offices across over 70 countries.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Wal-Mart (WMT), 3M (MMM) and Union Pacific (UNP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Buy-rated Wal-Mart’s shares have been strong performers lately, with the stock up +32.1% over the last six months, outperforming the S&P 500's +13.3% gain in the same time period. Wal-Mart Stores, recently announced plans to drop the “hyphen” and “stores” from its name to officially emerge as an omnichannel retailer. The company has been riding on its robust past record, which derives strength from constant e-commerce initiatives, like buyouts, alliances, surging grocery business and improved delivery systems. Thanks to these trends, along with solid traffic, Walmart’s third-quarter fiscal 2018 marked its ninth and 13th straight quarter of positive earnings surprise and comps growth, respectively. Also, the company’s international business remains a growth driver. However, costs associated with technological and e-commerce investments; mix impact from growing e-commerce operations and a compelling pricing strategy have been hurting Walmart’s gross margin for a while now. Stiff competition and volatile consumer spending also pose threats.(You can read the full research report on Wal-Mart here >>>).Shares of Buy-rated 3M have gained +11.8% over the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which has gained +1.9% over the same period. The Zacks analyst likes 3M's global footprint, diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate different markets. Moreover, 3M is continuing with its portfolio restructuring efforts by divesting assets that no longer fit in its strategy and continues to make investments in other lucrative markets. Portfolio management, investment in innovation and business transformation are the three key levers on which 3M intends to focus. 3M also intends to continue investing in capital expenditures and R&D to support organic growth as it aims a prudent capital structure strategy and increased capital deployment. Furthermore, 3M is standardizing its business processes through a new, global ERP system and expects to save $500 to $700 million annually by 2020. However, high pension expenses continue to be a drag on the company’s bottom line.(You can read the full research report on 3M here >>>).Buy-rated Union Pacific’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Rail industry as well as fellow railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corporation over the last six months. While Union Pacific has gained 29.5%, the industry it belongs to and Norfolk Southern have rallied 15.5% and 25%, respectively, in the same time period. The Zacks analyst expects volume growth to aid Union Pacific's results in the fourth quarter of 2017. Key segments like intermodal and chemicals should drive growth. Detailed results should be out on Jan 25. The company's efforts to reward shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payouts are also impressive. Its efforts to cut costs to drive its bottom line are encouraging too. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be made out from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised 0.7% upward over the last 60 days. However, declining automotive volumes and high debt levels are concerns.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here >>>).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Humana (HUM), Southern (SO) and Western Duke Energy (DUK).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

I’m Rebekah Mintzer, Law.com’s in-house editor, and I’m very pleased to be bringing you another week’s worth of legal department news and insights. In this edition, we’ll talk about the newest venture from UnitedLex, a legal services provider with a reputation for splashy projects—though the in-house experts we spoke to had mixed opinions about how effective the venture would be. Plus, it was a big week for GC moves, but one attorney is taking on a position that most job seekers would probably avoid like the plague. Read on to find out more... If you have tips, story ideas or other feedback, email me at rmintzer@alm.com or find me on Twitter: @rmintzer.When UnitedLex talks, the legal industry tends to listen. So it was with the service provider’s total redesign of DXC Technology’s legal department announced late last year, and again last week when UnitedLex revealed it is partnering with LeClair Ryan to form “ULex Partners.” The new platform will allow law firms to outsource their non-legal operations and benefit from UnitedLex technologies and the ability to access investor funds for new legal technologies. It’s also supposed to improve corporate client service. But do in-house experts see this as a plus? In-House reporter Sue Reisingerasked some of her sources what they thought. She found that feedback was mixed. Color Me Skeptical. Former GE general counsel and current Goodwin Procterpartner Brackett Denniston said he doesn’t think this announcement is the great disruptor that some have said it could be—more just a “broader expansion” of existing outsourcing practices. “UnitedLex is not a secret. It’s not hard to find them.And you don’t have to go to LeClairRyan to locate them,” he told Sue. Thomas Sager, former GC at DuPont, who is now at BallardSpahr, didn’t sing the new project’s praises either. In his view, it should be the role of the corporate client—not the law firm—to oversee the performance of legal service providers like UnitedLex. He said law firms generally “don’t have the business discipline” to manage these engagements well. But Wait….DXC’s Bill Deckelman pointed out some of the venture’s advantages. He said that with ULex Partners, law firms can focus on the work for their clients that really matters, which should make legal departments happy. “At the same time, UnitedLex can significantly enhance the law firm’s client service capabilities through leverage of UnitedLex’s technology, process design and project management discipline,” he added.This week, Sue Reisinger also got the inside scoop on how a company that seems to make every type of product under the sun, The 3M Company, also manages to undertake some great pro bono work around the world. Tone from the Top. It helps if the top legal boss is enthusiastic about a pro bono project, and Ivan Fong, 3M’s general counsel, certainly is. Fong, who oversees 260 in-house lawyers around the world, calls pro bono one of the most “fun and rewarding”activities his department carries out. “Pro bono work exposes legal professionals to new areas of law, and sharpens their legal analysis and client communication skills,” Fong told Sue. Solid Partnerships. 3M makes its pro bono program run with a little help from its friends, which include law firms like Hogan Lovells and Dentons and nonprofit groups like the Legal Aid Society and the International Refugee Assistance Project. In total, 3M works with 20 outside groups to make pro bono happen. Harrowing Tales. Through pro bono, the company’s in-house lawyers have gotten involved in some pretty dramatic legal battles. One 3M compliance counsel shared how he worked with a Syrian college student who was shot and tortured by the government there and had to flee. The lawyer worked to win residency for the student in Germany.In-house leaders are moving up in the world, and getting recognized (rightfully) for what they can contribute to the C-suite. With newfound power comes the growing need for sound advice from peers. In-house reporter Caroline Spiezio recently attended a conference at Stanford University and gathered wise words from the many in-house attorneys from major companies speaking there. Here are some pointers she picked up: ➤ Really “get” what the business does. Just knowing a company’s legal work isn’t going to cut it anymore--knowing the business, products and services, is essential for in-house success. “Once you’ve taken the time to understand how the pieces fit together it can be really powerful because it will buy you credibility with people who might not listen to you,” said Anthony Falzone, deputy general counsel at Pinterest. ➤ Travel as much as you can. Don’t just stay at HQ....Eleanor Lacey, general counsel at Sophos, said that visiting different offices and places where the company operated scored her plenty of points with colleagues and employees. “It was amazing to me how at a senior level [visiting] just seemed to buy me a lot of credibility,” she said.Monday, June 25- Friday, June 29. Global Leaders in Law will hold its Mini MBA for GCs in Oxford, UK. GLL is an invitation-only membership group, offering GCs a global platform for in-person collaboration to exchange ideas and receive advice and guidance from peers. For more information, contact Meena Heath at mheath@alm.com. Tuesday, July 10. Questions of building a harassment and discrimination-free culture have perhaps never been more urgent for legal departments. The New York City Barwill hold an event Shaping Corporate Culture: Best Practices for In-House Counsel in the Wake of #MeToo. Panelists include counsel from J. Crew and Hogan Lovells. Thursday, September 13-Friday September 14. Prominent in-house lawyers willmeet to discuss disruption and the changing role of GCs at Corporate Counsel Forum Europe 2018. The conference, which is co-chaired by two prominent general counsel, Sabine Chalmers of BT and Phillip Bramwell of BAE, will take place in the U.K. at Pennyhill Park, Surrey.A Dream Job? Probably Not. Normally, when a GC makes it to the CEO spot, it’s something to celebrate. But emotions may be more mixed for David Taylor of troubled Theranos, who was promoted late last week after his former boss, CEO Elizabeth Holmes was indicted for fraud. Taylor, who joined the company from Munger Tolles & Olson in 2016 and quickly stepped up to become its acting general counsel, now has to try to make things right for Theranos from the very top of the corporate ladder. Best of luck, David. IP to the Top. In Silicon Valley, heading up the IP side of the legal department can position you for a bigger step someday. Take Dana Rao, the brand new GC at Adobe Systems. The software company announced this week that it had promoted Rao to replace former legal leader Mike Dillon. Rao has been Adobe’s vice president and associate general counsel of intellectual property and litigation since April 2012. Learning the Ropes. Last week, a source close to Bain Capital informed Law.com that the firm is getting a new managing director and general counsel—Christopher Green, who is currently a partner at Ropes & Gray. Green replaces Ropes & Gray alum Sean Doherty, who is leaving Bain after 13 years as head of legal there. Green Is currently co-lead of his law firm’s global private equity and hedge fund SEC enforcement and litigation group. He will begin his transition into the job Sept. 1. Closing on a New Job. Professional services and investment and real estate management company Jones Lang LaSalle has a brand new global GC and corporate secretary. Alan Tse succeeds retiring Mark Ohringer, and will take over in the job June 27. He comes from Petco, where he became GC in 2016. Previously, he was general counsel at Churchill Downs, the company behind the famous Kentucky Derby. Sold! A longtime lawyer at Christie’s auction house, Martin Wilson, is moving on to the rival auction house Phillips.

The London-based attorney will lead Phillips’ global legal and compliance functions and also play an active role in top client business development and dealmaking.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

By comparing a stock’s price per share to its earnings per share, we are able to see how much investors are paying for each dollar of the company’s earnings.P/E Calculation for ABBOTINDIAPrice-Earnings Ratio = Price per share ÷ Earnings per shareABBOTINDIA Price-Earnings Ratio = ₹8348 ÷ ₹204.881 = 40.7xOn its own, the P/E ratio doesn’t tell you much; however, it becomes extremely useful when you compare it with other similar companies. Our goal is to compare the stock’s P/E ratio to the average of companies that have similar attributes to ABBOTINDIA, such as company lifetime and products sold. One way of gathering a peer group is to use firms in the same industry, which is what I’ll do. At 40.7, ABBOTINDIA’s P/E is higher than its industry peers (25.5). This implies that investors are overvaluing each dollar of ABBOTINDIA’s earnings. This multiple is a median of profitable companies of 25 Pharmaceuticals companies in IN including Vasundhara Rasayans, Vivimed Labs and Vivimed Labs. You could think of it like this: the market is pricing ABBOTINDIA as if it is a stronger company than the average of its industry group.However, you should be aware that this analysis makes certain assumptions. The first is that our “similar companies” are actually similar to ABBOTINDIA. If not, the difference in P/E might be a result of other factors. For example, Abbott India Limited could be growing more quickly than the companies we’re comparing it with. In that case it would deserve a higher P/E ratio. We should also be aware that the stocks we are comparing to ABBOTINDIA may not be fairly valued. So while we can reasonably surmise that it is optimistically valued relative to a peer group, it might be fairly valued, if the peer group is undervalued.Since you may have already conducted your due diligence on ABBOTINDIA, the overvaluation of the stock may mean it is a good time to reduce your current holdings. But at the end of the day, keep in mind that relative valuation relies heavily on critical assumptions I’ve outlined above. Remember that basing your investment decision off one metric alone is certainly not sufficient. There are many things I have not taken into account in this article and the PE ratio is very one-dimensional.

Also, it shows eight-hour glucose history and how the glucose levels are changing.FreeStyle LibreLink app customers will have access to several updates and new features when compared to the FreeStyle Libre reader. The company also said that the app can replace the reader and also be used in combination with each other.  FreeStyle LibreLink customers will have the option to share information with their physicians through LibreView and LibreLinkUp. These are other digital health tools that are part of the FreeStyle Libre platform.The FreeStyle LibreLink app is free of cost for both iPhone and Android users, and will initially be available in 12 European countries.

The company has been witnessing solid growth in the global Diabetes Care business. Notably, Diabetes Care sales rose 27.6% on a comparable operational basis in the last reported fourth quarter, buoyed by double-digit international sales growth, led by continued consumer uptake of FreeStyle Libre. Accordingly, it is leaving no stone unturned to cash in on the growing popularity of this system that eliminates the need for daily finger sticks.Following the FDA approval in September 2017 for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system, Abbott recently achieved another major milestone after U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) granted FreeStyle Libre approval for Medicare coverage.Meanwhile, Abbott has been steadily progressing with the development of its Diabetes Care segment. Last September, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre in the U.K., marking another milestone for the company. Notably, the FreeStyle Libre system is partially or fully covered in 21 countries, including France, Germany and Japan.Moreover, the company announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System in June 2017. This drove the Diabetes Care segment, which saw revenue growth of 37.6% in third-quarter 2017 on continued acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.Market PotentialAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is expected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%.

ABBV together with its partner Neurocrine Biosciences announced that the FDA has approved its pipeline candidate, elagolix, for the treatment of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis, a common gynecologic disorder in women.The candidate to be marketed by the trade name of Orilissa is expected to hit the retail markets in the United States from this early August onward.The approval was granted on a priority review basis. It was supported by positive results from two replicate studies in the largest endometriosis phase III trials, which evaluated Orilissa for the given indication in women. The detailed data from the analysis showed that treatment with Orilissa resulted in statistically significant reductions in menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared with placebo.Endometriosis affects an estimated one in 10 women of reproductive age and is associated with pain symptoms. The pain associated with it is currently managed with oral contraceptives, progestins, danazol, NSAIDS, opioids and GnRH agonists. Many medicines are not specifically indicated for treating endometriosis. With Orilissa approved to treat pain associated with endometriosis, it can address a market with significant unmet need to bring in more sales for AbbVie.Notably, last September, the FDA accepted AbbVie's new drug application (NDA) for Orilissa and subsequently, granted priority review status in October. However, in April this year, the regulatory body extended its review period of marketing application for Orilissa by three months.The FDA requested for a prolonged time frame to review additional information provided by AbbVie along with its NDA related to the results of liver function tests.Shares of AbbVie have decreased 5.4% so far this year versus the industry’s decline of 1.4%.    AbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the pharma sector include Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. VNDA, Illumina, Inc. ILMN and Eli Lilly and Company LLY.

The designation also covers the esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma, which is a cancer that affects the lower part of the oesophagus.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with ABBV. Click here to check it out. ABBV 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ABBVPeter Lynch Chart of ABBVImbruvica is the trade name under which the healthcare company markets ibrutinib. Ibrutinib is a small molecule drug used to treat several B cell cancers.Under the Orphan Drug Act of January 1983, pharmaceutical companies, that otherwise would be discouraged by excessive costs and other issues, are incentivized to try to develop a cure for rare diseases.Rare diseases are those that afflict less than 200,000 people in the U.S. and incentivisation consists of fiscal benefits and a seven-year exclusive right to develop the treatment for a specific condition. The period of seven years begins once the FDA assigns the ""orphan drug"" status.Pharmacyclics, LLC is the sponsor involved into the review process before the designation of the Orphan Drug status is approved by the FDA. Pharmacyclics, LLC is a California-based U.S. biopharmaceutical company, whose core business is to develop cancer therapies. The company, which was purchased by AbbVie in 2015, is the developer of Ibrutinib.AbbVie is currently trading at $109.51 on the New York Stock Exchange. On Monday, the healthcare stock tumbled 4.9% and the current share price is nearly $16.6 above the 52-week range of $60.05 to $125.86.As Yahoo Finance's chart illustrates, for the 52-weeks through Feb. 5, AbbVie has gained 80.6% and outperformed the S&P 500 index by 65%. The stock is down trending since Jan. 26.Source: Yahoo FinanceAbbVie has a dividend yield of 2.42% versus an industry median of 1.58% and versus a S&P 500 current dividend yield of 1.85%.AbbVie has a forward dividend of $2.84 and a forward yield of 2.47%. While the industry has a median forward yield of 1.05%.Despite AbbVie is trading above the 200, 100 and the 50-SMA lines and well over the Peter Lynch's earnings line with and without nonrecurring items, the healthcare stock is still generally perceived as a buy by analysts, who predict that shares can rise a good 14% within the ensuing 12 months of trading.The RSI (14 days) has yet to reach overbought levels. However, downtrend patterns in the indicator leads us to prefigure further downsides to come. I would wait a bit before starting increasing holding AbbVie again.Company's sales are not only well supported by Humira, but the recent sales growth in the RA treatment drug should make investors sleep soundly about the future of AbbVie's flagship and main income source.(Disclosure: I have no positions neither in AbbVie nor in the S&P 500 index nor in any other stocks that belong to the same industry of AbbVie.)This article first appeared on GuruFocus.Warning!

The financial terms of the deal were kept under the wraps.Kaplan, which engages in developing and operating marketing technology platforms and touchpoints, is now part of Accenture Interactive with access to a wide range of design and innovation, marketing, content, and commerce offerings on a global scale.Benefits for AccentureAccenture Interactive considers Nordics as a strategic growth region and the acquisition appears to be the company's bid to expand digital capabilities and enrich creative talent in the region.The acquisition strengthens Accenture Interactive’s customer experience offerings and data-driven marketing capabilities in Nordics.The recent acquisition of business and certain assets of Swedish creative agency — The World Loves in October and the appointment of Adam Kerj as chief creative officer for the Nordic region in August were done to boost the company's Nordics presence.So far this year, shares of Accenture have gained 6.2%, outperforming the 1.9% rise of the Zacks S&P 500 composite. To ConcludeWe believe Accenture’s acquisitions strategy, which helps it broaden its product portfolio, market share and boost revenues, gives it an edge over competitors like Genpact G, Cognizant Technology Solutions CTSH and Infosys INFY.
