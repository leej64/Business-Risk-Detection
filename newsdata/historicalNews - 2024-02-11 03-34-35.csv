The firm’s market cap currently stands at around $926.9 Billion and its revenues and free cash flows for the previous financial year were approximately $247.4 Billion and $53.7 Billion respectively. The company’s common stock has fluctuated between a high of $190 and a low of $142 over the past 52 weeks and currently stands at around $188. Is Apple Inc. undervalued at the current price?To determine the intrinsic value of Apple Inc., we’ll begin by looking at the company’s history of free cash flow. A company’s free cash flow is the true earnings which management can either reinvest for growth or distribute back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Below is a chart of Apple Inc.’s free cash flow for the past ten years.As one can see, the company’s free cash flow has grown substantially over the last ten years at an annualized rate of around 22%. In order to determine Apple Inc.’s intrinsic value, an estimate must be made of its potential future free cash flows. To build this estimate, there is an array of potential outcomes for future free cash flows in the graph below.When examining the array of lines moving into the future, each one represents a certain probability of occurrence. The upper-bound line represents a 12% growth rate which represents the analyst consensus for Apple Inc.’s future 5-year growth. The author has used this in lieu of Apple Inc.’s 22% growth rate for the last ten years. This is because companies can seldom maintain such a high growth rate for prolonged periods. This growth rate has been assigned a 10% probability of occurrence to account for a number of factors including the rapid rate of change within the technology industry, the high level of competition, and the increasing risk of market saturation.The middle growth line represents a 7% growth rate which is based on the firm’s historical revenue growth for the previous five years. This has been used as earnings tend to revert toward this rate of growth as a company matures. This scenario has been assigned an 80% probability of occurrence in light of the potential risks outlined above.The lower bound line represents a 2% rate in free cash flow growth and assumes that the company grows in line with current average estimates for GDP growth in the United States for the next ten years. This scenario has been assigned a 10% probability as Apple Inc. and the technology industry’s trend toward innovation is likely to translate into a higher rate of growth than that of the wider economy.Assuming these potential outcomes and corresponding cash flows are accurately represented, Apple Inc. might be priced at a 7.4% annual return if the company can be purchased at today’s price. We’ll now look at another valuation metric to see if it corresponds with this estimate.Based on Apple Inc.’s current earnings yield, which is the inverse of its EV/EBIT ratio, the company is currently yielding 7.41%. This is below the firm’s 10-year historical median of 9.20% but above the Global Consumer Electronics Industry median average of 4.22%. This suggests that the company may be marginally overvalued relative to its historical average yet undervalued on a comparable basis. Finally, we’ll look at Apple Inc.’s free cash flow yield, a metric which assumes zero growth and simply measures the firm’s trailing free cash against its current market price. At the current market price, Apple Inc. has a free cash flow yield of 5.8%.Taking all these points into consideration, it seems reasonable to assume that Apple Inc. is currently trading at a marginal premium to fair value. Furthermore, the company may return around 7% at the current price if the estimated free cash flows are achieved. Now, let’s discuss how and why these estimated free cash flows could be achieved.Apple Inc. has various competitive advantages outlined below.Brand Value. One of Apple Inc.’s most powerful competitive advantage is undoubtedly its brand value. According to the Brand consultancy firm ‘Brand Finance,’ Apple currently holds to the No. 2 position on the 2018 Global 500 list with an estimated brand value of $146.3 Billion. In order for a competitor to challenge Apple Inc.’s competitive position, they would have to deploy a huge amount of capital and resources.Figure 1: Source: Brand Finance, 2018 Global 500This brand value helps to differentiate Apple Inc.’s products thus granting it pricing power with consumers. This pricing power allows the company to outperform the industry on a number of key metrics.High Switching Cost. By developing its own operating systems, marketplaces, and customer support, Apple Inc. has created what is known as a “walled garden.” This closed ecosystem has allowed the firm to create and maintain a captive user base and enables it to more successfully sell value-added services. This means that Apple Inc.’s users are much less likely to switch to an alternative as the company’s technology has become so embedded in their lives.Sophisticated Supply Chain. Apple Inc. has established a network of suppliers, developers, and business partners to create a sophisticated supply chain. The firm owns chip manufacturers, a global network of over 470 branded stores and has a community of over 6 million developers creating applications for its products. The company has also implemented data synchronization between central warehouses, its stores, and customers, and reduced the manufacturing cycle time in order to drive efficiencies. By having control over the entire process of product development, manufacturing, and marketing, Apple Inc. is able to run an extremely efficient and cost-effective supply chain which competitors find difficult to imitate. Figure 2: Apple Inc. Supply Chain. Source; Supplychain247.comNow that Apple Inc.’s competitive advantages have been considered, let’s look at some of the risk factors that could impair my assumptions of investment return.The consumer electronics industry in which Apple Inc. operates is highly competitive. The firm faces competition from a number of companies such as Alphabet, Samsung, and Microsoft. These companies possess their own competitive advantages and the necessary resources to mount a serious challenge against Apple Inc. If one of them can successfully breach its moat, this would be highly detrimental to the company’s future growth prospects. The consumer electronics and the broader technology industry is subject to rapid change and companies must continuously innovate or risk obsolescence through the process of “creative destruction.” If Apple Inc. is unable to successfully innovate new products, it may find its ability to generate future revenues and earnings impeded. Successful innovation requires an ongoing commitment to R&D spending and constant attention to market research and customer feedback. Apple Inc. has come under criticism for its implementation of a closed platform or “walled garden” to ensure a captive user group. If the firm is forced, either by regulatory or public pressure, to open up its platform, it is likely to see its moat weaken and its ability to successfully market and sell value-added products could be compromised.Whenever an investment is considered, one must compare it to any alternatives to weigh up the opportunity cost. At the time of writing, 10-year treasuries are yielding 2.96%. If we take inflation into account, the real return is likely to be closer to 1%. The S&P 500 Index is currently trading at a Shiller P/E of 32.1 which is 89.9% higher than the historical mean of 16.8. Assuming reversion to the mean occurs, the implied future annual return is likely to be -2.8%. Apple Inc., therefore, appears to offer a much better return for investors at present but other individual stocks may be found which offer a similar return relative to the risk profile.Investors must consider macroeconomic factors that may impact economic and market performance as this could influence investment returns. At the time of writing, the S&P is priced at a Shiller P/E of 32.1. This is 89.9% higher than the historical average of 16.8, suggesting markets are at elevated levels. U.S. unemployment figures are at a 30-year low suggesting that the current business cycle is nearing its peak. U.S. private debt/GDP currently stands at 199.6% and is at its highest point since 2009 when the last financial crisis prompted private sector deleveraging.The future for Apple Inc. is by no means certain given that it operates in a highly dynamic and competitive industry. The market has and continues to price the company at a lower multiple than the other tech giants such as Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook – the reason being that Apple Inc.’s moat is not as wide as these other firms and it currently has a heavy reliance on users continuously upgrading to the latest model of its products to remain relevant.Defendants of the company can rightly argue that the firm has taken steps to build a network effect through third-party developers building on its IOS, and that it has risen switching costs via the introduction of the iCloud but the company’s moat is not as wide as the other tech giants. Alphabet owns a “share of your mind” through Google which has become a synonym for “search engine.” The switching costs to replace Microsoft’s suite of products is enormous given how embedded it is in the operations of companies and individuals. As for Facebook, its network effect makes it an incredibly sticky business and its huge user database means it can generate substantial earnings from digital advertising.If Apple Inc. can repeat its past successes with bringing revolutionary products to market, it can open up new avenues for growth to drive future revenues and earnings. The key question is “can the company can continue to expand its moat or is it likely to narrow?”With regards to shareholder friendliness, Apple Inc. has been returning value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases whilst maintaining its R&D operations to ensure the development of new technologies. Between FY 2012 and Q2 2018, the company has returned $275.2 Billion in capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. In that time, the company has also grown its dividend by an annualized rate of around 37% and reduced its share count at an annualized rate of 3.83%.In summary, Apple Inc.’s future is likely to involve a slowing in growth as market saturation of the company’s products occurs, and the law of large numbers comes into play. If, however, the company is able to bring new innovative products to market, such as the hotly touted iCar, there exists the possibility that the firm could silence the naysayers and open up whole new avenues of revenue and earnings growth. On a historical basis, Apple Inc. appears to be trading at a marginal premium to fair value, yet on a comparable basis, it appears to be undervalued by the market.Based on the conservative assumptions used in the free cash flow analysis, the author concludes that Apple Inc. may return around 7% at the current market price.Disclaimer: The author does not hold ownership in any of the companies mentioned at the time of writing this article.*This article was written in collaboration with David J.

(AAPL) became the first publicly-traded U.S. company with a $1 trillion market cap, as its stock ticked up over $207.05 on Thursday, 42 years after its founding in Steve Jobs’s garage in Los Altos, Calif. But its co-founder and initial computer science genius, Steve Wozniak, reached in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, took the news in stride.“Of course I’m proud of Apple, but I don’t measure the world by human simplifications like round numbers,” Wozniak told Yahoo Finance in an email. “A company is great because it is great.”Wozniak, known as Woz, stepped away from his day-to-day role at Apple in 1985, but is technically still an employee who gets a check. (He has said it’s small.) In his varied career he created the first universal remote, helped found the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and had other entrepreneurial projects.For Wozniak, other moments in the company’s history hold far more cachet than Thursday’s crossing of the $1 trillion mark, but he says he has no favorite one.“So many, even small and unnoticed steps meant a lot to me personally. But most would probably agree that Steve Jobs’s return was the key element, even though our valuation didn’t go up until the iPod,” he said. When Apple first traded as a public company in 1980, a share cost $0.47 and the company’s market cap was $1.8 billion. In 1997, just before Jobs returned as CEO, Apple’s stock had been fluctuating, falling under $1.7 billion.Wozniak took a moment to point to Apple’s data practices in the wake of increased public scrutiny over tech giants like Facebook’s and Google’s approaches to information collection on its users.“We are a company based on great products, and we don’t have to invade your privacy to do it,” he said.–Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, retail, and personal finance.

Superficially, this looks great since we know that AAPL has generated big profits with little equity capital; however, ROE doesn’t tell us how much AAPL has borrowed in debt. Today, we’ll take a closer look at some factors like financial leverage to see how sustainable AAPL’s ROE is. See our latest analysis for AppleFirstly, Return on Equity, or ROE, is simply the percentage of last years’ earning against the book value of shareholders’ equity. For example, if the company invests $1 in the form of equity, it will generate $0.42 in earnings from this. In most cases, a higher ROE is preferred; however, there are many other factors we must consider prior to making any investment decisions.Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders EquityROE is measured against cost of equity in order to determine the efficiency of Apple’s equity capital deployed. Its cost of equity is 10.61%. Since Apple’s return covers its cost in excess of 31.41%, its use of equity capital is efficient and likely to be sustainable. Simply put, Apple pays less for its capital than what it generates in return. ROE can be split up into three useful ratios: net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. This is called the Dupont Formula:ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverageROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity)ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equityBasically, profit margin measures how much of revenue trickles down into earnings which illustrates how efficient the business is with its cost management. The other component, asset turnover, illustrates how much revenue Apple can make from its asset base. Finally, financial leverage will be our main focus today. It shows how much of assets are funded by equity and can show how sustainable the company’s capital structure is. Since financial leverage can artificially inflate ROE, we need to look at how much debt Apple currently has. At 96.03%, Apple’s debt-to-equity ratio appears balanced and indicates the above-average ROE is generated from its capacity to increase profit without a large debt burden.ROE is one of many ratios which meaningfully dissects financial statements, which illustrates the quality of a company. Apple’s ROE is impressive relative to the industry average and also covers its cost of equity. Its high ROE is not likely to be driven by high debt. Therefore, investors may have more confidence in the sustainability of this level of returns going forward. Although ROE can be a useful metric, it is only a small part of diligent research.For Apple, I’ve compiled three essential factors you should look at:Financial Health: Does it have a healthy balance sheet?

As the iPhone maker's foreign cash reserves have continued to grow to epic proportions, that cash has to go somewhere. At the end of last quarter, total cash was a whopping $285.1 billion, of which $269 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries.Also included in the total figure is nearly $157 billion in corporate bonds. Most of those bonds ($129 billion) are considered long term, maturing at least a year from now, with just $27 billion being classified as short term. However, with the company now planning on repatriating a substantial portion of its foreign reserves -- CFO Luca Maestri will share more specific details next quarter -- Apple has already ramped down its bond investing activities.Image source: Apple.Bloomberg reports that along with other tech giants that are preparing to repatriate cash, Apple has stopped participating in many bond offerings, citing anonymous sources. There are broader implications for the corporate bond market as Apple starts to ramp down its bond investing, seeing as how it's such a huge buyer of paper that it makes it a significant lender to other companies.Overall borrowing costs could start to rise. The oversubscription rate has also fallen so far this year as a result, with tech companies reportedly only buying a sixth of what they normally purchase, according to the report.Apple's corporate bond holdings (measured at fair value) have soared by nearly 60% over the past three years.Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown.These holdings aren't likely to increase much going forward, if at all.On last week's earnings call, Maestri also noted that the company plans on bringing its net cash position down to zero in the years ahead. Apple currently has net cash of $163 billion, which is a substantial sum to disburse. ""As you said, $163 billion is a large amount, and there are even practical considerations around it,"" Maestri added when answering an analyst question.When you consider the aforementioned composition of bond maturities within Apple's bond portfolio, you can appreciate the logistical challenges that Apple will be facing. Waiting for all those bonds to mature could take quite some time, as its long-term bonds typically mature in one to five years. The company could always sell those bonds in the secondary market, but Apple wouldn't want to sell off a massive amount of bonds because that activity would have notable market impact and hurt bond prices.""The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management,"" Apple wrote in its most recent 10-Q. Keep in mind that duration is not the same as maturity. Bond duration measures the sensitivity of bond prices in response to interest rate changes.Coordinating the liquidation and repatriation of that much cash will be no easy task.

But investors don't give the iGiant anywhere near the same level of respect as its largest tech peers.Apple is trading at an average 40% discount to Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)! And it's pretty much always been this way.AAPL PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsBut why is this the case?Some investors have resigned themselves to this reality. Others have very plausible excuses:Apple's simply too big for its own good.Apple isn't growing as fast as the other three.But while these make sense on the surface level, I simply don't think they explain the heart of the matter. There's only one plausible explanation: Apple's moat is nowhere near as wide as those of the other three, and the market knows it.It's true, Apple is the largest, most valuable company the world has ever known. With a bump of just 10%, it would become the history's first trillion-dollar organization. But while the law of large numbers does make sense on paper, Apple's not so big compared to its peers that it should necessitate such a discount.If you look at the top ten largest stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, all three of these peers sit in the top six.Data source: Finviz.comIt's also worth stating that just because a company is approaching a landmark like $1 trillion, it doesn't mean it can't stop growing from there. Indeed, because the stock market has always gone up over the long-run, all-time barriers are routinely broken. There's no reason Apple couldn't keep growing.Others will argue that Apple is simply not growing as fast as its tech peers. While that's true with Facebook, it isn't with Microsoft or Alphabet.MetricAppleAlphabetMicrosoftFacebook3-Year Revenue CAGR8%17%3%48%3-Year EPS CAGR13%9%11%53%Data source: E*Trade, SEC filings. CAGR = Compounded Annual Growth Rate. EPS figures calculated using non-GAAP figures when applicable.While Facebook is growing demonstrably faster, Apple's earnings growth has outpaced Alphabet (surprise!), and it has Microsoft beat on both top and bottom lines.And yet Apple still trades at a 40%+ discount.Before getting into the weeds, it's important we define our terms. A ""moat"" is another word for an enduring competitive advantage. In the simplest sense, a moat is what keeps customers (or users) coming back to a single company year after year, and holding the competition at bay for decades.Image source: Getty ImagesThere are four key types of economic moats, and while each company has elements of multiple moats in its business model, a single moat dominates. For the purposes of this article, that's convenient.Network Effect: I consider this the strongest of all moats. With each additional user, the value of a network becomes greater, further incentivizing more users to join. This is Facebook's key moat. As each user joins the network, others are incentivized to join, creating a virtuous cycle.High Switching Costs: If a customer will need to pay dearly to switch away from a service -- in terms of direct costs, time, or headaches in general -- they are more likely to stick with the incumbent. This is Microsoft's key moat. Users the world over have been using the Office Suite -- Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.-- for over two decades. This reliable income helps fund other initiatives.Low-Cost Production: If a company can offer a product or service for markedly lower costs than the competition -- with the same or greater value -- it will be the provider of choice. This is Alphabet's key moat. Remember, Google makes most of its money on advertising. Because it has seven products with over one billion users each -- search, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Chrome, Android, and Play Store -- it has tons of data that it gets just for maintaining these properties. Advertisers pay hand over fist for that data.Intangible Assets: This includes things like brand value, patents, and regulatory protection. This is Apple's key moat. Its brand is the most valuable in the world, and patents on in-house developed chips are a key differentiator.No moat will ever mean that a business is safe forever. As Arjun Sethi -- co-founder and CEO of MessageMe -- recently wrote: ""A moat simply buys a company time to figure out the next great business."" [emphasis in original].Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook have business models with uber-wide moats around them. It would take a herculean effort to create a social network with as much stickiness as Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp (and not get bought out by Facebook). Someone would need to wrest ""Google it"" from our lexicon to break the stranglehold that Alphabet has on our search data. And competitors have been trying for decades to create a better Excel spreadsheet.Those advantages give the leaders of these businesses an enormous head-start on figuring out the Next Big Thing.There's no questioning Apple's status in the industry. But it has to count on its users continually upgrading to the next iPhone to remain relevant. That's not exactly an enduring advantage when viewed against the protection that Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft enjoy.Don't get me wrong -- I'm an Apple shareholder myself. The company has done a great job of introducing high switching-costs via the iCloud, and it benefits from the network effect of third-party app developers building on its iOS. Its efforts in providing services have also been hugely successful.But for now, it is predominantly an iPhone maker. And it is priced accordingly. I think the price is fair -- which is why I'm holding my shares. But I have no illusions of it ever consistently trading above a P/E of 20. You shouldn't either.

Using the most recent financial data, I am going to take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced using the discounted cash flows (DCF) model. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. If you are reading this after May 2018 then I highly recommend you check out the latest calculation for Apple here.We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which simply means we have two different periods of varying growth rates for the company’s cash flows. Generally the initial phase has higher growth rates that plateau over time. To start off, I pulled together the analyst consensus forecast of AAPL’s levered free cash flow (FCF) over the next five years and discounted these figures at the cost of equity of 10.46%. This resulted in a present value of 5-year cash flow of US$234.18B. Keen to understand how I arrived at this number? Read our detailed analysis here.The infographic above illustrates how AAPL’s earnings are expected to move going forward, which should give you some color on AAPL’s outlook. Then, I calculate the terminal value, which is the business’s cash flow after the first stage. It’s appropriate to use the 10-year government bond rate of 2.8% as the steady growth rate, which is rightly below GDP growth, but more towards the conservative side. After discounting the terminal value back five years, the present value becomes US$486.10B.The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next five years and the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$720.27B. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. This results in an intrinsic value of $141.95, which, compared to the current share price of $165.26, we see that Apple is fair value, maybe slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn’t be the only metric you look at when researching a company.For AAPL, I’ve compiled three relevant aspects you should look at:Financial Health: Does AAPL have a healthy balance sheet?

In addition to the $38 billion in taxes it must pay, Apple has run up $97 billion in U.S.-issued debt to pay for previous share buybacks and dividends.Some investors said the Apple U.S. investments would give the company room to make more stock buybacks or pay dividends without criticism, and Apple shares rose 1.7 percent for the day.Walter Piecyk, managing director for TMT Research at BTIG Research, said he could not yet tell whether the U.S. expansion was an increase from a previous plan or meant investment abroad was being refocused in the United States. Reuters Breakingviews estimated that Apple could have increased U.S. headcount by 24,000 in the last five years.Trump described the move by Apple as victory for his policies.""I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States. Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.APPLE SERVICES PUSHAbout a third of Apple's new spending will be on data centers to house its iCloud, App Store and Apple Music services, a sign of the rising importance of subscription services to a company known for its computers and gadgets. The company has data centers in seven states.The announced U.S spending would be a significant part of Apple's overall capital expenditures. Globally, the company spent $14.9 billion in 2017 and expects to spend $16 billion in 2018, figures that include both U.S.-based investments in data centers and other projects and Asian investments in tooling for its contract manufacturers.If Apple's overall capital expenditures continue to expand at the same rate expected this year, the $30 billion investment in the United States could represent about a third of its capital expenditures over the next five years.The announced tax payment was roughly in line with expectations, said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross. The tax bill requires companies to pay a one-time tax on foreign-held earnings whether they intend to bring them back to the United States or not.Apple had set aside $36.3 billion in anticipation of tax payments on its foreign cash, meaning the payment would not represent a major impact on its cash flow this quarter.James Cordwell of Atlantic Equities said Apple's U.S. investment plan could make it easier for the company to give more cash to shareholders.""Being seen to just hand the cash back to shareholders could spark some political sensitivities,"" and the spending announcement could be part of Apple's efforts to manage this issue, Cordwell said.Apple also said it would boost its advanced manufacturing fund, used to provide capital and support to suppliers such as Finisar Corp (FNSR.O) and Corning Inc (GLW.N), from $1 billion to $5 billion. Apple said it planned to spend $55 billion with U.S.-based suppliers in 2018, up from $50 billion last year.AMAZON VS APPLEApple joins Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in scouting for a location for a new campus. Amazon finished taking applications from cities in October for its second headquarters.Amazon set off a scramble between cities across the nation to host the headquarters, and Apple's announcement stirred broad interest. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters on Wednesday that ""we're going to go compete and we're going to put our best foot forward"" to compete for an Apple campus. A Philadelphia Department of Commerce spokeswoman said the city would submit a proposal if Apple opened the process for bids.Apple has not said whether it had settled on a new campus location yet, and it did not make any commitments on the size of new spending or hiring specific to the campus. It did say it would initially house technical support for customers and would announce the location later this year.The facility would be in addition to its ""spaceship"" Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, California; a campus in Austin, Texas that houses customer service agents and some manufacturing; and an Elk Grove, California, unit with several thousand customer service agents and iPhones refurbishing technicians.Apple also has built its own data centers in North Carolina, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona and a recently announced project in Iowa, and leases data center space in other states.(Additional reporting by Sonam Rai, Pushkala Aripaka, Muvija M. and Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham, Peter Henderson, Marguerita Choy and Richard Chang)Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsThese stocks can help investors profit from rapid growth in the AI chip market.Dividends are just a bonus with many of these stocks.If you’re hoping to gauge Americans’ lingering discontent with postpandemic price increases, look no further than the McDonald’s menu.In the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
