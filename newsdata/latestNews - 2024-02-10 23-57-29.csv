Oil, gold futures fall, dollar rises as hopes for March rate cut fade`https://finance.yahoo.com/video/oil-gold-futures-fall-dollar-163521040.html`2024-02-05 16:35:21`Thank you for your patience.Our engineers are working quickly to resolve the issue.`['DX-Y.NYB', 'BZ=F', 'DX=F', 'CL=F', 'GC=F']`
Gold Shines as the US Economy Slows`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-shines-us-economy-slows-102254701.html`2024-02-02 10:22:54`With the Federal Reserve (‘the Fed’) having signalled that a cut to the funds rate is unlikely next month, the slight majority of traders now expects a hold on 20 March according to CME FedWatch Tool.Instability in the Middle East and specifically the USA’s response to attacks on its troops in Jordan has moved out of traders’ view temporarily but remains likely to have some effect on sentiment into next week. The critical release affecting gold today, 2 February, is the job report for January. The figure for total nonfarm is expected to decline around 40,000 to 180,000 while unemployment might edge up to 3.8%. Whatever the result, volatility for gold is likely to increase further around the release at 13.30 GMT.The overall uptrend still seems to be active, with momentum on 1 February having increased and the price pushing clearly above resistance around $2,050. Whether it holds there in the near future depends mainly on the result of the NFP and traders’ reactions to it. However, on the whole the technical picture has become more positive in recent days.Buyers appeared to overcome selling pressure as shown by the large upward real body on Thursday coming after two fairly long wicks. Meanwhile the price remains above all of the 20, 50, 100 and 200 SMAs. The movement on 1 February could be interpreted as an upward breakout from a symmetrical triangle, signalling further gains, but a strong result from the NFP could easily drive the price back down.The pound sterling has been flat overall against the dollar since December 2023 with relatively low volatility. As widely expected, the Bank of England (‘the BoE’) held its rate on 1 February and hinted that it sees further hikes as unnecessary unless inflation starts rising significantly again. For now, it’s probably still too early to make a very educated guess on how long or even whether the BoE’s rate will be higher than the Fed’s this summer.Overall, the American economy certainly seems to be performing better than the UK’s in terms of GDP and employment. Apart from the NFP, traders are looking ahead eagerly this month to American inflation and British preliminary GDP for last quarter on 15 February. If the latter’s negative, the UK is likely in recession.As for gold above, the NFP is the critical release for cable this week. Here, though, the potential for a decisive movement seems to be less. The current $1.27 is the same area as late November’s high and generally one wouldn’t expect a major forex pair to sustain a directional trend for a long time. The base case around the job report seems to be movement towards the top of the channel around $1.282 or the bottom near $1.262 depending on the result.The opinions in this article are personal to the author.

Mali gold production stable at 66.5 metric tons in 2023`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mali-gold-production-stable-66-172435031.html`2024-01-26 17:24:35`BAMAKO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Mali's industrial gold production stood at 66.5 metric tons last year, almost unchanged from 66.2 tons in 2022, the West African country's mines ministry said on Friday.Mali is one of Africa's top gold producers and home to industrial mines operated by international companies including Barrick Gold, B2Gold Corp, Resolute Mining and Hummingbird Resources.According to the ministry's data, Barrick Gold remains the country's biggest gold producer, with an output of 23.5 tons in 2023, followed by B2Gold at 20.6 tons and Resolute Mining at 7.3 tons.With an estimated 6 tons produced in artisanal mines, Mali's total gold production in 2023 is expected to reach 72.5 tons, the mines ministry said.Industrial gold output remained stable year-on-year, failing to reach the forecast of 67.7 tons announced by a mines ministry official.Last November, Mali signed an agreement with Russia to build a 200-ton-per-year gold refinery in the capital Bamako.It also adopted a new mining code that will allow the military-led government to increase its ownership in mining projects to 35% from 20%.More than 70 artisanal gold miners were killed in Mali's southwestern Koulikoro Region last week after the shaft they were working in collapsed.Artisanal mining is a common activity across much of West Africa and has risen in recent years due to growing demand for metals and rising prices. Deadly accidents are frequent, however, as these miners often use unregulated digging methods.

These Are the 4 Best Silver Coin Types To Buy in Order To Turn a Profit`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-best-silver-coin-types-123010528.html`2024-01-26 12:30:10`Silver coins are highly prized by dealers and collectors — not just because of their silver content, but also because they tend to be scarcer than coins minted with copper, nickel, zinc and other metals. The most valuable silver coins sell for millions of dollars, but even ones worth much less than that can turn a tidy profit.See: Lincoln Pennies With Dime Reverse Sides Are So Rare They’ll Fetch Upwards of $100KFind: Pocket an Extra $400 a Month With This Simple HackFinding rare and valuable silver coins outside of dealers and auctions can be a challenge because there aren’t a ton in circulation anymore. The Coinage Act of 1965, signed by President Lyndon Johnson, eliminated 90% silver coins from circulation, according to a blog from ModernCointMart. That law mainly affected U.S. dimes and quarters. Half-dollar coins were still made with 40% silver from 1965 to 1970, but after 1970 no more circulating U.S. coins were made with silver.You can find still find valuable silver coins on the collectibles market, however, and they might be a good investment. If nothing else, adding silver coins can help diversify your portfolio and give you a hedge against inflation and economic volatility. When spot price eventually rises, provided you have a low dollar cost average regarding your silver stack, you can sell for a profit.If you are interested in buying silver coins, here are four basic types as listed by the United States Gold Bureau (USGB).Also: Rare Bicentennial Quarter Has Nearly $20K Value — Plus 7 More Worth Big MoneySponsored: Owe the IRS $10K or more? Schedule a FREE consultation to see if you qualify for tax relief.These are 90% silver coins minted before 1965, as referenced above. “Junk silver,” as a category, represents coinage from their period which holds “no collectible or numismatic value” — and is therefore “worthless” to collectors, according to the USGB. It should be noted that not all 90% silver from that period can be classified as “junk silver,” merely common and/or more damaged or circulated examples. However, you might be able to make a profit from them based on their silver content. As the USGB noted, you can buy these coins cheaply and in bulk to build a large collection with relatively pure silver content.The American Silver Eagle began production in 1986 when the U.S. Defense National Stockpile wanted to get rid of its surplus silver, according to the USGB. One advantage of the American Silver Eagle (ASE) is that it can be used as a silver investment. They’re even eligible as an IRA asset.There are three variations of this 0.999 fine silver coin: bullion ASEs, which are the cheapest and mainly used for silver investing; burnished ASEs, which are the rarest; and proof ASEs, which are the most expensive.The USGB calls the silver Britannia “one of the most recognized rare silver coins on the planet.” The UK Royal Mint created these coins in 1997 following the success of their gold Britannia coins. The 1998 to 2012 editions contained 0.958 pure silver, while those from 2013 on contained 0.999 pure silver. Most of the coins bear images of Queen Elizabeth II, though from 2023 onward the coins bear the visage of King Charles III.This is another silver sovereign coin valued by collectors. It contains 0.9999 fine pure silver and is minted yearly by the Royal Canadian Mint. Like the silver Britannia, many of the Silver Maple Leafs (SMLs) feature Queen Elizabeth II. They have since been updated following the death of the queen in 2022, and newer versions — similarly to the Britannias — feature King Charles III.More From GOBankingRatesI'm a Bank Teller: Here Are 10 Mistakes You Are Making With Your Banking5 Used Cars You Shouldn't BuyUse This Checklist To See Whether Your Bank is Costing You a Lot of Money7 Creative Sources of Passive Income to Consider in 2024This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: These Are the 4 Best Silver Coin Types To Buy in Order To Turn a ProfitRelated Quotes`['GC=F', 'ZG=F', 'HG=F', 'SI=F', 'ZI=F']`

11 Best Aluminum and Aluminum Mining Stocks To Buy`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-aluminum-aluminum-mining-185911107.html`2024-02-02 18:59:11`In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best aluminum and aluminum mining stocks to buy. If you want to skip our introduction of the aluminum market and the coverage of some recent developments, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Aluminum and Aluminum Mining Stocks To Buy. Aluminum is one of the most important raw materials on Earth. The modern day transportation industry is built on the back of the shiny metal as its light weight and high strength make it suitable for applications that require cost efficiency such as aircraft. Making a steel aircraft is likely to scare engineers when they look at engine fuel consumption and other constraints such as take off weight.Since its demand depends on industrial output, aluminum market prices depend on investor perceptions of global economic activity. If they believe that conditions are ripe for growth, then prices will appreciate as aluminum firms scurry to add capacity. On the supply side, the aluminum industry depends on a handful of countries to continue stable production. If for any reason production is halted, then prices jump as well.As part of our coverage of 15 Largest Aluminum Producing Countries In The World, Insider Monkey discovered that as of December 2022, the People's Republic of China was the world's largest aluminum producer. China produced 40 million tons of aluminum in 2022, and the second biggest aluminum producer was the Republic of India whose four million tons placed it at a distant second.Looking at global aluminum demand, our look at the top fifteen largest consumers of aluminum shows that while China was the largest producer, it was South Korea that led the pack as it consumed nearly 43 kilograms of aluminum per person in 2022. Interestingly though, if you check out Aluminum Consumption By Country: Top 15 then you'll find that while China produced the most aluminum, it was Canada that was the world's largest aluminum supplier as Canadian aluminum exports touched $8.31 billion in 2021.Shifting gears, the aluminum industry is made of large and small companies that have to invest substantial capital in mining facilities. Some of the biggest aluminum companies in the world are spread all over China, Japan, and Australia. These include Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), the Saudi Arabian Mining Company, and Vedanta Aluminum. This shows that despite the fact that Canada was the world's largest aluminum exporter in 2021, the aluminum companies themselves are not limited to one continent.In terms of dollar value, the global aluminum industry was worth $255 billion as 2022 ended. Analysts believe that from there onward until 2029, the sector will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1% until 2029 for an estimated worth of $255 billion.Additionally, since it's literally the building block of modern day construction and transportation, aluminum is also one of the oldest post industrial revolution industries. One of the oldest companies in the world is Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) which was set up in 1886. Alcoa sells bauxite and aluminum, and January 2024 has seen the firm post its fourth quarter of 2023 earnings results. The results saw Alcoa meet analyst revenue estimates and beat them for earnings per share by posting $2.6 billion and -$0.56 (analyst estimates had penciled in an 84 cent loss). Consequently, the shares proceeded to appreciate by double digit percentages in the stock market in the days following the earnings release. Alcoa's earnings saw the firm's management share that raw material costs were favorable during the fourth quarter but higher energy costs continued to be a headwind.According to Alcoa's chief financial officer Molly Beerman:Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA increased as improved raw material costs and shipment volumes offset energy and price-mix challenges. In addition, favorable production costs, including recognition of the full-year benefit for Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act at Warrick and Massena more than offset higher other expenses. Alumina segment EBITDA increased $31 million sequentially, primarily on lower raw material costs and lower production costs in Brazil and Australia. We also saw a substantial benefit from lower raw material costs in the Aluminum segment, which combined with favorable production costs, primarily 45X, to offset the impact of higher energy costs and lower value-add product premiums.The higher enerminugy costs included a second year of unfavorable legislative changes in Norway’s CO2 compensation arrangement. Outside the segments, transformation demolition costs were lower, but inter-segment eliminations and other corporate costs were unfavorable. Let’s look at cash movements within the fourth quarter on the next slide. The cash balance increased $18 million in the quarter to $944 million. The largest source of cash was working capital reduction of $222 million, which more than offset the largest use of cash, capital expenditures at $188 million, higher EBITDA of $89 million, various other items totaling $97 million and net non-controlling interest contributions of $18 million, mostly offset all other uses of cash. Moving on to other key financial metrics.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best aluminum and aluminum mining stocks to buy. Some top picks are Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM), Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA), and Crown Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CCK).An airplane hangar filled with components, showing the enormous scale of the company's maintenance & overhaul services.Our Methodology To make our list of the best aluminum and aluminum mining stocks, we ranked companies that mine the material or produce end products such as ingots by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares during Q3 2023.

Alcoa to supply Nexans with low-carbon aluminum, including metal from ELYSIS™ technology`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alcoa-supply-nexans-low-carbon-133000168.html`2024-02-01 13:30:00`"Alcoa will supply Nexans with low-carbon aluminum rod that will contain metal from the breakthrough ELYSIS™ technologyELYSIS™ is a technology partnership that is ramping up a process that eliminates all direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional smelting process, emitting oxygen as a byproductAluminum rod produced from ELYSIS™ technology will have lower CO2 emissionsPITTSBURGH, February 01, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alcoa (NYSE:AA) announced today that it will supply global cable producer Nexans with aluminum produced from a revolutionary process that eliminates all direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional smelting process.Nexans will be the world’s first cable manufacturer to use metal from the breakthrough ELYSIS™ process, which replaces all greenhouse gas emissions with oxygen. The technology uses proprietary materials, including inert anodes, first developed at the Alcoa Technical Center near Pittsburgh. That research and development work became the technological basis for ELYSIS™, a technology partnership that is working to ramp up the process to commercial scale.Several Nexans facilities in Western Europe and Scandinavia will use aluminum produced from the ELYSIS™ process to start qualifications for the metal’s use in various types of cables, from low, medium to high voltage. Aluminum rod produced with this breakthrough ELYSIS™ technology could eliminate a significant portion of carbon dioxide emissions in the future.This latest announcement further builds on the two companies’ historic long-term relationship. Alcoa already supplies Nexans with EcoLum™, a primary aluminum with a carbon footprint that is nearly three times lower than the industry average.1Since the launch of ELYSIS™ in 2018, the technology company has produced R&D quantities of the metal. Alcoa is marketing and selling its share of the ELYSIS metal, which has also been used for the wheels on the Audi eTron GT, the automaker’s first electric sports car. Apple is also an investor in the technology and has used ELYSIS metal for some of its products.ELYSIS is a key component in Alcoa’s technology roadmap of research and development projects that also includes projects such as the ASTRAEA™ metal purification process and the Refinery of the Future.This agreement fully highlights Nexans’ position at the forefront of the sustainable electrification of the world and regarding crucial issues such as low-carbon emissions.Renato Bacchi – Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Alcoa:""Alcoa is well positioned to supply low carbon aluminum for the world’s transition to renewable energy, as we know that the true impact of decarbonization will also include the choice of materials used to build the infrastructure for generation, transmission and distribution networks. While we are developing ELYSIS™ for the future, we are also supplying low-carbon aluminum today with our EcoLum™ metal, which can help customers meet their own sustainability goals and lower their carbon footprints.""Vincent Dessale – Nexans Chief Operating Officer Senior Executive VP:""In the fight against climate change, solutions that support the world’s energy transition make a real difference. By increasing our use of low-carbon aluminum, we want to lead the way toward a sustainable electrification of the world: the rod produced with this breakthrough technology could eliminate a significant portion of carbon dioxide emissions in the future. We are proud to be the world’s first cable manufacturer to use metal from the breakthrough technology ELYSIS™.""1: Alcoa’s EcoLum™ primary aluminum is produced with less than 4.0 metric tons of CO2e for every ton of metal, including both direct and indirect (Scope 1 and Scope 2) emissions from mining, refining, smelting and casting. EcoLum's emissions intensity vs. the global average per ton of per ton of CO2e/ton of aluminum is approximately three times better than the global average of 13.3, based on CRU emissions intensity data, 2022About Alcoa CorporationAlcoa (NYSE: AA) is a global industry leader in bauxite, alumina and aluminum products with a vision to reinvent the aluminum industry for a sustainable future.

All participant will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask question. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today’s event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to James Dwyer, Vice President, Investor Relations and Pension Investments. Please go ahead.James Dwyer: Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by William Oplinger, Alcoa Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer; and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly. As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation.We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted on this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website. With that, here's Bill.William Oplinger: Thanks, Jim, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Today, we'll review the substantial progress we've made in the fourth quarter on key objectives, the financial results, the market and our plans to continue to improve and strengthen our company. I started last quarter's call by affirming the areas of Alcoa's near-term focus and reinforcing our values to act with integrity, operate with excellence, care for people and lead with courage. Consistent with those values, I'm proud that Alcoa's safety performance showed marked improvement in 2023. While we experienced two FSI-As last year, we improved year-over-year in all key safety metrics. We intend to continue our progress toward our goal of an injury-free workplace.Safety performance is important for another reason too. It's a key indicator of the stability and quality of our operations. Excellent safety performance goes hand-in-hand with operational excellence. I'm not surprised then, given our strong safety performance, we set production records at our three smelters in Canada and one in Norway, and we are also successfully restarting one potline at Warrick here in the States. We made great progress on other focus areas too. We achieved, what I said was our most important objective, gaining approvals for our bauxite mines in Western Australia. With these approvals, we now have a clear path forward for continued operation in Western Australia. Also in WA, we recently announced the curtailment of the 60-year-old Kwinana refinery, starting in the second quarter of this year.The decision was based on a variety of factors, including Kwinana's age, scale, operating costs and current bauxite grades, in addition to current market conditions. In December, we began engagement with the national and regional authorities in Spain, as well as the labor works council to discuss ongoing financial losses at the San Ciprian refinery and smelter. We are considering all forms of relief, while working collaboratively on a long-term solution for the complex. With that, let me turn it over to Molly to go over the financials.Molly Beerman: Thank you, Bill. Revenue was flat sequentially at $2.6 billion as lower shipments for both Alumina and Aluminum more than offset higher aluminum realized price. The net loss attributable to Alcoa improved $18 million to $150 million, and the loss per share improved from $0.94 to $0.84. On an adjusted basis, the net loss attributable to Alcoa was $100 million or $0.56. The difference is primarily related to the recording of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Brazil, net of non-controlling interest. Adjusted EBITDA increased $19 million to $89 million. For the full-year 2023, year-over-year revenues decreased $1.9 billion to $10.6 billion and net loss attributable to Alcoa worsened $528 million to a loss of $651 million, or $3.65 per share.Adjusted net income changed from $869 million in 2022 to a loss of $405 million in 2023, or $2.27 per share. And adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, moved from $2.2 billion to $536 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA increased as improved raw material costs and shipment volumes offset energy and price-mix challenges. In addition, favorable production costs, including recognition of the full-year benefit for Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act at Warrick and Massena more than offset higher other expenses. Alumina segment EBITDA increased $31 million sequentially, primarily on lower raw material costs and lower production costs in Brazil and Australia. We also saw a substantial benefit from lower raw material costs in the Aluminum segment, which combined with favorable production costs, primarily 45X, to offset the impact of higher energy costs and lower value-add product premiums.The higher energy costs included a second year of unfavorable legislative changes in Norway's CO2 compensation arrangement. Outside the segments, transformation demolition costs were lower, but inter-segment eliminations and other corporate costs were unfavorable. Let's look at cash movements within the fourth quarter on the next slide. The cash balance increased $18 million in the quarter to $944 million. The largest source of cash was working capital reduction of $222 million, which more than offset the largest use of cash, capital expenditures at $188 million, higher EBITDA of $89 million, various other items totaling $97 million and net non-controlling interest contributions of $18 million, mostly offset all other uses of cash. Moving on to other key financial metrics.Our key financial metrics are consistent with our earnings results. Full-year 2023 return-on-equity was negative 8.9%. Our fourth quarter dividend added $18 million to stockholder capital returns, which totaled $72 million for the year. While free cash flow plus net non-controlling interest contributions was negative for the year at $282 million, it was positive $28 million in the fourth quarter. Proportional adjusted net debt increased by $0.1 billion due to fourth quarter pension and OPEB plan re-measurements. In both the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, capital expenditures and cash income taxes were our largest uses of cash. Days working capital improved 11 days to 39 days year-over-year, primarily on decreases in inventories of $243 million.Sequential improvement, also 11 days, was driven primarily by the typical increase in year-end payables, while reducing inventory values further. The improved working capital performance provided a significant source of cash in the fourth quarter, resulting in a full-year working capital source of cash of $221 million. Let's turn to the outlook in the first quarter and the full-year 2024. For 2024, we have included an outlook for both production and shipments for the segments. We expect Alumina production to range between 9.8 million and 10.0 million tons and shipments to range between 12.7 million and 12.9 million tons. The difference reflects our normal trading volumes, as well as externally sourced alumina to cover the customer contracts previously fulfilled by Kwinana production.The Aluminum segment is expected to produce between 2.2 million and 2.3 million tons, increasing on smelter restarts, while shipments hold steady between 2.5 million and 2.6 million tons due to lower projected trading volumes. In EBITDA items outside the segments, we expect transformation cost to remain at $80 million and other corporate expense to improve to $120 million, reflecting a portion of our efforts in productivity and competitiveness programs. Below EBITDA, we expect depreciation to increase to $675 million, primarily due to additional assets placed in service as well as increases in the assets related to asset retirement obligations from mine reclamation and bauxite residue storage. Non-operating pension and OPEB expense is expected to be flat at $15 million and interest expense will be comparable to 2023's level at $110 million.For cash flow impacts, we expect 2024 pension and OPEB required cash funding to be similar to 2023 at $70 million. The majority of that spend is U.S. OPEB. Our capital returns to stockholders will continue to be aligned with our capital allocation framework. Our current capital expenditure estimate is $550 million, with $90 million in return-seeking and $460 million in sustaining capital. Approximately 65% of the total CapEx is within the Alumina segment, where 40% is funded by our JV partner. Looking ahead to 2025 and 2026, we expect CapEx to increase approximately $50 million to about $600 million, primarily related to mine moves. We expect approximately $130 million lower prior period income tax payments in 2024, down to $50 million. Environmental and ARO spending is expected to increase to approximately $295 million, approximately $20 million related to accelerated mine rehabilitation in both Australia and Brazil.We also expect higher spending at Kwinana and residue area closures and regulatory requirements in Brazil, and more spend is projected for demolition and remediation at previously closed sites in 2024 as we prepare those properties for future redevelopment. While we do not provide guidance on full-year cash restructuring charges, we did provide the estimates for the Kwinana curtailment in our January 8th announcement. Of Alcoa's share of related cash outlays, approximately $80 million are expected to be spent in 2024 and approximately $35 million in 2025. Our JV partner, Alumina Limited will cover the remaining 40% of those costs or approximately $65 million. To provide flexibility to implement our portfolio actions, today we executed an amendment to our revolving credit facility agreement, which includes adjusting covenant limits for the 2024 fiscal year.Looking at the first quarter. In the Alumina segment, we expect approximately $15 million unfavorable impacts related to higher maintenance costs and lower volume in Australia. In addition, we expect benefits from lower raw materials and energy costs to be fully offset by other factors. In Aluminum, we expect multiple factors to fully offset, including favorable energy impacts, primarily due to lower prices in Brazil and Norway, lower product premiums and unfavorable net impact from the non-recurrence of fourth quarter 2023 one-time items. Alumina costs and the Aluminum segment are expected to be unfavorable by $5 million. Additionally, we expect a one-time unfavorable impact of approximately $20 million, as the hedge programs for the Alumar smelter restart ended in December 2023.Below EBITDA, note that fourth quarter other expenses included one-time positive impacts of $51 million, primarily foreign currency gains. Based on recent pricing, we expect first quarter 2024 operational tax expense to be negligible. Now, I will turn it back to Bill.William Oplinger: Thanks, Molly. Now let's discuss our markets. In Alumina, prices rallied at the end of the fourth quarter, driven by announced Chinese refinery curtailments due to a domestic bauxite shortage and concerns about Guinea bauxite supply, and have continued to increase in January. We expect the market to be short in 2024 with steady demand from smelters and little inventory available. In Aluminum, for 2024, we expect the balance to slight surplus market, depending on the speed of demand recovery during the year. On the supply side, there are few announced restarts or new projects and China has held to its 45 million ton capacity cap. In addition, hydro power shortages caused 1.2 million tons of capacity to be curtailed in Yunnan province last November.Demand has stabilized in North America and Europe, and we see the potential for a moderate recovery throughout the year. Regional premiums are increasing due to both the widening contango and higher transportation costs to import metal. In our order book, value add product orders are stabilizing and premiums appear to be firming up. While lower than their peaks, that premiums remain above historical levels. In China, we expect government stimulus programs to prompt demand growth as those measures take effect. Globally, growth in aluminum-intensive EVs and renewable power infrastructure will continue to support this positive trend. We also see demand improving in packaging as inventory destocking has been largely accomplished. And finally, on a concerning note, we have seen the share of Russian metal stocks on the LME stocks 90% in December.Because LME stocks are now predominantly Russian origin metal, which is unwanted by much of the world, subject to a 200% tariff in the U.S. and now legally prohibited in the U.K., it is difficult to have confidence that the LME exchange price matches the true physical price for non-Russian aluminum. In December, we joined others within European Aluminium to call on the EU to progress sanctions against Russia, and specifically, to include aluminum primary metal, which remains outside of the scope of the measures currently agreed to by the EU. Now, let's turn our focus from the market to Alcoa and our actions to improve profitability. This slide describes factors that can improve our financial performance over 2023's results. As you can see from the chart, we have significant upside potential to adjusted EBITDA.We divide the improvement drivers into three categories: near-term actions; medium-term opportunities; and market improvement. Near-term actions are underway and have the most well-defined financial impacts. The largest area of impact is our $310 million estimate of raw material savings for 2024, including for key raw materials like caustic soda and lime for refining and anode carbon products for smelting. Thanks to our procurement team's actions as well as pricing and inventory lags, roughly one-third of that amount is already fully realizable, and the remainder is conservatively estimated using current market pricing. Next, we are targeting $100 million benefit from our program to reduce controllable operating costs across our organization.Outside of raw materials, energy and transportation, which are already under active management. Recently initiated full run-rate savings are expected to be achieved by the first quarter of 2025. This overarching program includes general belt tightening, as well as efforts such as our workforce blueprint, in which we benchmark our operations internally and externally and set an aggressive best-in-class goals for each operation. Three additional components of our near-term actions are: the Warrick smelter optimization and potline restart, with the benefit of additional IRA funding at both Warrick and Massena; completing the Alumar smelter restart and realizing savings from the Kwinana curtailment. All of these locations are fully mobilized and working toward achieving the savings targets.As mentioned earlier, last month, we started discussions with union and government stakeholders on finding a long-term solution for the San Ciprian smelter and refinery. In late 2021, with the support of our employees, local communities and government, we started down a path that aimed at positioning the San Ciprian complex for long-term economic viability. To accomplish that goal, Alcoa invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the operations and supporting employees, their families and the local economy. While operations continue to be restricted to 50% at the refinery and are fully curtailed at the smelter, 2023 EBITDA losses were over $150 million across the San Ciprian complex. Despite our collective efforts, we've clearly fallen far short of our goal of achieving economic viability for San Ciprian.Looking-forward into 2024, the San Ciprian complex is expected to incur substantial losses, even with the recent improvements in energy markets and the aluminum price. If the situation does not change significantly in the months ahead, we anticipate that available funding will be exhausted in the second-half of 2024. If that happens, we will have no choice but to make hard decisions that will adversely and potentially irrevocably impact employment and the economy in Galicia more broadly. Nobody wants that. But absent significant change, that is exactly what will happen. That is why we are urgently advancing our engagement efforts with employees and governments to begin defining options. For its part, Alcoa intends to continue to honor the spirit of the commitments it made in the viability agreement.However, we will need flexibility from our unions and significant support from the regional and national governments. Medium-term opportunities and market improvements are the other two drivers of adjusted EBITDA improvement potential. Medium-term opportunities are beyond 2024 and 2025, but achievable in the next several years. An example is benefiting from better bauxite grades in Australia after upcoming mine moves. When it comes to market impacts, we are a commodity business. A large part of adjusted EBITDA potential correlates to market improvement. As an example, comparing more favorable 2022 metal and alumina prices to 2023 prices reveals massive potential for EBITDA improvement, especially in the metals segment should prices increase.We have demonstrated the ability to profit from favorable market conditions when they arise. Finally, we have not included here the potential we see from breakthrough R&D technologies, including ELYSIS, because they are longer-term. We do not anticipate significant capital expenditures for ELYSIS before the end of the decade, although the continued ramp-up of the R&D work will produce additional volume of ELYSIS metal for the partners, including Alcoa, to bring to-market. For the quarter, I'm very proud that we have remained true to our values, including improving on both safety and operational performance. While profit metrics improved slightly on a sequential basis, we are aiming to improve substantially from where we are today. And on that front, we have made important and impactful progress on our key challenges.Going forward, we are working to maintain positive momentum in Western Australia and continue to build toward a long-term solution for our San Ciprian complex in Spain. Our entire organization is focused on delivering near-term actions and company-wide productivity and competitiveness programs. We believe that not only is the medium and long-term outlook for aluminum strong, but 2024 starting to look like a positive turning point.

3 Stocks Poised to Bounce Back After a Brutal 2023`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-poised-bounce-back-033000859.html`2024-01-19 03:30:00`While 2023 was a good year overall for the stock market, not every company shared in the gains. The S&P 500 index rose 24% last year, but most of that growth came from a handful of mega-cap technology stocks known as the Magnificent 7, many of which are closely associated with the red-hot field of artificial intelligence (AI).Numerous stocks continued to decline in 2023 and their shareholders only saw red during the year. Reasons for the decline include poor financial results, difficult economic conditions, and geopolitical events outside of management’s control. That said, things are looking better for many of last year’s laggards. As we begin a New Year, expectations for a turnaround are rising. Here are three stocks poised to bounce back after a brutal 2023.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) looks to be back on track after a difficult time in 2023. TSMC, as the company is commonly known, struggled last year with a drop in demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and laptops. The decreased demand left smartphone and computer makers with excess inventories of the microchips and semiconductors that TSMC makes. As a result, sales suffered and TSM stock fell 27%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut now, TSM stock is rebounding and up 7% after the company issued strong fourth-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street expectations right across the board. The world’s largest manufacturer of microchips and semiconductors reported Q4 revenue of $625.53 billion New Taiwan dollars ($19.62 billion U.S.), which topped consensus forecasts of NT$618.31 billion. Profits also beat Wall Street forecasts. Most importantly, TSMC’s CEO C.C. Wei gave an upbeat forecast for the year ahead, saying the company is well-positioned to capture current and future growth opportunities.Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.comFew stocks had it as bad in 2023 as aluminum producer Alcoa (NYSE:AA). Shareholders of the Pittsburgh-based company watched in horror as AA stock plunged 46% over the past year and hit its lowest level since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Alcoa’s earnings and stock have been impacted by weak commodity prices, with benchmark aluminum prices declining 15% throughout 2023. However, those troubles might now be in the company’s rearview mirror.Alcoa just reported better-than-expected Q4 earnings. The company announced an earnings per share (EPS) loss of 56 cents and sales of $2.60 billion. Wall Street had been looking for an EPS loss of 84 cents and revenue of $2.60 billion. A year ago, Alcoa lost 70 cents a share. In its earnings release, Alcoa’s management team said that the company is likely to ship 2.30 million tons of aluminum in 2024, which is in line with analyst estimates.Source: Carlos l Vives / Shutterstock.comThe heyday of the pandemic seems like a distant memory at biopharmaceutical company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). Owing to declining global sales of its COVID-19 vaccine, MRNA stock has fallen apart, dropping 49% in the last 12 months. The company’s share price is down nearly 80% from the peak it reached in September 2021 when its COVID-19 vaccine orders were rising. However, Moderna’s shareholders recently got some good news through an analyst upgrade.Earlier in January, MRNA stock rose 13% on news of a bullish analyst report from investment bank Oppenheimer (NYSE:OPY). The analysts at Oppenheimer upgraded Moderna’s stock to an “outperform” (buy) rating and said that the company could bring as many as five new medications to market by 2026. The investment bank is bullish about Moderna’s drug pipeline which includes an experimental vaccine that protects the elderly from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Moderna also has a flu vaccine in development, along with a cancer vaccine, both of which could come to market in the next few years, according to Oppenheimer. In its most recent earnings report, Moderna said that it expects revenue to fall to $4 billion this year before growing again in 2025.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Why Apple's iconic Super Bowl ad still resonates 4 decades later`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-apples-iconic-super-bowl-ad-still-resonates-4-decades-later-151027182.html`2024-02-10 15:10:27`"Once upon a time, believe it or not, no one particularly looked forward to Super Bowl ads.That all changed when Washington faced Los Angeles on Jan. 22, 1984, in Tampa, Fla. Those who tuned in to the big game on CBS — and hadn’t fled to the kitchen for snacks — may have been intrigued by something completely different.In between ads for Gillette Foamy Gel and Northwestern Mutual insurance, a dystopian scene appeared on their TV sets: A line of men wearing faded gray apparel marched mindlessly into a theater, where a bespectacled face, “Big Brother,” addressed them on a massive screen.Extolling the virtues of groupthink, Big Brother celebrated an imminent victory, free from “pests of any contradictory true thoughts.”Then, the camera cut to a striking blond athlete running in slow motion.Wearing a white tank top and red athletic shorts — and played by British discus thrower and actress Anya Rajah (then Anya Major) — she strode into the theater, with guards in close pursuit. She spun and, with a shout, hurled a sledgehammer at Big Brother’s face. As the screen exploded, large text appeared along with a voice narrating, “On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like '1984.'”Happy 40th to one of the greatest ads, Super Bowl or otherwise, of all time.Created by the ad agency Chiat/Day and Apple (AAPL), “1984” elevated Super Bowl ads to a whole new level. Today, tech historians, ad pros, and techies alike all look back at the commercial not only as a seminal moment in the democratization of personal computing and Super Bowl advertisements, but as a work of art containing themes that still resonate today.Though Rob Schwartz, an advertising industry leader who ran Chiat/Day from January 2015 to April 2021, was not at the agency when the ad was created, he still still remembers feeling inspired by it when it aired. “It marked the first time that the commercials in the Super Bowl were going to be something else to watch besides the game itself. This marked the moment,” he told Yahoo Finance recently.“It was,” he added, “the first time where the audience went, ‘Wait, wait, wait, don't go to the bathroom. Let's stay and watch a few commercials before the game comes back.'""But Apple, the Super Bowl aside, was in need of a boost.IBM = Big Brother?In the early 1980s, the company had established itself as a promising tech business with products like the Apple II. In an attempt to make personal computers more accessible, it had then developed the Lisa, named after Steve Jobs’ daughter. Though innovative, the computer had sold poorly, especially compared to IBM’s (IBM) PC, which was released in 1981. Meanwhile, Apple had begun working on the Macintosh, which was meant to accelerate the adoption of the personal computer by the masses.“Apple came into 1984 being walloped by IBM in the personal computing market, and needing a new big hit … the company had bet it all on the Macintosh, spending huge on its R&D, building a new state-of-the-art factory for it,” said Margaret O'Mara, the Scott and Dorothy Bullitt chair of American History at the University of Washington.But then arose the question of how to advertise the revolutionary new product. Steve Hayden, now 76, then a copywriter at Chiat/Day, still remembers receiving the assignment from Steve Jobs directly. The young tech visionary reportedly wanted to “stop the world in its tracks” and entrusted the L.A.-based firm with the job.Along with art director Brent Thomas, Hayden began brainstorming. He rifled through old ad concepts he had worked on in San Francisco and found one with the headline ""Why 1984 won't be like '1984,'"" a line Hayden attributed to fellow Chiat/Day copywriter Gary Gussick. At first, Hayden and Thomas toyed with a comical conception of 1984 “like the Jetsons.” But the ad’s director, a well-known talent by the name of Ridley Scott, had a better idea.“He came and looked at our initial board … he brought in this wonderful coffee table book about the making of Metropolis, the movie, and the dramatic huge machines and the interface between humans and these kinds of overwhelming technologies,” Hayden explained. “And so the art direction took a really sharp turn at that point to meet that vision.”The advertising experts had already come up with the Big Brother character and Scott insisted that they introduce another, a heroine who would contrast starkly with the all-male cast and ""break the spell,"" Hayden said.A new ageThe heroine symbolized more than simple rebellion against Big Brother. As historian O’Mara pointed out, the ad aired during the height of the Cold War and year of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. “I think it's telling that she's dressed as a track athlete and dressed as if she's running for the United States,"" she said.The heroine also represented the Macintosh. While computers had previously been monopolized by experts — think mainframes and IBM — the Macintosh offered a revolutionary user interface that made personal computers accessible to the mass market.“She was supposed to represent freedom and the dawning of a new age, and therefore, Macintosh,” Hayden said.Added Chiat/Day’s Schwartz: “You have to remember that this was a time when computers were only used for business … When she throws that sledgehammer, she is all of us … and she represents all of us trying to destroy any kind of tyranny or dictatorship, even if it's just a dictator for a day, we don't want that. We want to be free. And I think the power of that is the reason why people talk about it, 40 years later.”But there were some naysayers within the company. Apple's board of directors hated it and almost stopped it from airing. Meanwhile, Hayden himself felt unsure about his work. “I had my own concerns that it might be too foreign in structure and content for an American audience,” he said. “It didn't match the traditional advertising forms.”But Jean-Louis Gassée, now 79, who was then running Apple France, still recalls the first time he saw the ad at a 1983 meeting to prepare for the January launch of the Macintosh. “We had never seen advertising like this ... it was absolutely stunning. And then the lights went up a little bit and from the top of the theater machinery, a Mac came down on a wire, and halfway through the descent it [was amplified by microphones],” he told Yahoo Finance. “So we could hear what became the highly recognizable “bong” of the Mac starting. There was this hysteria in the room.”Though Hayden and the rest of his team at Chiat/Day had never specifically intended “Big Brother” to represent IBM, Jobs quickly adopted that framing. After showing the ad, Jobs gave a “fiery” anti-IBM speech, “saying that the Macintosh would change the world,” according to Gassée. “It was easy at the time to superimpose the Big Brother and the big IBM images.”Holding upIt is actually stunning to watch the ad today and see how it still holds up. Only this time, you can imagine Big Brother appearing on your screen as Tesla’s (TSLA) Elon Musk, Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and the developers of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products.At least Jean-Louis Gassée sees it that way. He asserted that the ad is still relevant as we grapple with the likes of AI and user privacy in the world of Facebook and X. It serves as “a good way to remind us of the necessary fight between established powers and upstarts.”He added: “I think the ad presents two views of technology. One that is Big Brother-like, oppressive, and one which is the Macintosh, a way to break through the domination of Big Brother technology.” he said. “So this ad in 1983, 1984, presented a view of the conflict between usages of technology. I think that that conflict is still alive.”Enjoy the Super Bowl.Dylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter.Related Quotes"`['TSLA', 'IBM', 'META', 'AAPL']`

12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-nasdaq-stocks-buy-112251252.html`2024-02-10 11:22:51`In this article, we discuss 12 best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and NASDAQ’s performance, head over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024. In December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains. The market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.The trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.Despite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.To benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Our Methodology We chose the top stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.Semiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90Micron Technology, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 102Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks for 2024. On January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.11. Revenue for the period increased 12.5% year-over-year to $8.83 billion, topping market expectations by $120 million. The global streaming paid memberships increased by 13.12 million to 260.28 million.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its CPU microprocessor market share to 18.4% in the fourth quarter, marking a gain of 73 basis points, according to data from Mercury Research cited by investment firm Citi.

(NASDAQ:AMD) was part of 110 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 112 in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.28 billion.White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a global software company operating in three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024.

(NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 134Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 7th on our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a FQ1 GAAP EPS of $2.18 and a revenue of $119.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.07 and $1.34 billion, respectively.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 135 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 915.5 million shares worth $156.75 billion.Bireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 163Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in. On January 30, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported its fourth quarter results. The GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.64 and the revenue stood at $86.31 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.04 and $1.04 billion, respectively. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has reintroduced its AI chatbot, now named Gemini, as a subscription service with different tiers, following a model similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Harris Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $3 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The FPA Crescent Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024.  Suggested articles:Top 12 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge Funds10 Best Fintech Stocks To Buy In 202411 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes`['AMD', 'AVGO', 'ADBE', 'NFLX', 'MU', 'GOOG', 'AAPL', 'AMZN']`

Ameris Bancorp (NASDAQ:ABCB) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameris-bancorp-nasdaq-abcb-q4-143343638.html`2024-01-27 14:33:43`Ameris Bancorp (NASDAQ:ABCB) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript January 26, 2024Ameris Bancorp isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Ameris Bancorp Fourth Quarter Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nicole Stokes, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.Nicole Stokes: Thank you, Chuck and thank you to all who have joined our call today. During the call, we will be referencing the press release and the financial highlights that are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at amerisbank.com. I'm joined today by Palmer Proctor, our CEO; Jon Edwards, our Chief Credit Officer; and Doug Strange, our Managing Director of Credit who will be taking over for Jon when he retires at the end of this quarter. Palmer will begin today with some general opening comments and then I will begin to discussing the details of our financial results before we open up for Q&A. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.The actual results could vary materially. We list some of the factors that might cause results to differ in our press release and in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, early developments or otherwise, except as required by law. Also during the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in reference to the company's performance. You can see our reconciliation of these measures and GAAP financial measures in the appendix to our presentation. And with that, I'll turn it over to Palmer for opening comments.Palmer Proctor: Thank you, Nicole and good morning everyone. I appreciate you taking the time to join our call today. I'm very pleased with the financial results, we reported yesterday, and I'm excited to be able to share some of the highlights in our overall strategic view for 2024 before Nicole gets into some of the financial details. 2023 was certainly a year of discipline and resilience for our company and the fourth quarter was a solid close to our plan. Throughout the year, we focused on strengthening the balance sheet to prepare ourselves for 2024 with a healthy margin, strong capital, and increased reserves. We grew deposits this year by over 6% and then controlled loan growth of 2%, improving our loan-to-deposit ratio to 98%, all while maintaining an above-peer net interest margin of 3.61% for the year.During the fourth quarter, we recorded $23 million provision for credit losses, bringing our year-to-date provision expense to over $142 million and that improves our coverage ratio up to 1.52% of loans and 365% of portfolio NPAs. And once again, this provisioning was model-driven and not related to any credit deterioration. We built and preserved capital this year such that our TCE ratio is well over our stated goal of 9% and we also grew tangible book value by over 12% this year. So, as we move into 2024, a lot of the confidence that we have is based on several factors. First, we have and will continue to fight to protect our margin and we're starting the year from a position of strength there, fortunately. We also have, as you know, a very granular deposit base, a very sticky deposit base.And then when you combine that with a well-capitalized balance sheet and a healthy allowance and obviously, as we've proven a culture of expense control, we also have a diversified revenue stream that generates above peer PPNR ROA. And last but not least, what gives us a lot of comfort too is just knowing that we have established individuals and a lot of the top growth markets throughout the Southeast. So, when it's appropriate to accelerate growth, we can do so. So, a lot of those are the main things that give us a lot of positive outlook as we look through the remainder of this year. But with that, I'll turn it over to Nicole now to discuss our financial results in more detail.Nicole Stokes: Great. Thank you, Palmer. So, for the fourth quarter, we're reporting net income of $65.9 million or $0.96 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, that's $73.6 million or $1.07 per diluted share. That brings our adjusted return on assets for the quarter to 1.15% and our adjusted return on tangible common equity of 12.81%. For the full year, we're reporting net income of $269.1 million or $3.89 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, we earned $276.3 million or $4 per diluted share. That brings our full year adjusted ROA to 1.09% and our full year adjusted ROTC to 12.55%. Excluding the FDIC special assessment, our PPNR ROA was just over 2% coming in right at 2.01%. We continue to build capital throughout the year.We ended with tangible book value of $33.64, that's a $3.72 increase or 12.4% increase from the $29.92 at the beginning of the year and the fourth quarter increase was $1.26. Our tangible common equity ratio increased to 9.64% at the end of the quarter compared to 9.11% at the end of last quarter and 8.67% at the end of last year. On the revenue side of things, interest income increased $1.7 million to $332.2 million for the quarter. And for the year, interest income increased $387 million to $1.3 billion. Our net interest income increased $34 million or just over 4% for the year and that's been one of the most aggressive interest rate cycles we've seen in history. Our margin remains above peer and was stable this quarter at 3.54%, and we're encouraged by that.Beta catch-up was about eight basis points this quarter and was completely absorbed by our positive deposit mix and our asset yield. We were able to pay off about $1 billion of wholesale funding during the quarter, with that being about $700 million of FHLB advances and $324 million of brokered CDs. We continue to be very close to neutral on asset liability sensitivity, which positions us very well for the next Fed decision, whatever and whenever that is. We've updated our interest rate sensitivity information on Slide 11 in the presentation. Our non-interest income for the quarter decreased about $6.9 million, mostly in the mortgage division due to the normal fourth quarter seasonality. But the good news there from a profitability standpoint is their non-interest expense declined in step with that decline in income as they do a great job managing their variable costs.And as a company, we once again did a great job this quarter. Our adjusted expenses primarily excluding the $11.6 million FDIC assessment, decreased $2.1 million, almost all those variable expenses in the mortgage divisions as I just mentioned. That brought our adjusted efficiency ratio to 52.87% for the quarter and 52.58% for the year. We continue to look for expense reduction opportunities. And although there's always a cyclical first quarter bumps, we still believe we can maintain an efficiency ratio below 55% next year -- or this year 2024, even with the low single-digit non-interest expense increases this year. On the balance sheet side, we ended the year with total assets of $25.2 billion compared to $25.7 billion last quarter and $25.1 billion last year.Loans increased $68 million this quarter and $414 million for the year. Deposits grew $118 million during the quarter and $1.2 billion for the year. Non-interest-bearing deposits still represent 31% of our total deposits and represent just a minimal decline over last quarter. We do anticipate 2024 loan and deposit growth to increase to mid-single digits, in line with our prior guidance.

Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbott-laboratories-abt-trending-stock-140006816.html`2024-02-09 14:00:06`Abbott (ABT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this maker of infant formula, medical devices and drugs have returned -0.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Products industry, which Abbott falls in, has gained 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Abbott is expected to post earnings of $0.97 per share, indicating a change of -5.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.8%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.12 indicates a change of +11.1% from what Abbott is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Abbott is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Abbott, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $41.78 billion and $44.75 billion estimates indicate +4.2% and +7.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAbbott reported revenues of $10.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.5%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.71%. The EPS surprise was 0%.Over the last four quarters, Abbott surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Abbott is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Abbott. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Insulet's (PODD) Omnipod 5 Gets CE Mark for Added Compatibility`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insulets-podd-omnipod-5-gets-145200403.html`2024-02-08 14:52:00`Insulet Corporation PODD recently received CE mark approval under the European Medical Device Regulation for the added compatibility of the Abbott Laboratories’ ABT FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor with its Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System. It is applicable for individuals aged two years and above with type 1 diabetes.The Omnipod 5 System consists of the tubeless Pod enhanced with SmartAdjust Technology and the Omnipod 5 Controller with its integrated Smartbolus Calculator.Insulet expects Omnipod 5 integration with the Abbott FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor to be available first in the U.K. and Netherlands in a phased launch in the first half of 2024. Additional markets are expected to follow.With the latest regulatory approval, Insulet is expected to solidify its foothold in the global continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) business.Per Insulet, Omnipod 5 is currently the first and only tubeless hybrid closed loop system (also known as automated insulin delivery) that is approved for CE marking and integrated with two CGM sensor brands, Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre and Dexcom.Insulet’s management believes that the addition of the Abbott FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor to its CGM compatibility will likely expand the accessibility of Omnipod 5 and serve more people who have diabetes.Per a report by Grand View Research, the global CGM device market size was valued at $4.60 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $7.51 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of approximately 7.2%. Factors like the rising cases of diabetes and the increasing adoption of CGM devices are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory approval is expected to provide a significant boost to Insulet’s business globally.In November 2023, Insulet reported its third-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a robust uptick in its top and bottom lines. The company’s performance benefited as a result of the continued high demand for Omnipod 5 both in the United States and globally. The company commercially launched Omnipod 5 in Germany — the second European Omnipod 5 launch — with the intent to launch Omnipod 5 more broadly across Europe starting in 2024.In October, Insulet received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the Omnipod 5 App for iPhone.Shares of Insulet have lost 30.6% in the past year against the industry’s 6.2% rise and the S&P 500's 22.9% growth.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, Insulet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA and Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI.DaVita, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has an estimated long-term growth rate of 17.3%.

New Study Shows Mixed Reality Technology for Blood Donation From Abbott and Blood Centers of America Helps Ease Stress, Encourages People To Donate Again`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/study-shows-mixed-reality-technology-133000059.html`2024-02-08 13:30:00`"Mixed reality experience allows blood donors to visit a digital world while remaining fully aware of their surroundings for a safe, relaxing donation68.4% of pilot study participants who reported pre-donation anxiety said the mixed reality experience helped ease feelings of anxiety89.2% of donors who tried mixed reality said they were likely to donate blood againInnovation is designed to attract new donors and motivate a younger generation to give bloodABBOTT PARK, IL / ACCESSWIRE / February 8, 2024 / AbbottA new study published online and available in the February print edition of the journal Transfusion shows the mixed reality technology for use during blood donation created by Abbott (NYSE:ABT) and Blood Centers of America (BCA) helps ease donors' feelings of anxiety and boosts the likelihood they will return to give blood again.Results from the pilot study reveal that mixed reality ""is an innovative technology that holds promise to increase donor engagement, satisfaction, and retention,"" researchers said.Abbott, the global leader in screening blood and plasma, partnered with Blood Centers of America, the largest blood supplier network in the U.S., to launch a mixed reality experience for blood donors in June 2023. It is now available at several donation sites across the country, including in New York, Houston and the Chicago area. More blood donation sites will offer the experience soon.The Abbott and BCA mixed reality innovation is an immersive digital experience designed to improve the blood donation process, attract new donors and motivate a younger generation to give blood. Donors wear lightweight mixed reality headsets to visit a digital world while remaining fully aware of their real-world surroundings. The effort aims to address the global challenge of sustaining a reliable blood supply.The pilot study examined the experiences of 282 blood donors who tried mixed reality at 54 collection sites in Houston and the Quad Cities area in Iowa and Illinois.Of the 142 donors who reported pre-donation anxiety, 68.4% said the use of mixed reality during donation decreased their reported anxiety. The top reported causes of pre-donation anxiety were fear that donation would hurt, fear of feeling badly after donating, fear of needles, fear of fainting and fear of the unknown.For donors who tried mixed reality while donating, 89.2% said they wanted to come back to donate again.""We found that using mixed reality while donating blood helps many donors relax and decreases stress,"" said Theodore Kieffer, MD, U.S. area medical director for Abbott's transfusion business and a co-author of the study. ""It's encouraging to see this innovation improve the blood donation experience and potentially inspire a younger generation to become donors.""The mixed reality experience allows blood donation professionals to safely conduct the donation and interact with donors at every step of the process. Because the mixed reality glasses are transparent, donors' eyes are always visible during donation to ensure constant monitoring and evaluation.The mixed reality experience was designed based on research that natural settings are the most preferred environment as donors give blood. Participants visit a whimsical virtual garden while listening to soothing music, moving a cursor with their eye movement and planting seeds that grow into colorful trees and flowers.The innovation was designed to help boost the sustainability of the nation's blood supply and attract younger people since blood centers have lost about 30% of donors under the age of 30 over the last decade. On average, only 3% of the eligible U.S. population donates blood each year.In the pilot study, 54% of donors with baseline reported anxiety said they would use mixed reality again, with the highest future interest in young donors.""The adoption of mixed reality in blood donation is a significant innovation, particularly for attracting new donors. By making the donation process more engaging and less intimidating, this innovation can play a crucial role in increasing the blood supply,"" said Jennifer Kapral, senior vice president at Blood Centers of America and a co-author of the study. ""Mixed reality helps modernize the donation experience and also potentially increases the frequency and number of younger donors. It can really make a difference to get more people interested in donating and making it more fun when they do.""Mixed reality is part of Abbott and BCA's broader, ongoing effort to energize younger people to donate blood, motivate first-time donors and cultivate a new generation to help sustain the nation's blood supply. In 2023, the combination of those efforts helped increase donations 11% among 16-24 year olds.The pilot study was conducted at sites operated by Impact Life of Davenport, Iowa, and Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center in Houston during February and March 2023. Researchers affiliated with Stanford University and Stanford Blood Center, Johns Hopkins University and the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Abbott, Blood Centers of America, Impact Life and Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center conducted and authored the study.To find out more about donation locations offering mixed reality visit bethe1donor.com/mixedreality.About Abbott:Abbott is a global healthcare leader that helps people live more fully at all stages of life.

Invest with Confidence: Intrinsic Value Unveiled of Abbott Laboratories`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-confidence-intrinsic-value-unveiled-110152314.html`2024-02-07 11:01:52`In this article, we will take a look into Abbott Laboratories's (NYSE:ABT) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CMCSA.As of 2024-02-07, Abbott Laboratories's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $100.14. It's currently trading at a price of $114. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -13.84%. The company is fair valued.The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Abbott Laboratories's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.TermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$4.16GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.12%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 16.10% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.Growth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=53.74Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=46.4Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=100.14GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $36.49. This valuation indicates that the Abbott Laboratories is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -212.41%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

(Nasdaq: ACET), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases, today provided corporate updates and highlighted upcoming priorities for its pipeline programs in 2024.""In 2024, we aim to make significant strides across our pipeline of differentiated gamma delta T cell therapies through our strategic and disciplined approach,"" said Chen Schor, President and Chief Executive Officer at Adicet Bio. ""The U.S. FDA’s IND clearance of ADI-001 in lupus nephritis marks an important milestone in maximizing the ADI-001 opportunity in the autoimmune therapeutic category that we believe it is ideally suited to address. Clinical data for ADI-001 have demonstrated B-cell depletion that mirrors the B cell depletion by autologous alpha-beta CAR T in academic clinical studies in systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy patients. Given that gamma delta 1 T cells preferentially traffic to organs and tissues, ADI-001 is designed to target and deplete B cells in the periphery, secondary lymphoid organs, kidneys, and other organs, which is highly desirable in autoimmune diseases. ADI-001’s off-the-shelf availability and the favorable safety profile provide the potential for outpatient administration.""Mr. Schor continued: ""Our internal research and development efforts are focused in areas where we believe we have a high probability of success and opportunity for significant differentiation. In our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of ADI-001 in relapsed or refractory NHL, we have decided to focus our current patient enrollment on the MCL population, which demonstrated the greatest clinical benefit in our June 2023 clinical update. With projected cash runway into the second half of 2025, multiple upcoming milestones, and a disciplined approach, we believe we are well-positioned to advance our pipeline of allogeneic T cell therapy candidates to address substantial unmet needs in oncology and autoimmune diseases.""Program Updates and Expected Milestones for 2024ADI-001 is an investigational allogeneic gamma delta CAR T cell therapy targeting CD20 for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) and autoimmune diseases.Autoimmune diseasesIND cleared for lupus nephritis. In December 2023, the FDA cleared Adicet’s IND application for ADI-001 in lupus nephritis.Initiate Phase 1 clinical trial of ADI-001 for the treatment of lupus nephritis in the second quarter of 2024. The Company plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of ADI-001 in lupus nephritis and may provide a clinical update from the trial in the second half of 2024. Adicet expects to expand into additional autoimmune indications in the near future.Hematologic malignanciesFocus enrollment on MCL patients in ongoing Phase 1 GLEAN study. Adicet will focus on the MCL patient population in the ongoing Phase 1 GLEAN study (at dose level 4), which experienced the greatest clinical benefit in the June 2023 update. While these were early data, an 80% CR rate and 60% 6-month CR rate in late line MCL patients were reported in the June 2023 clinical update, Cmax and exposure by area under the curve (AUC) exceeded that of approved autologous CD19 CAR T therapies, and a favorable safety profile was observed with no significant risk of cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome or T-cell malignancies. These initial clinical results, coupled with the potential to dose off-the-shelf in a community setting, support ADI-001 as a potentially attractive therapy for MCL patients. The Company is evaluating the option of advancing ADI-001 to a potentially pivotal study in MCL patients under an accelerated approval pathway.The Company remains on track to provide an ADI-001 clinical update in the second half of 2024.ADI-270 is an investigational allogeneic gamma delta CAR T cell therapy targeting CD70 via the CD27-ligand for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma with potential in other solid tumor indications. ADI-270 is designed to home to solid tumors, with a highly specific targeting moiety for CD70 and an armoring technology of TGF beta dominant- negative receptor to address immunosuppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment. Building on gamma delta 1 tissue tropism to solid tumors and three mechanisms of anti-tumor activity (CAR, innate and adaptive), CAR gamma delta 1 T cells may be well positioned to address solid tumors.Renal cell carcinomaPlan to file IND for ADI-270 in 2Q 2024. Following positive feedback from a pre-IND meeting with the FDA, the Company remains on track to file an IND application for ADI-270 in the second quarter of 2024.Financial OutlookThe Company expects cash and cash equivalents on hand as of December 31, 2023, to enable funding for current and planned operations into the second half of 2025.Webcast/ Conference Call InformationThe live webcast of the presentation can be accessed by registering under ""Presentations & Events"" in the investors section of the Company’s website at https://www.adicetbio.com.

Leading the Adoption of 5G Spectrum Harmonization can Unlock up to $200B in U.S. Economic Growth, According to New Report`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leading-adoption-5g-spectrum-harmonization-150000001.html`2024-02-07 15:00:00`"WASHINGTON, Feb. 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Allocating internationally harmonized mid-band spectrum for 5G can unlock approximately $200B to America's economy over the next 10 years, according to a new study by Accenture (NYSE: ACN) commissioned by CTIA, the wireless industry association. There is a risk of America's wireless industry limiting its ""future leadership of the global wireless ecosystem"" if embracing 5G spectrum allocation is not fully supported. This could also impact adjacent industries that leverage wireless technology such as manufacturing, utilities, and others in the U.S., the study finds.The report, Advancing U.S. Wireless Excellence: The Case for Global Spectrum Harmonization, finds that spectrum harmonization is key to achieving ""economies of scale across the wireless value chain as well as fueling new sources of growth and innovation."" While most countries are rapidly coalescing around a set of internationally harmonized bands to support their 5G networks and realize these benefits, the U.S. has less spectrum than its international peers, including China, and no plans to free up additional 5G spectrum in the near term.""As we saw at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), the rest of the world is moving quickly to allocate significant amounts of internationally harmonized mid-band spectrum for 5G to meet exploding demand and build a foundation for future innovation and economic growth,"" said Meredith Attwell Baker, President and CEO, CTIA. ""To avoid becoming a wireless technology island and secure our economic competitiveness, it is critical that we move quickly to allocate more full power, licensed spectrum for 5G with global bands.""According to the study, the U.S. can secure its wireless leadership and achieve significant economic benefits by leading the adoption of internationally harmonized spectrum bands. Leading spectrum harmonization also benefits American consumers by lowering the cost of wireless products and services, accelerating the development of innovative 5G use cases and supporting the continued growth and development of trusted network infrastructure companies.""Remediating its mid-band spectrum deficit will be imperative for the U.S. to fuel new sources of growth and innovation. Ignoring this opportunity now can jeopardize the wireless leadership it achieved in 4G, and in the early phase of 5G's rollout,"" said Tejas Rao, managing director, Accenture Cloud First Networks. ""Taking calculated and swift action is necessary to position the U.S. at the forefront of wireless innovation and lay the foundation for future growth.""The U.S. should focus its efforts on freeing up mid-band spectrum for full-power, licensed 5G use that will fuel use cases ranging from 5G home broadband, smart manufacturing, precision agriculture, and more.The two bands that stand out given recent developments at the WRC globally and their inclusion in the National Spectrum Strategy domestically are:The lower 3 GHz band is already harmonized and widely used around the world, making it the ideal spectrum to start catching up with the rest of the world on mid-band 5G allocations.The 7/8 GHz band, which is slated for future mobile use internationally, gives the U.S. a clear opportunity to lead in developing the wireless ecosystem using this next key spectrum band.The study highlights that leading the adoption of key spectrum bands could drive up to $200B in U.S. economic growth over the next ten years. This includes more than $150B from new jobs, leadership in new industries, strengthening America's export market and accelerating America's global economic competitiveness. An additional $44B would come from taking advantage of economies of scale in network equipment and device production.Leading the adoption of internationally harmonized bands will also support the U.S.' goal of securing its network equipment supply chain, according to Accenture, by enabling trusted equipment manufacturers to take advantage of global economies of scale and compete on a more level playing field with Chinese equipment manufacturers.A copy of the report can be downloaded here.About CTIACTIA® (www.ctia.org) represents the U.S. wireless communications industry and the companies throughout the mobile ecosystem that enable Americans to lead a 21st century connected life.

Inside the shifting plan at Elon Musk’s X to build a new team and police a platform ‘so toxic it’s almost unrecognizable’`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-shifting-plan-elon-musk-230907908.html`2024-02-06 23:09:07`"In the spring of 2023, when X was still called Twitter, the company began planning a new system to keep the most undesirable content off of its platform.In place of the army of contract workers that policed most social media sites, including Twitter, the company would build its own, smaller, in-house team of content moderators — a specialized safety net to prevent the most egregious stuff from slipping through without crimping too much on Twitter owner Elon Musk's outspoken commitment to ""free speech.""Last week, nearly one year later, X announced a new Trust and Safety Center of Excellence in Austin, Texas. The 100-person team of content moderators touted by an X representative in a Bloomberg news report is significantly smaller than the 500-person team that was initially envisioned, according to a former trust and safety staffer. And it’s unclear if X has hired more than a dozen or so people so far.Still, at a time when lawmakers are turning up the heat on social media companies for endangering children, X's safety center in Austin has clear PR value. The new center will ""bring more agents in house to accelerate our impact,"" X CEO Linda Yaccarino said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday.While some critics took note of the opportunistic timing of the announcement, the details of X’s Austin plan raise a bigger question about the Musk-owned platform: Could Musk’s unconventional approach to content moderation outperform the social media industry's woeful track record of online safety, or does it represent just another means to cut costs by an organization with little interest in deciding which content is appropriate for its users.According to several content moderation experts and current or former X insiders that Fortune spoke to, a team of in-house specialists could provide significant advantages compared to the current industry norms. But many also stressed the importance of a coherent underlying policy and investments in tools and technology.“X+100 is better than just X, in terms of moderation capacity,” a source familiar with trust and safety at X explained. But, the person continued, “the number of humans at computers matters less, in some ways, than having clear policies rooted in proven harm reduction strategies, and the tools and systems necessary to implement those policies at scale — both of which have been dismantled since late 2022.”X did not respond to requests for an interview or to comment for this story.The flood of problematic content on X has become a frequent topic of public debate—and disputes— since Musk’s $44 billion acquisition closed in November 2022.After the Center for Countering Digital Hate published a report claiming that X failed to moderate ""extreme hate speech,"" Musk sued the group for doing calculated harm with ""baseless claims."" Meanwhile videos of graphic animal abuse have spread widely on the platform, according to reports. And just last week explicit, AI-generated content featuring Taylor Swift circulated unchecked for 17 hours until the platform shut down the ability to search for her name at all.X also leans heavily on its Community Notes feature, which allows approved users to add a note to posts with additional context, to moderate its millions of active users, the former trust and safety staffer said. But the person emphasized that this is merely ""one tool"" that should be used for moderation. What's more, a Wired investigation uncovered coordinated efforts within the feature to propagate disinformation, highlighting a lack of significant oversight from the company.By some estimates Musk has cut 80% of the engineers dedicated to trust and safety and thinned the ranks of outsourced content moderators whose job it is to monitor and remove content that violates the company’s policies. In July, Yaccarino announced to staff that three leaders would oversee various aspects of trust and safety, such as law enforcement operations and threat disruptions, Reuters reported. However, according to another source at X, it's unclear where T&S stands within the organization's hierarchy, noting that the group doesn't appear to be ""at the top level anymore.""However, within Musk’s social media company, there also has been an effort to rethink how the job is done.The new Austin center actually began as a Bay Area center. The intention was to establish the center in a city like San Francisco, which would help recruit top-tier multilingual talent—crucial for countering Internet trolls, since more than 80% of X’s user base don’t live in the U.S., a source familiar with trust and safety under Musk told Fortune. Given the nuances of individual languages, and the idioms and expressions unique to each one, the idea was that someone familiar with a specific language or culture could, for example, better distinguish a joke from a threat than could a low-paid generalist contract worker with no specialized skills.“They actually started this by hiring people in the Bay Area to test their quality level and whether or not it would work better than having it outsourced,” the former staffer said. “[X] hired a small team of people and tested it out and their ability to make accurate decisions.” The plan called for starting with 75 staffers and to eventually scale it to a 500-person team if it delivered results.However, Musk, at that time, leaned towards a more cost-effective location, favoring Austin, because he was certain in his ability to attract and potentially relocate individuals proficient in various languages. The change has added a few wrinkles to the project.“Having to hire hundreds of people and get them up and running and trained and all that is a roughly two to three month process,” the former X staffer explained. “Then you start training and so you know, realistically you're looking at three, four or five months before you get a team in place. That assumes the job market is awesome, right? And you don't have to relocate people and all of that fun stuff.”According to LinkedIn, a dozen recruits have joined X as “trust and safety agents” in Austin over the last month — and most appeared to have moved from Accenture, a firm that provides content moderation contractors to Internet companies. It's not clear if X has a contract-to-hire plan in place with Accenture—whereby workers retained by consulting firms like Accenture are given full-time roles at a client company when there’s a good fit—but the source confirmed that X has used Accenture’s contracting services in the past.There are a lot of questions about what exactly the Austin team will focus on. Will they focus on content involving only minors, or only in the U.S.? Will they focus on individual posts, or conduct investigations into sexual exploitation?""100 people in Austin would be one tiny node in what needs to be a global content moderation network,” former Twitter trust and safety council member Anne Collier told Fortune. “100 people in Austin, I wish them luck”Whatever their task, social media moderation experts agree that the company will need to make a significant investment in AI tools for the team to be most effective.Facebook for example employed about 15,000 moderators globally in 2020 when it announced it was “marrying AI and human reviewers to make less total mistakes,” the Verge reported at the time. Snap operates similarly, stating in a blog post that it uses “a combination of automated tools and human review to moderate.”According to the former X insider, the company has experimented with AI moderation. And Musk’s latest push into artificial intelligence technology through X.AI, a one-year old startup that’s developed its own large language model, could provide a valuable resource for the team of human moderators.An AI system “can tell you in about roughly three seconds for each of those tweets, whether they're in policy or out of policy, and by the way, they're at the accuracy levels about 98% whereas with human moderators, no company has better accuracy level than like 65%,” the source said. “You kind of want to see at the same time in parallel what you can do with AI versus just humans and so I think they're gonna see what that right balance is.”But no matter how good the AI tools and the moderators, the performance is only as good as the policy that drives it, and that’s an area where X has struggled under Musk.Policies need to be flexible enough to adapt to cultural contexts, but they also need to be sufficiently predictable for everyone to understand what the rules are, the source familiar with trust and safety at X explained. This is especially important when moderating content on a large platform ""where hundreds or even thousands of moderators have to understand and interpret a stable set of rules. You can't implement rules consistently and accurately if they're constantly shifting,"" the person said.The loosening of the rules, and the resulting lack of clarity, has been one constant at X under Musk’s stewardship.After Musk’s takeover, he went on to reinstate a slate of accounts that were banned for breaking the platform’s policies: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene violated COVID-19 misinformation policies, the Babylon Bee posted a transphobic story that violated Twitter's hateful conduct policy, Andrew Tate (banned from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok) was banned for saying that women should bear ""some responsibility"" for being sexually assaulted. All these people were reinstated under Musk.Some outlets speculated there was a link between the exit of Ella Irwin—the final head of trust and safety during Musk's tenure—and Musk's criticism of the team's decision to remove Matt Walsh's transphobic ""What is a Woman?"" documentary, a violation of X's rules. Despite the violation of X’s written policy, Musk insisted the documentary stay up.“It's not obvious to me that X moderates in accordance with policies at all anymore. The site's rules as published online seem to be a pretextual smokescreen to mask its owner ultimately calling the shots in whatever way he sees it,” the source familiar with X moderation added.Julie Inman Grant, a former Twitter trust and safety council member who is now suing the company for for lack of transparency over CSAM, is more blunt in her assessment: “You cannot just put your finger back in the dike to stem a tsunami of child sexual expose - or a flood of deepfake porn proliferating the platform,” she said.“In my experience at Twitter from 2014 to 2016, it took literally years to build this expertise - and it will take much more than that to make a meaningful change to a platform that has become so toxic it is almost unrecognizable.”Do you have insight to share?

The 3 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Invest In for Big Gains in 2024`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks-134507369.html`2024-02-02 13:45:07`The rapid emergence of artificial intelligence has confounded both skeptics and believers. The shift from obscurity in 2021 to widespread adoption and investment has been unprecedented. Today, we are in an AI race with the best AI stocks positioned to serve this innovation.While some market participants believe AI is overhyped, the significant strides should not be ignored. Here are some examples of how AI is permeating various industries. Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) is using artificial intelligence to help detect and prevent financial crimes. In molecular medicine, scientists are using the technology to simulate molecular interactions from vast data sets to formulate potential drugs.Technology companies are experiencing breakthrough moments, as ServiceNow (NASDAQ:NOW) CEO Bill McDermott highlighted in Q4 2023 results. “Generative AI is injecting new fuel into our already high performing engine. ServiceNow’s intelligent platform for end to end digital transformation is driving massive leaps in productivity and explosive growth,” he noted.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAccording to McKinsey’s estimation, generative AI will add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion of value across 63 use cases the firm analyzed. The best AI stocks are critical in helping AI achieve its potential. So far, these companies have shown they are ready to spearhead this revolution.Source: Tada Images/ShutterStock.comSome of the best AI stocks are companies helping enterprises move from AI experimentation to implementation. This consulting giant has embraced AI in its business and is assisting clients to adopt the technology. In June 2023, it announced a $3 billion investment in its Data & AI practice to support its customers in applying AI for growth and productivity.Accenture (NYSE:ACN) sees unprecedented demand and is ready to pounce on the opportunity. It has been a leader in AI and has over 1,450 patents and pending applications. Today, it is applying its expertise to help clients in retail, manufacturing, and other industries adopt and scale AI solutions.Recognizing the power of generative AI in personalization, the firm has launched several specialized services. These capabilities enable enterprises to modify and manage foundational models. The company’s proprietary switchboard allows users to select a combination of various models for their unique needs and context.For Accenture, AI isn’t just a dream. The firm has swung into action and is already seeing results. In the last fiscal year, it had $300 million in GenAI sales. The company is off to an impressive start this fiscal year, delivering over $450 million in bookings in Q1 FY2024 alone.The firm continues to strengthen its advanced center for AI. Moreover, it aims to increase its AI experts from 40,000 to 80,000. Today, under 10% of companies have advanced AI capabilities, and Accenture will be central to helping companies reinvent their businesses with generative AI.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comOver the past year, the market hasn’t appreciated the potential of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in AI as much as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The retail and cloud giant remains one of the best AI stocks due to the several levers it can pull in AI.First, the firm applies AI in its online marketplace to enhance its recommendation engine. As a result, customers can see products based on their preferences and browsing history, increasing conversions. A good example is how Amazon Fashion is improving the customer experience for shoppers. Its machine learning and AI models help to recommend the best fit and style to customers.Secondly, Amazon is leveraging AI in other ways in its retail business. For instance, the company is improving its inventory management using generative AI’s predictive capabilities. It’s also utilizing the technology for workforce management and routine task automation, improving productivity.Thirdly, its cloud division, Amazon Web Services, makes it one of the best AI stocks. AWS has integrated AI to create bespoke solutions for various industries. For instance, retailers rely on solutions such as Amazon Personalize and Amazon Forecast for customer personalization and business planning, respectively.Also, AWS is providing the computing power and capabilities to train and deploy AI models through Amazon Bedrock. Many organizations are using Amazon’s cloud service to train their foundational models. Organizations like Booking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Perplexity AI have launched their GenAI applications on AWS.Due to the soaring demand, AWS revenues could reaccelerate in 2024. The division will increase growth due to AI demand after a slowdown in 2023 due to cost optimizations. AMZN stock is one of the best artificial intelligence stocks considering this tailwind.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is an underappreciated AI play in the shadows of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). The semiconductor company has a thriving data center business, mainly in artificial intelligence.In the latest quarter, Q3 FY2024, data center revenues were up 21% quarter-over-quarter. Although the company sees softer demand in other end markets, AI and cloud are a bright spot. “The diversification of our portfolio is serving us well, with strong growth from AI and cloud carrying us through a softening demand environment in other end markets,” noted CEO Matt Murphy.Looking at the overall performance, the AI business is becoming a significant portion of revenues. It exited 2023 with over $200 million in quarterly revenues from AI. Management maintains that this business will be a robust grower in 2024. Its optical solutions are part of every AI cluster deployment, which will support data center segment growth.Analysts have also embraced this bullish view on MRVL stock and consider it one of the best AI stocks. On January 19, Citi reiterated its “buy” rating and ranked it the top pick in the specialty semiconductor industry. Analysts like it as a continued beneficiary of AI and forecast more AI project sales. Furthermore, they expect a boost as non-cloud markets recover in 2024.Marvell fits the bill if you are looking for an undiscovered artificial intelligence stock. With 25 “buy ratings,” the stock is headed for big gains in 2024. Besides, a recovery in the consumer and enterprise networking markets after 2023’s downturn will boost the stock.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Accenture will leverage Tenchi’s SaaS platform as a new component of its managed security services offering to help organizations reduce cyber risks across their supply chain.Based in São Paulo, Brazil, Tenchi Security’s SaaS platform gives organizations better visibility into their supply chains risks by continuously monitoring relationships with suppliers. Unlike other enterprise cyber risk management providers in the market, Tenchi’s approach provides a holistic view of an organization’s cyber risk profile through a comprehensive risk assessment.Recent cyberattacks have exposed how greater interconnectivity, network access and ecosystem vulnerabilities can affect even the most secure businesses. In fact, Accenture’s Cyber-Resilient CEO research found that around half (51%) of CEOs ranked supply chain as the second highest external risk, underscoring the vulnerabilities of global organizations across their value chains.""Supply chain security attacks are happening all too often when security is not embedded at the core of the business and across suppliers,"" said Paolo Dal Cin, global lead of Accenture Security. ""This is particularly concerning when more than half of executives say their organizations have an insufficient understanding of cyber vulnerabilities in their supply chain. To address this issue, Tenchi and Accenture will offer organizations a complete supply chain risk management security solution that will allow them to identify cyber risks faster and assist in addressing cyber threats.""Felipe Boucas, CEO of Tenchi, said, ""While there is a growing awareness of the need to manage cybersecurity risks across a company’s supply chain, there is a lack of verified, integrated and continuous data and effective remediation. With Accenture’s deep experience in managed security services, we will help organizations build trust between their business, suppliers, and partners, while offering ways to improve upon their cybersecurity and the cyber hygiene of the ecosystem as a whole.""Tenchi Security is the latest company to join Accenture Ventures’ Project Spotlight, an engagement and investment program that targets emerging technology companies that can help fill strategic innovation gaps for Global 2000 organizations.

12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-nasdaq-stocks-buy-112251252.html`2024-02-10 11:22:51`In this article, we discuss 12 best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and NASDAQ’s performance, head over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024. In December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains. The market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.The trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.Despite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.To benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Our Methodology We chose the top stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Photo by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global semiconductor company specializing in the design and development of complex digital and mixed-signal semiconductor devices. It operates in two segments – Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has projected a 2024 outlook with anticipated revenue of $50 billion and EBITDA margins of 60%. The company acknowledged some cyclical challenges in its broadband and storage semiconductor businesses but anticipates strength in the latter part of the year. Despite expected headwinds in the first half of 2024, investment advisory firm Summit Insights Group upgraded Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock to Buy on December 8, expressing confidence that the company will likely outperform its outlook for 2024.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), with 2 million shares worth $1.70 billion. Overall, 87 hedge funds were bullish on the stock. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to monitor. ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.Semiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a global company engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and sale of memory and storage products. The company operates through four segments – Compute and Networking Business Unit, Mobile Business Unit, Embedded Business Unit, and Storage Business Unit. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy. J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur, with an Overweight rating, raised the price target on the stock to $105 from $90 on December 21. He emphasized the significance of high-bandwidth memory products, anticipating them to be a substantial revenue driver in 2024, driven by increased demand for memory in AI projects.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 90 hedge funds were bullish on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 86 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the leading position holder in the company, with 8.10 million shares worth $551.6 million.Here is what Claret Asset Management has to say about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 102Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks for 2024. On January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.11. Revenue for the period increased 12.5% year-over-year to $8.83 billion, topping market expectations by $120 million. The global streaming paid memberships increased by 13.12 million to 260.28 million. Netflix revealed Q1 2024 guidance, indicating anticipated revenue of $9.24 billion compared to the consensus estimate of $9.26 billion, and projected earnings per share (EPS) of $4.49 as opposed to the consensus estimate of $4.14.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 102 hedge funds were bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), compared to 114 funds in the preceding quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is one of the biggest stakeholders of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth over $970 million. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its CPU microprocessor market share to 18.4% in the fourth quarter, marking a gain of 73 basis points, according to data from Mercury Research cited by investment firm Citi. Citi holds a Buy rating on AMD as of February 7. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was part of 110 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 112 in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.28 billion.White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a global software company operating in three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024.

(NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 134Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 7th on our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a FQ1 GAAP EPS of $2.18 and a revenue of $119.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.07 and $1.34 billion, respectively.

The dividend is payable on February 15, to shareholders of record on February 12. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 134 hedge funds were bullish on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 135 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 915.5 million shares worth $156.75 billion.Bireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 163Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in. On January 30, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported its fourth quarter results. The GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.64 and the revenue stood at $86.31 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.04 and $1.04 billion, respectively. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has reintroduced its AI chatbot, now named Gemini, as a subscription service with different tiers, following a model similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024.  Suggested articles:Top 12 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge Funds10 Best Fintech Stocks To Buy In 202411 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes`['AMD', 'AVGO', 'ADBE', 'NFLX', 'MU', 'GOOG', 'AAPL', 'AMZN']`

11 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-faang-stocks-invest-215344511.html`2024-02-09 21:53:44`"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best FAANG stocks to invest in. To skip our detailed analysis of the tech industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In.The technology sector has been on a steady rise for quite a while now, and the most obvious answer to the industry's propulsion to greater and greater heights is the ongoing obsession with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Many within the AI space today are large tech companies, such as the FAANG names. These days, however, a new moniker has been on the rise to identify the best tech companies of the day: the Magnificent Seven.The original cohort of tech names to keep an eye on included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), all coming together to form the FAANG group. Today, these companies are challenged by several others in the market, particularly semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA isn't alone either, and so the original list of FAANG stocks has had to accommodate the rise of new and old mega-tech companies bolstered by the emergence of AI.Regardless of what you call these companies or who joins these new exciting groups, the fact remains that the tech sector has been abuzz with news of innovations, rising investments, and higher profitability. At the end of the day, it's starting to look like tech companies really are starting to rule the world.On February 8, Gene Munster, the managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss recent trends in the tech sector and the rise of FAANG stocks, particularly Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here's what he had to say:""They have the biggest upside potential relative to where expectations are... these three, I think, are largely unappreciated. I just wanna start with Meta. I think it's the biggest AI opportunity that's misunderstood. Most investors understand that Meta is using AI to improve ad campaigns, ad attribution... but there is a significant underappreciated lever that could take this into a whole different atmosphere. This theory comes from Deepwater's Doug Clinton. He believes that ultimately, they will monetize Llama. Llama is an opensource model. The other foundation models, Claude, and ChatGPT, and Gemini, they're all closed. Llama has 30 million downloads. If they monetize this, they will likely announce a cloud infrastructure... that is a whole new shift, and new benefit to Meta.""On the rise of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, Munster said the following:""Apple's gonna come out with their own foundation model likely in June, and they're gonna allow this to do personalized AI. This is really gonna capture 20% of the world's interest, and they can charge $10 a month for this.""Most investors have been overlooking Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, but Munster thinks the company is on its way to benefitting from a new opportunity.In an additional boost for the tech sector, the Biden Administration has announced a $5 billion investment in chips, a move that is bound to uplift the semiconductor industry. On February 9, Ronnie Chatterji, professor at Duke University and former White House Chips Coordinator, joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss this move. He noted that this move signals a partnership between the public and private sectors to ensure that the US continues to lead ""in the current generation of chips"" alongside the ""next generation."" The investment is thus being welcomed overwhelmingly and may signal greater things for semiconductor companies in 2024.With the current situation being so overwhelmingly in favor of tech companies, we have compiled a list of the best FAANG stocks to buy now. These include some of the top American tech stocks to buy apart from the original FAANG stocks.A technician at a workstation, preparing and calibrating a sensor for automotive microcontrollers.Our Methodology We compiled our list of the best FAANG stocks to invest in by consulting Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the third quarter and selecting major tech companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”Like Meta Platforms, Inc.

25 Best States for Job Seekers Right Now`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-best-states-job-seekers-164635446.html`2024-02-08 16:46:35`In this article, we will take a look at the 25 best states for job seekers right now. If you want to skip our discussion, you can go directly to the 5 Best States for Job Seekers Right Now.The job market around the world is changing with new work dynamics and the involvement of AI. Increasing hybrid work models and remote jobs are defining a new era for jobs and how employers need to find the best fit for the company. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the US labor market recorded 8.6 million occupational shifts, with most people looking to work from home. AI is going to create jobs and people will have to go through occupational transitions to find relevant jobs in the coming years. According to a study by McKinsey, current activities that account for almost 30% of hours worked across the US could be automated by 2030 - mainly driven by generative AI. In addition, 12 million occupational transitions may be necessary by 2030. The US states with the most competitive job markets also tend to be the hardest states to find a job. California, Illinois, and New York are competitive marketplaces with high unemployment rates of 5.1%, 4.8%, and 4.5%, respectively. Due to high market saturation, it is difficult to obtain jobs in such states. At the moment, the US economy seems to be getting better compared to the last few years, especially since the pandemic. S&P Global Market Intelligence now expects the US GDP growth forecast to be 2.4% in 2024 compared to its previous forecast of 1.7%. Economists at S&P Global Intelligence expect the US economy’s late 2023 growth momentum to continue into 2024. The boosting economy of the US is helping the job market as well. In January 2024, US employers added 353,000 new jobs, as per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over the last three months from November 2023 to January 2024, the US economy has added approximately 900,000 new jobs. Since March 2023, this is the fastest three-month period of job growth. Between November 2023 to January 2024, the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7%. In 2023, payroll employment surged by an average of 255,000 jobs per month. In January 2024, job growth was high in professional and business services, health care, retail trade, and social assistance. Each of the following segments added 74,000, 70,000, 45,000, and 30,000 jobs in January 2024, respectively. These numbers reflect the US economy’s resilience. In January 2024, the average hourly earnings on private nonfarm payrolls was almost $34.55. Whereas, the average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees was $29.66 in January. America’s job market is improving despite elevated interest rates maintained by the Fed. As we mentioned earlier, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell mentioned that the central bank will proceed carefully with interest rate cuts in 2024. Powell said the Fed wants to see more evidence that inflation is heading towards 2%. America is the land of opportunities and it has some of the most competitive job markets in the world across 50 states. Medical and Health Services Managers, Data Scientists, AI and Machine Learning Specialists, Software Developers, and Cloud System Engineers were some of the most needed jobs in America in 2023. Companies are prioritizing big data and generative AI in upgrading their offerings. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) are some of the leading American companies that provide top work opportunities. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) the giant e-commerce giant has created thousands of jobs across the US over the years. On February 6, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) updated that it is accepting grant applications from nonprofit literary organizations through Amazon Literary Partnership. The applicants can apply through April 15, 2024. Amazon Literary Partnership has aided more than $16 million in grant funding to empower writers by helping them learn, teach, create, publish, and experiment.PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the leading financial services companies in the US. The company has several technical and non-technical job openings in the US. On January 25, the company announced six innovations that it is bringing to the market in 2024. The company wants to revolutionize commerce via AI-driven personalization for both merchants and consumers. Such developments in AI will pave the way for experts in AI and Machine Learning. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the top computer software companies in the US. On January 16, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and the Adobe Foundation announced their first-ever Adobe Film & TV Fund. Adobe Inc.’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) fund will be granting $6 million to support underrepresented creators and filmmakers in finding career opportunities in the film and TV industry. Now, let’s take a look at the best states for job seekers right now.25 Best States for Job Seekers Right NowOur MethodologyTo compile or list the 25 best states for job seekers right now, we considered three metrics: Unemployment Rate, Labor Force Participation Rate, and Change in Nonfarm Employment by State, or Job Growth Rate. Firstly, we sorted the states based on the unemployment rate and gathered a list of 28 states with the lowest unemployment rates, as of December 2023. The unemployment rate measures the percentage of the labor force that is out of work.After forming the list of states with low unemployment rates, we ranked the states based on the year-over-year job growth rate, as of December 2023. The job growth rate shows the percentage change in employment between December 2022 and December 2023. The job growth rate potentially reflects the dynamism and expansion of the job market. The Labor Force Participation Rate represents the proportion of each state’s working-age population that is either looking for jobs or actively engaging in the labor market. The data for the Labor Force Participation Rate is also from December 2023.We have ranked the states in ascending order of their year-over-year job growth rate, primarily. We used the unemployment rate, our secondary metric, for tie-breaking. Finally, we used our tertiary metric, the labor force participation rate, for further tie-breaking if it was needed.The data for both the unemployment rate and job growth rate for the states is taken from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and the data for Labor Force Participation Rate is collected from the Federal Reserve Economic Data. We have also mentioned the annual average salary of each state and the data for that is taken from Forbes.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-stocks-invest-2024-200401023.html`2024-02-07 20:04:01`"In this article, we discuss 10 best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners. Global stocks reached their highest point in over two years, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record high on February 7, as per Reuters. This was driven by robust earnings, which helped counter concerns surrounding US regional banks and the Chinese markets. Bonds experienced slight pressure, as statements from Federal Reserve officials reinforced the expectation that the central bank might not reduce interest rates in the near future. According to Arthur Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth: ""We are at the midpoint of the 4Q earnings reporting season, and we would say that there has been more good news than bad.""In 2023, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 26.29%, recovering from the setback of 18.11% in 2022. In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts. The potential combination of declining interest rates and earnings growth is seen as a positive for stocks. However, analysts express worries about overvalued technology sector stocks, and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to introduce significant market volatility.Looking at historical data from 1921 to 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research, noted that the average S&P 500 bull market has yielded a return of 157% and lasted over four years. This historical pattern suggests the possibility of the stock market rally continuing in the foreseeable future. One notable success in the current bull market has been the performance of artificial intelligence technology as an investment theme. AI stocks were among the top performers in 2023, contributing to the market's overall positive trajectory. James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, commented: “The market’s recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI.” On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee suggests a more cautious outlook for 2024, anticipating an average year for markets rather than double-digit gains. Concerns include the S&P 500's elevated forward price/earnings ratio and a historically low equity risk premium. Valuations indicate potential sub-par annual stock returns, with estimates pointing to a 4% gain compared to the long-run average of 7%-8%. Analysts' optimistic projections for 2024 U.S. corporate earnings are questioned, with expectations of a tapering in economic growth from 7% to 4%. The market's assumption of a more aggressive Fed rate-cutting stance contrasts with public signals, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions as emergency programs wind down in 2024.Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, remarked: “As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.” Some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology For this list, we used a stock screener and selected stable companies with high single digit or low-teens revenue growth. Then, we arranged them via market cap to get the largest companies. We selected the top stocks for beginners based on revenue growth and hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter of 2023. The list is sorted in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders. Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Quarterly Revenue Growth: 14.10%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company in the United States with four segments – UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. UnitedHealthcare offers health benefit plans for employers and individuals, Medicaid plans, and children's health insurance.On January 12, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $6.16 and a revenue of $94.4 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.17 and $2.22 billion, respectively. Revenue for the period increased 14% on a year-over-year basis. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 104 hedge funds held stakes worth nearly $11 billion in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared to 111 funds in the prior quarter worth $10.1 billion. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.2 million shares worth $1.6 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best cheap stocks for beginners. Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) contributed less to portfolio performance than the majority of our holdings during the quarter. The Company reported double-digit revenue, operating earnings and earnings per share growth during their third quarter. The Company has been able to adjust pricing in its health care segment to keep up with medical cost inflation while working with its Optum units to deliver more value-based care that replaces the traditional fee for service health care model. Value-based care is a sensible, long-term growth opportunity for the Company to pursue and also differentiates it from the vast majority of healthcare providers, particularly as it relates to Medicare patients. For example, the Company’s value-based care programs provide more preventative care opportunities and home-based care visits for patients which helps save the U.S. healthcare system billions in unnecessary spending while also providing patients with better outcomes, as diseases and behaviors are caught or corrected at earlier stages. The Company has invested in several core assets over many years to execute this value-based strategy and it will become the standard of care as the proportion of people in the U.S. with healthcare insurance coverage continues to reach new highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.00%JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(NYSE:JPM), compared to 106 funds in the prior quarter.

After a 31% For Vote on executive compensation in 2022, the Board will not be granting any special awards to Jamie Dimon or Daniel Pinto and if awarded to other Named Executive Officers, there will be a direct performance condition associated with the award. The Compensation Committee limited the cash percentage of Dimon and Pinto’s compensation.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Quarterly Revenue Growth: 10.20%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, and other products for data centers, gaming, and embedded applications. It is one of the best cheap beginner stocks to invest in. On February 1, Citi analyst Christopher Danely observed that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, anticipating $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi suggested that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) may intentionally be underestimating, and the company's CEO expressed confidence in surpassing the $3.5 billion figure for this year.

(NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion. White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.60%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), a diversified software company, operates globally through three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising.

(NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.30%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a global provider of customer relationship management technology, facilitating the connection between companies and customers. The company's services include sales tools for data management, lead monitoring, progress tracking, and analytics.

Sills highlighted Salesforce's competitive advantage with a significant market share of only 15% and a robust moat derived from its extensive installed base of over 150,000 customers in the core sales/front office category.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 122 hedge funds were bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), same as the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with roughly 15 million shares worth $4 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) ranks 6th on our list of the top cheap stocks for beginners in 2024. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners.  Suggested articles:Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks15 Best Bitcoin Wallets For iPhone and Android11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes"`['AMD', 'ADBE', 'UNH', 'JPM', '^GSPC', 'CRM', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'MA']`
Adobe Inc. (ADBE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adobe-inc-adbe-attracting-investor-140011508.html`2024-02-07 14:00:11`Adobe Systems (ADBE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this software maker have returned +3.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.6% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Adobe belongs, has gained 10.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Adobe is expected to post earnings of $4.38 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $18.03 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.23 indicates a change of +12.2% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Adobe.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Adobe, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.08 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $21.42 billion and $23.91 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +11.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAdobe reported revenues of $5.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.6%. EPS of $4.27 for the same period compares with $3.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.82%. The EPS surprise was +3.39%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Adobe is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Adobe. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $1.31 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 17.36%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $257.33 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Silicon Labs shares have lost about 10.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.9%.What's Next for Silicon Labs?While Silicon Labs has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Silicon Labs: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

What Is Analog Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ADI) Share Price Doing?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-adi-110029221.html`2024-02-07 11:00:29`Let's talk about the popular Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The company is inching closer to its yearly highs following the recent share price climb. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Analog Devices’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices According to our valuation model, Analog Devices seems to be fairly priced at around 3.5% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Analog Devices today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $196.51, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Analog Devices’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Analog Devices, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 3.3%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ADI’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADI, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

Does Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-analog-devices-nasdaq-adi-110043409.html`2024-02-03 11:00:43`Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Impressively, Analog Devices has grown EPS by 27% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Analog Devices maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 2.5% to US$12b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Analog Devices.Since Analog Devices has a market capitalisation of US$95b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$338m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.4% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Analog Devices' strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Analog Devices' continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Analog Devices that you need to be mindful of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

3 Chip Stocks Set for Silicon Success in 2024`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-chip-stocks-set-silicon-110000113.html`2024-01-30 11:00:00`A few decades ago, the microchip industry seemed like a niche manufacturing sector. Most perceptions of microchips and semiconductors included large desktop computers and defense communications projects. Today, nearly everything needs a computer to work as the world becomes increasingly interconnected. Cars, watches, phones and even TVs all have some level of computing powering them.For the manufacturers of computers and their components, this means an endless stream of new orders and innovations to pursue. Though semiconductors rarely make popular headlines, the shift in political goals across East Asia has brought them into the spotlight. Rising tensions regarding the future of Taiwan and continuously strained supply lines have renewed commitments to returning manufacturing to the U.S.Furthermore, with increasing levels of development around the world, over five billion people rely on computers. Thanks to this global importance and investment in semiconductors, these are three 2024 chip stocks to keep an eye on.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: jejim / Shutterstock.comThough not the flashiest of names in the microchip industry, Analog Devices’ (NASDAQ:ADI) importance makes it worth knowing about. Critical to over 100,000 customers, from defense to commercial, ADI’s position in the market provides its stock stability.By offering a diverse lineup of products and continuously expanding through acquisitions, ADI has become a jack of all trades. Now, with ADI’s recent investment into a new Oregon-based factory, the company sits in a perfect position to expand profits. Despite being more costly, the benefits of domestic production cannot be overstated when considering ADI’s defense customers.As the need for military production supply lines ramps up, ADI’s new facility provides shorter lead times and greater security. It also allows Analog Devices to capitalize on federal grants intended to financially sweeten the deal. Take into consideration lagging production investments from competitors, and it makes sense why this stable stock sits at “moderate buy“.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices‘ (NASDAQ:AMD) stock soared over 145% in the past year, thanks to the introduction of training AI with graphics processing units (GPUs). This increase in demand catapulted AMD’s GPU sales, but the company continues to focus on its standard processors as well.By offering a spectrum of processors, AMD aims to serve every computer manufacturer’s needs. From low-performance, energy-efficient chips, to monstrously fast, high-speed processors, AMD has a product for every price point. This same philosophy extends to its GPU prices, with its prices consistently coming in below the competition’s.AMD’s push for a wider product portfolio also includes specializing its general processors for more dedicated tasks. Take for example the newly unveiled Radeon RX 7600 XT graphics card from AMD. Priced at only $350, the 7600 XT offers an affordable entry into the world of gaming and training AI. Innovations like this and a push towards providing accessible technology, make AMD a “strong buy” among 2024 chip stocks.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comFinally, when discussing chip stocks, it is impossible to not mention Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Though headquartered in Taiwan, its aggressive expansion in the U.S. comes as the demand for reliable electronics supply chains soars. Its new facility in Arizona and newly announced second facility in Japan generously expand production capacity.These expansions come while demand for semiconductors remains at an all-time high post-pandemic. Further concerns over potential conflicts between China and Taiwan also underscore the need for TSMC to increase production abroad. This provides Taiwan Semiconductor with the ability to fulfill backlogged orders and continue to operate, should any issues arise.New facilities also mean improved manufacturing equipment and efficiency, further improving TSMC’s position. Such investments in long-term capacity lead to 2024 chip stock stability for TSMC, while also increasing the potential for success. Low pricing along with significant upside potential maintains Taiwan Semiconductor as a “strong buy” this year.On the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Viktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.The #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard OfMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

Nextracker and Archer Daniels Midland have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextracker-archer-daniels-midland-highlighted-133200848.html`2024-02-09 13:32:00`"Chicago, IL – February 9, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Nextracker Inc NXT as the Bull of the Day and Archer Daniels Midland ADM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, CME Group Inc. CME and BlackRock, Inc. BLK.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stockNextracker Inc specializes in solar tracking solutions for solar power plants. Nextracker’s technology helps solar panels follow the sun’s movement throughout the day, optimizing their angle to maximize energy capture. By continuously adjusting the orientation of solar panels, Nextracker’s system ensures that panels receive the maximum amount of sunlight, increasing the overall efficiency and output of solar power plants. The company’s unique technology helps generate more electricity from solar energy, making it a key player in improving the performance and sustainability of solar energy projects.Over the past couple of years, the solar industry has been suffering from higher interest rates. Higher interest rates pose challenges for the solar industry due to increased financing costs. Solar projects require substantial upfront investments, and when interest rates rise, borrowing becomes more expensive. The elevated cost of capital can diminish the profitability of solar ventures and thus slow business in the industry to a standstill.During the California Gold Rush, some of the most successful ventures were companies such as Levi Strauss (LEVI) that didn’t mine for gold but instead supplied gold miners with the supplies they needed. The gold rush example is not a one-off – throughout history, parallel businesses have often benefited more dramatically than the underlying trend.The same is occurring with NXT. While most solar companies are seeing stagnant earnings, NXT’s unique product energized quarterly EPS by a robust 231% year-over-year. The results are even more impressive when you consider the current backdrop. Just ask yourself, “What will happen to NXT if interest rate cuts occur in 2024 like the market expects?”Gross margin is a financial metric representing the difference between a company’s revenue and the direct costs of producing goods or services, expressed as a percentage of revenue. NXT’s gross margin of 41.02% over the trailing twelve months is nearly double that of its sub-industry (33.24).How is NXT able to be so efficient?· Unique product: You can charge more when you have a unique product.Also, NXT’s business has fewer labor expenses when compared to normal solar companies.· Solves the efficiency problem: Though worldwide solar usage has increased dramatically in recent years, efficiency remains a significant obstacle for the space. Solar companies can now use Nextracker’s technology to help solar panels stay aligned with the sun for extended periods, optimizing energy production and making solar power more efficient and cost-effective.New Innovative, Fast-Growing Businesses Attract Institutional Investors2023 marked the weakest IPO market since 2016. In recent years, fewer IPOs have emerged stateside because private market capital raises are increasing (there is no need to go public in many cases), and the complexity and red tape involved in going public is more difficult than ever.While the lack of new issues is a net negative for investors, the trend is a positive for a company like NXT. Nextracker gives deep-pocketed institutional investors a means of gaining IPO exposure. Furthermore, unlike most recent IPOs, NXT’s business is far from saturated and is growing like a weed.Even before rates jumped, investors began to discount cuts in the future as stubborn inflation loomed. As a result, the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN), a proxy for the solar industry, cratered from a high of ~$126 in January 2021 to a low of $40 this week.However, you wouldn’t know that by looking at a comparison chart of NXT versus the solar industry. NXT shares are up a healthy 83% over the past year, while the Zacks Solar Industry is lower by 52%. If NXT can buck the trend in such a poor solar environment, the stock will likely explode should the solar industry turn around.Post-earnings drift refers to the tendency of a stock’s price to continue moving in the same direction as its initial price change following the release of the company’s earnings report.Last Thursday, NXT spiked ~25% on volume four times the average – remember, power and distance are correlated in the stock market.Nextracker stands out as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock specializing in solar tracking solutions for power plants. While the solar industry faces challenges from higher interest rates, Nextracker defies the trend with its unique technology, significantly boosting quarterly earnings.Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Archer Daniels Midland is a global food processing and commodities trading company that operates in various segments such as agriculture, nutrition, and transportation. The company is involved in sourcing, processing, and distributing agricultural products, including grains, oilseeds, and other raw materials. ADM’s diverse business encompasses food ingredients, animal feeds, biofuels, and industrial products.On January 22nd, shares of Archer Daniels Midland cratered nearly 25% after news broke that the US Attorney’s Office in Manhattan had launched an investigation into the accounting practices at Archer Daniels Midland’s nutrition segment.The CFO of the company has already been placed on leave and has preemptively lowered earnings guidance. Though the investigation is ongoing, the CFO leave news doesn’t pass the smell test. Furthermore, investors must ask themselves, “With thousands of stocks to invest in, why should I invest in a company under investigation for its accounting practices?”Seed oils, such as soybean oil, corn oil, and sunflower oil, have been criticized for several reasons regarding their adverse impact on health. These seed oils have an imbalance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids that can contribute to inflammation. Inflammation is linked to various chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, the plant-based protein (or meat alternative) craze appears to be nearing its end. ADM has seen persistently lower demand for its plant-based products. Beyond Meat,a pure play on the plant-based industry, is down by more than 64%, proving that this macro industry downtrend may have legs and may never recover.Competition is heating up in several of ADM’s main segments from companies like Swiss-based Bunge Globaland Cargill. As a result, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that ADM will suffer negative earnings and sales growth in 2024.On Wall Street, the only scoreboard that counts is price performance. Beyond ADM’s many fundamental issues, the company does not perform much better from this perspective. Over the past year, shares have lagged the S&P 500 Index’s 20.8% gain and lost 34.6%.For investors, few feelings are worse than investing in a chronically underperforming stock. Until ADM exhibits some semblance of a trend reversal, investors should avoid shares.The cryptocurrency market had a solid 2023 and the rally gathered further momentum in December, which led to a great beginning this year. On Jan 10, the crypto space witnessed a historic event as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in a major reform, approved the creation of 11 spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).The decision was widely expected and largely responsible for the December Bitcoin rally. Following the approval, Bitcoin prices soared further, rallying past $47,000. However, Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, has been on the decline since then.By the end of January, Bitcoin price had fallen sharply and was hovering around $39,000. However, some of the loss has been pared, and Bitcoin traded just above $43,000 on Feb 7.Nevertheless, Bitcoin still holds a lot of potential and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate cuts are likely to boost the cryptocurrency market. The Federal Reserve said that a rate cut in March is unlikely, but multiple rate cuts are happening this year for sure. Markets are pricing in at least three 25-basis point rate cuts in 2024.Lower interest rates generally have a positive influence on growth-oriented sectors, such as technology, consumer discretionary industries and cryptocurrencies.Also, the SEC’s latest decision is going to boost the crypto space in the long term as it will push cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance.Also, the next Bitcoin halving, projected in the first half of this year, is expected to reduce the mining reward for new blocks by half. This event historically enhances scarcity, posing a greater challenge for miners to acquire net Bitcoins and potentially leading to an increase in Bitcoin's value due to decreased supply.NVIDIA Corporation is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.NVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 268.3%.

15 Biggest Agriculture Stocks in 2024`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-agriculture-stocks-2024-203701833.html`2024-02-07 20:37:01`In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest agriculture stocks in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of the agriculture industry and what can be classified as an agriculture stock, then you can take a look at the 5 Biggest Agriculture Stocks in 2024. Despite having been replaced by industrialization, services, and now information technology, agriculture is nevertheless indispensable when it comes to maintaining and growing modern day societies. At the same time, since it's the one industry that has accompanied modern day civilization since its start, agriculture has also evolved with the ages. Now, companies that we can characterize as agriculture stocks no longer need to be involved either directly in the process of farming, in the process of storing food, or even in providing products such as pesticides and fertilizers to make a farmer's life easier.Instead, agriculture stocks such as the industrial behemoth Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) are manufacturing firms that make complex equipment capable of carrying out the tasks of hundreds of workers at a lower cost. Machines such as the ones made by Deere have transformed the way human beings have been able to grow, matching the impact by pureplay agriculture stocks such as Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. (NASDAQ:PACB) and Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA).In fact, technologies that agriculture stocks such as Pacific Biosciences rely on would be classified as nothing short of science fiction at the very least or even magic by farmers of previous centuries. PacBio sells systems that enable scientists and researchers to sequence the code of biological organisms. So, while farmers of 1900 would have to contend with seeing their crops die in the face of disease, today's farmers can rely on crops that have been genetically engineered to be resistant to the same attackers. Similarly, ranchers or cattle farmers can rely on livestock capable of meeting modern day production needs of both milk and meat.All these factors combined mean that agriculture stocks are quite lucrative. While they might not be as glitzy as high end artificial intelligence firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), agriculture stocks provide investors with the comfort of knowing that the demand for their products will continue as long as humans rely on biological food for sustenance. This makes the stocks attractive during periods of economic downturn, like their counterparts in the consumer defensive stock sector.At the same time, agriculture stocks are nevertheless vulnerable to the same market weaknesses as other stocks. Like broader commodity prices, agriculture stocks also rely on global supply chain stability to act as the backbone of their valuation. For instance, companies like Corteva that sell seeds might have a large portion of their customers located in an international country. If the shipping lines to that country are threatened, or if domestic conditions make spending money difficult for locals, then Corteva might see its investors become worried - causing the share price to drop.Broadly speaking, we can break down agriculture stocks into several categories depending on the supply chain. At the backend of the chain, or upstream as analysts would like to call it, are seed, fertilizer, and medicine companies such as Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), Corteva, and the well known Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (OTC:BAYRY). Then, after the farmers have grown the crops, firms such as Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) pop in and buy their products to act as a middle party between the farmer and the market. Agriculture stocks such as Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) procure products such as potatoes and sell them in the form of finished products such as fries further down the supply chain. From here on, agriculture stocks see the end of the road as retailers like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) deliver the product in the consumer's hands.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest agriculture stocks as we head into 2024. Some of the biggest agriculture stocks are Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), Corteva, Inc.

Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) Second-Quarter Results Just Came Out: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting For This Year`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/automatic-data-processing-inc-nasdaq-122105302.html`2024-02-02 12:21:05`Investors in Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) had a good week, as its shares rose 4.7% to close at US$247 following the release of its second-quarter results. Automatic Data Processing reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$4.7b and statutory earnings per share of US$2.13, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Automatic Data Processing from 17 analysts is for revenues of US$19.1b in 2024. If met, it would imply an okay 3.0% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to accumulate 5.4% to US$9.13. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$19.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.12 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$253. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Automatic Data Processing, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$280 and the most bearish at US$227 per share. This is a very narrow spread of estimates, implying either that Automatic Data Processing is an easy company to value, or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions.Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Automatic Data Processing'shistorical trends, as the 6.1% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 6.1% annual growth over the past five years. Juxtapose this against our data, which suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 6.4% per year. It's clear that while Automatic Data Processing's revenue growth is expected to continue on its current trajectory, it's only expected to grow in line with the industry itself.The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$253, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

Automatic Data Processing, Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).Operator: Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Danny Hussain: Thank you, Michelle, and welcome, everyone, to ADP's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO, and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release.Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria.Maria Black: Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. This morning, we reported strong second quarter results, including 6% revenue growth and 9% adjusted EPS growth. I'll begin with a review of the quarter's financial highlights, before providing an update on the progress we are making across our strategic priorities. We delivered solid Employer Services new business bookings in the second quarter, reaching a new record bookings volume for Q2, and keeping us on track for our full-year outlook. Growth was especially robust across our small business portfolio, and we also experience healthy growth in our mid-market and international business. With steady demand in HCM and a healthy new business pipeline at the end of the quarter, we look forward to the important selling season ahead.Employer Services retention was strong in the second quarter. Although it declined slightly compared to the prior year, we once again exceeded our expectations as we continue to benefit from a healthy overall business environment, and from our very high client satisfaction levels. Our Employer Services pays per control growth remained at 2% for the second quarter. The overall labor market remains resilient, and our clients continue to add employees at a moderate pace, which is resulting in a very gradual deceleration and pays per control growth. And last, our PEO revenue growth of 3% for the second quarter, was in line with our expectations, and we are very pleased to have delivered strong PEO new business bookings that were ahead of our expectations.Based on continued healthy activity levels, we feel good about our PEO bookings momentum, and we look forward to seeing a gradual re-acceleration of our PEO business in the second half of this fiscal year. Moving on to a broader update. During the second quarter, we launched a new brand advertising campaign themed, the next anything. The campaign highlights how the world of work is always changing, sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly, and trusted business solutions must evolve with it. The theme aligns with our strategic priorities to give our clients the advantage of our leading technology, expertise, and scale. In Q2, we continue to push forward on our first strategic priority to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. A key part of that is the rollout of ADP Assist, our cross-platform solution powered by GenAI that proactively delivers actionable insights in plain language to enhance HR productivity, aid decision-making, and streamline day-to-day tasks for our clients and their employees.ADP Assist seamlessly integrates with ADP products across multiple platforms. Using an intuitive conversational interface, it provides valuable and contextual insights which touch every aspect of HR. For example, in addition to the features we shared with you last quarter, including our natural language reporting capability, in Q2, we integrated natural language search capabilities into our run platform, which allows it to understand intent behind the search terms and use GenAI to mine ADP's deep knowledge base to deliver easy to use and effective content. ADP Assist also helps clients validate payrolls and solve common employee challenges across HR, payroll, time, and benefits. It's a comprehensive experience that is trained on the industry's largest and deepest HCM dataset and our deep knowledge base to surface highly credible and actionable insights so that clients can make smarter decisions.We are excited about the roadmap ahead for all of our major solutions, and we expect it to help us build on the recognition we continue to earn in the market. In Q2 alone, we were pleased to be recognized for product leadership by three major industry analyst rankings. Everest Group named ADP the highest leader out of 27 providers in its multi-country payroll solutions PEAK Matrix report. NelsonHall identified ADP as a leader in its Payroll Services Vendor Evaluation and Assessment tool in all markets. And Ventana Research named us an exemplary leader across its North American, global, and payroll management buyers guide for performing the best and meeting overall product and customer experience requirements. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing solutions.We shared last quarter that we were beginning to equip our associates with GenAI capabilities through our Agent Assist technology. In Q2, we expanded our call summarization deployment to a greater portion of our service associates and started to see productivity gains with shorter handle time and improved service quality. With our global service associates fielding millions of calls annually, we are incredibly excited to test ways to optimize those client interactions. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale, and we continue to lean into this advantage. In Q2, we announced a strategic collaboration with Convera, a global business to business payments company to help our multi-country clients manage the complexity of global payroll and cross-border payments through an integrated platform.By combining Convera’s payment solutions with our global payroll expertise, we're enhancing the client experience by minimizing the need to access various banking platforms and improving payment accuracy, compliance, and security. We also announced the launch of ADP retirement trust services to support our growing retirement services business. Standing up our own trust services entity demonstrates our scale and commitment to our retirement clients, positioning us on par with financial industry leaders and ahead of HCM competitors that rely on third parties. This commitment can really matter to financial advisors, keeps data within ADP's trusted ecosystem, and provides a cost and price benefit to ADP and our clients over the long term. Our scale also affords us the opportunity to partner with other leading technology providers in innovative ways, and we continue to expand on many of those partnerships to provide our sales implementation and service teams with client-specific insights to quickly address market shifts, drive more personalized interactions, and deepen our overall client engagement.Overall, our second quarter represented strong outcomes on the financial front and with respect to our key strategic priorities. I'd like to thank our associates who continue to deliver exceptional products and outstanding service to our clients, particularly now, as many of them are in the middle of our most hectic time of year completing year-end work. I'm proud to share that their efforts help drive our overall Net Promoter Score to its highest level ever in the second quarter. Thank you again for all that you do for ADP and for our clients. And now, I'll turn it over to Don.Don McGuire: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide more color on our results for the quarter, as well as our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Overall, we reported a strong second quarter, with our consolidated revenue growth moderating in line with our expectations, and our adjusted EBIT margin coming in slightly better than expected. However, the interest rate backdrop has changed since we last provided our full-year outlook, and we are lightly tweaking our outlook, which I'll detail. I'll start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 8% on a reported basis, and 7% on an organic constant currency basis, coming in slightly ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, we continue to grow our ES new business bookings, resulting in a record second quarter bookings volume.Our small business portfolio and international business provided outsized growth contributions this quarter. And with a steady HCM demand environment and healthy pipelines, we feel on track for our 4% to 7% new business bookings growth outlook for the year. As mentioned earlier, our ES retention declined slightly in Q2 versus the prior year, but again exceeded our expectations. Given our first half retention outperformance, we are increasing our full-year retention outlook slightly. We now anticipate a 40 to 60 basis point decline in our full-year retention, which is 10 basis points better than our prior forecast. ES pays per control growth of 2% in Q2, was in line with our expectations, and we are maintaining our 1% to 2% growth outlook for the full-year.And client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectations in Q2, as a slight decline in our average client funds balance, which we discussed last quarter, was more than offset by an increase in our average yield. However, we are revising our full-year client funds interest outlook lower to reflect the change in prevailing interest rates since our last update. We now expect fiscal 2024 client funds interest revenue of $985 million to $995 million, and we expect a net impact from our client funds extended investment strategy of $835 million to $845 million, representing a reduction of about $20 million at the midpoint. In total, there is no change to our fiscal 2024 ES revenue growth forecast of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 170 basis points in Q2, driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue growth, but reflecting the impact of a reduced client funds interest revenue forecast, as well as a slight increase in expected GenAI related spend, we are tweaking our fiscal 2024 ES margin outlook and now anticipate the lower end of our prior margin range.Moving on to the PEO, we had 3% revenue growth, driven by 2% growth in average work site employees in the second quarter. These metrics were in line with expectation, and we are encouraged to see signs of stabilization in our PEO pays per control growth. As Maria mentioned, our PEO new business bookings were very strong in Q2. With continued healthy activity levels, we continue to anticipate a gradual ramp in our work site employee growth in the back half of fiscal 2024, and we are maintaining our full-year growth outlook of 2% to 3%. PEO margin decreased 50 basis points in Q2. As we shared last quarter, we assume this year's workers' compensation reserve release benefit will be lower than last year's benefit, and we are further narrowing our PEO margin expectation to be down 80 to 100 basis points in fiscal 2024 versus our prior expectation of decline of 50 to 100 basis points.Putting it all together, there is no change to our fiscal 2024 consolidated revenue growth outlook of 6% to 7%. With the two changes to segment margin, we now expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 60 to 70 basis points versus our prior outlook, for an increase of 60 to 80 basis points. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of around 23%, and we still anticipate fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%, with the middle of that range the most likely outcome given current assumptions.

For example, nearly 100,000 new affordable homes need to be built every day to house an estimated 3 billion people by 2030. Additionally, the industry faces pressure to improve its sustainability; construction is one of the most wasteful industries in the world and it's responsible for nearly 40% of global CO2 emissions.""The way the AECO industry works today is not sustainable or scalable. For the industry to keep pace, it needs to build more, faster and more sustainably. The answer is industrialized construction,"" said Ryan McMahon, director and general manager, Informed Design at Autodesk. ""Autodesk Informed Design connects design and make from day one and brings industrialized construction workflows to reality. Our solution is unique because it empowers architects to design with certainty and validate their plans in real-time, while product managers and engineers can share accurate manufacturing information with design teams. As a result, projects are completed quicker, with higher quality and generate less waste.""Informed Design is part of Autodesk's Design and Make Platform environment, which includes cloud-connected software solutions that unite teams, data and workflows across entire project lifecycles to deliver better, faster outcomes. With Informed Design, Autodesk is ushering the AECO industry towards an industrialized setup that embeds sustainability throughout.

PIX is a production management solution for secure review and content collaboration between creatives and executives in the media and entertainment industry throughout the production process.Autodesk's 2023 State of Design and Make report found that media and entertainment companies cite operational efficiency and value creation as key business drivers. Once the transaction closes, the PIX acquisition would strongly deliver on both of these customer-driven outcomes by fostering broader collaboration and communication, as well as driving greater efficiencies in the production process to save customers time and money. The acquisition would also support Autodesk's vision to fully realize the potential of connecting pre- and post-production data for our customers through Flow, the Media & Entertainment industry cloud on Autodesk's Design and Make platform.This potential transaction is subject to regulatory approval. Terms of the deal will not be disclosed.Autodesk's proposed acquisition of PIX has not been completed; the completion of the proposed acquisition of PIX is uncertain and is subject to regulatory approval and the satisfaction of various other closing conditions. Until close, Autodesk and PIX will remain separate companies. Subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing closing conditions, the proposed acquisition of PIX is expected to close early in fiscal year 2025.The foregoing descriptions of the contemplated effects of the proposed acquisition are subject to the acquisition's completion and Autodesk's ability to successfully integrate PIX in all respects.This communication includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws regarding future events and development efforts for our products and services, including without limitation statements regarding the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and the anticipated timing of the acquisition.

3 Cheap Industrial Stocks Primed to Ride an Infrastructure Boom`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-cheap-industrial-stocks-primed-225132753.html`2024-01-22 22:51:32`We’ve all seen the headlines – America’s infrastructure is falling apart, bridges are crumbling, and major roads are chock full of potholes. The government knows infrastructure has been neglected for decades. That’s why, back in 2021, legislators passed massive spending bills totaling around $3 trillion targeted mostly at infrastructure modernization projects.Now, almost three years later, that infrastructure boom has arrived. Those federal dollars are just starting to flow into roads, bridges, airports, broadband internet, the electrical grid, and more. There’s much more cash to come over the next decade, too. I believe we’re only witnessing the start of a massive, decade-long infrastructure boom.Accordingly, I think it’s a smart play to get into industrial and materials stocks tied to infrastructure before the boom really takes off. These companies will see surging demand, juicy government contracts, strong earnings, and rising stock prices. And the best part? Many infrastructure-related stocks are still cheap, despite the sector’s bright prospects. Let’s take a look at some of the best options in the market right now!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAs one of the largest steel producers in North America, Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) stands to benefit enormously from the coming infrastructure boom. After its unsuccessful $35 per share bid for U.S. Steel, some investors grew skeptical about Cleveland-Cliffs’ growth prospects. But I believe the selloff is overdone. Cleveland-Cliffs remains a bargain buy, given the expected surge in infrastructure spending over the next decade.Missing out on U.S. Steel was a blow in the battle to consolidate the American steel industry. However, Cleveland-Cliffs already completed its pivotal acquisition of AK Steel in 2020, establishing its firm foothold as a major supplier of infrastructure materials. Compared to steel peers, Cleveland-Cliffs boasts industry-leading profitability metrics. Current valuations around 10-times forward earnings dramatically undervalue Cleveland-Cliffs’ earnings growth potential, if infrastructure tailwinds gather steam.Infrastructure legislation promises more than $1 trillion in new public works projects over the next decade. As shovel-ready construction unfolds, demand for steel products will accelerate rapidly. And while steel prices have settled back to pre-pandemic norms, resurgent economic expansion could easily ignite the next supercycle. If so, Cleveland-Cliffs’ depressed share price presents a compelling value opportunity for investors betting on an infrastructure boom.Source: ShutterstockBlending cutting-edge AI technology with cloud computing and advanced sensors, Iteris (NASDAQ:ITI) delivers smart mobility infrastructure solutions to improve transportation efficiency. This company stands ready to capitalize on the infrastructure spending wave as roads, vehicles, and cities grow increasingly connected.Recent earnings results validate Iteris’s leading position at this lucrative intersection of technology and infrastructure. In Q3 2023, Iteris’ total revenue jumped 11% year-over-year, exceeding analyst targets. For the full year 2023, analysts forecast an impressive 32% earnings per share surge on continued double-digit revenue expansion. Yet, despite eye-popping growth metrics, ITI stock still trades at a mere 18-times forward earnings. That’s remarkably cheap for a tech stock executing so well.As governments earmark billions to upgrade transportation networks, demand appears rock-solid for Iteris’ AI-powered mobility infrastructure solutions. Its ClearMobility platform visualizes traffic patterns to optimize mobility infrastructure planning and maintenance. Expansive product offerings (like advanced video and radar sensors to monitor intersections of every size) position Iteris well to capture a sizable share of this high-growth market. At 1.15-times forward sales compared to +10% revenue growth, ITI’s modest valuations seem disconnected from the company’s fundamentals.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAnother software maker benefiting from the infrastructure boom, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) has its staked its claim in design and engineering in industries like architecture, construction, and manufacturing. Autodesk helps professionals design and create anything imaginable through its digital design platforms. And with infrastructure spending set to balloon over the coming decade, demand seems certain to accelerate for Autodesk’s large-scale project solutions.After trading range-bound near $200 per share for most of 2022 and 2023, ADSK stock has staged an impressive breakout over recent months. Since November, shares are up nearly 26%, outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq benchmark. And with momentum building ahead of swelling infrastructure tailwinds, I believe ADSK stock looks poised to continue steep gains.At almost 10-times forward sales, Autodesk hardly looks like a bargain on the surface. However, the company’s current valuation looks plenty reasonable for a software business reinvesting heavily to stimulate growth in massive addressable markets. Consensus forecasts call for Autodesk’s sales to double by 2032 as infrastructure and construction activity scales dramatically higher. And profits should follow suit, expected to nearly double over the next eight years.Applying the same price-to-earnings multiple on future earnings, ADSK’s share price would double if growth materializes as projected. Considering Autodesk’s track record of surpassing estimates year after year, the company’s risk/reward profile appears to be tilted firmly to the upside.Software companies usually trade at a premium, but Autodesk checks all the right boxes for me. Trading at 33-times next year’s earnings barely reflects Autodesk’s long runway for above-market growth as infrastructure spending ramps into overdrive.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

17 Best Augmented Reality Stocks To Invest In`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/17-best-augmented-reality-stocks-104426829.html`2024-01-21 10:44:26`"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 17 Best Augmented Reality Stocks To Invest In. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Augmented Reality Stocks To Invest In.Just a few years back analysts were calling augmented reality the next big thing and AR startups were attracting huge investments. But now the sole focus of VCs and investment firms remains AI and AR seems to have taken a back seat. Does that mean the AR and VR revolution everyone was talking about ended before even starting? Experts don't think so. In fact they believe the rise of generative AI has opened up new horizons for augmented reality technologies. A report by NSFlow said that integration of AI and augmented reality will help companies produce realistic digital worlds, characters and artwork.The report said AI will be used in multi-sensory technologies, including haptic gloves and devices that create immersive experiences. More and more companies are now seeing the potential the combo of AI and AR could unlock. In June 2023, Meta Platforms announced that its Reality Labs would be pursuing augmented reality and immersive reality technologies. And in December 2023 the company said its Ray Ban smart glasses showed how people would use AI and AR in immersive reality products in the future.Apple's blockbuster spatial computing headset Vision Pro is also a manifestation of the killer AI+VR combo. The device combines AI and VR to develop a spatial operating system and a 3D user interface to give a realistic experience to its user.A technician wearing a head-mounted augmented reality headset examining a MEMS device.MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds and picked 17 augmented reality companies with the highest number of hedge funds. We preferred companies which make actual AR-related hardware and software products or develop technologies that are used by other companies in the development of augmented reality products. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicatorNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 3 Rochester, New York-based Vuzix makes wearable VR and AR wearable display technology. In November, Vuzix Corp (NASDAQ:VUZI) announced that it entered into a partnership with  Quanta Computer to support the manufacturing of next generation lightweight smart glasses for broader markets. VUZI ranks 17th in our list of the best augmented reality (AR) stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Vuzix Corp (NASDAQ:VUZI) shares have not been performing well, having lost about 60% over the past 12 months. That’s why hedge funds are ejecting the stock from their portfolios since just three hedge funds reported owning stakes in Vuzix Corp (NASDAQ:VUZI) at the end of the third quarter of 2023, down from seven funds in the previous quarter.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 6MicroVision Inc (NASDAQ:MVIS) makes lidar sensing technologies primarily used in automotive safety systems. MicroVision Inc's (NASDAQ:MVIS) lidar technologies play a key role in the AR world since they allow AR and VR systems to perceive surroundings and refine immersive experience. MicroVision Inc's (NASDAQ:MVIS) patents related to lidar are important in the AR industry and could help the stock significantly in the future.In 2020, MicroVision Inc (NASDAQ:MVIS) shared in a video its AR micro-display module technology which uses its existing Gen3 MEMS.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 12Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) develops and licenses touch feedback technology, which is of significant importance in the augmented reality and virtual reality industry. As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 12 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR). IMMR ranks 15th in our list of the best augmented reality (AR) stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) has a PE ratio of 5.8 and a dividend yield of about 2.6% as of January 15. In December 2023 Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) upped its dividend by 50%.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 20Battery technology company Enovix Corp (NASDAQ:ENVX) makes it to our list of the best AR stocks hedge funds are buying as Enovix Corp (NASDAQ:ENVX) makes batteries for AR, VR and IoT devices.In 2021 Enovix Corp (NASDAQ:ENVX) said it started making a new cell design for Augmented Reality (AR) glasses for a top-tier consumer electronics company.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 25Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) is one of the most important companies in the augmented reality space, providing both software and hardware tools and suite for the development of AR and VR-related apps. Snap Inc's (NYSE:SNAP) Lens Studio for AR apps development is highly popular among developers.In December, Guggenheim increased its rating on Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) shares to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $23 from $9. The analyst firm is bullish on the stock amid its expectation of a rebound in ad spending in 2024.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 25 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) was Karthik Sarma's SRS Investment Management which owns a $469 million stake in Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP).Artisan Developing World Fund stated the following regarding Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included social media platform Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP). Snap benefited from signs of improved industry demand, improved customer adoption of Snap’s direct response technology platform, and a new partnership with Amazon.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 27With AR Foundation, Unity MARS, XR Interaction toolkit and many other software and tools for AR games and apps, Unity Software Inc (NYSE:U) is a notable name in the AR and VR industry. Unity Software Inc's (NYSE:U) tools are used by millions of developers for the development of AR and VR apps.Earlier this month Citi Thematic Equity Strategy published a list of stocks expected to gain value in 2024 based on specific themes. Unity Software Inc (NYSE:U) made it to the list on the back of ""digital leisure"" theme.In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U):“We also sold Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U), a select growth name purchased in early 2022 to participate in the growth of the global video game market, as our thesis no longer remains valid. Via M&A, Unity has diversified away from its game engine subscription business into the less differentiated advertising segment and most recently saw negative customer reaction to price increases, calling into question the offering’s pricing power.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 21One of the most important pieces of hardware technologies in the AR and VR industry is OLED microdisplays. The quality of immersive experiences in AR and VR apps depends upon the quality of OLED microdisplays. Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is one of the leaders in this space as Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) Semiconductor Solutions Corporation(SSS) make AR headsets and OLED microdisplays that are used in gaming, entertainment and business use. The stock ranks 11th in our list of the best augmented reality (AR) stocks to buy according to hedge funds.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 21 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 34Metaverse, VR and AR are often seen as abstract and speculative ideas. But if one were to point to a place where metaverse is actually in action, it would be Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX). Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX) allows people to develop their own virtual worlds and play inside them. Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX) allows developers to make AR- and VR-related apps for virtual worlds. Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX) last year started launching new AI-based tools that would help people who don’t have coding knowledge develop games and virtual worlds.Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX) talked about AI during its Q3 earnings call:""We’ve highlighted we’ve got 70 ML pipelines running right now inside the company that goes all the way from our safety systems, moderation systems, real-time translation systems, gets into our search and discovery systems, and then gets into more of the user-facing things, like Roblox Assistant. I think the big takeaway is, we want to run super high volume inference, for example, voice, as much as possible on our own hardware so we can do this extremely efficiently. And I would highlight on our edge data centers using as much as possible the same hardware to run inference. It gives us the ability in parts of the world that are not as active to use that for inference.As far as the collection of tools we’re using, I would say generally yes, yes, yes, open source. The market is in a really interesting time as far as what people are building and training and tuning and distilling and optimizing internally. And we’re building a full AI internal platform that many of our teams will then use for high performance inference.""Read the entire earnings call transcript here.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 38Industrial AR technology company PTC Inc (NASDAQ:PTC) ranks 9th in our list of the best augmented reality (AR) stocks to buy now. PTC Inc (NASDAQ:PTC) also owns Vuforia, an enterprise AR platform.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 51Autodesk Inc (NASDAQ:ADSK) offers a plethora of software tools, platforms and plugins that help companies and developers in making AR-related products and apps. Some notable AR offerings of Autodesk Inc (NASDAQ:ADSK) include Fusion, a cloud-based 3D CAD/CAM/CAE software for product design; VRED, a 3D virtual prototyping software for automotive design, and many other such tools.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK): Autodesk was our next top detractor despite quarterly results reported in late May that were in line with expectations. For 1Q, revenue grew 12%, Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO) grew 15%, and the company generated $714 million of FCF, which increased 69% year over year. Profitability for the company was strong, with a 32% non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter, and management reiterated its outlook for the year.Autodesk has a near monopoly on software for designing, building, and managing buildings, as well as software for infrastructure and manufacturing plants, prototyping software for manufacturers of products (including autos, machinery, and consumer products) and document sharing. As a result, we believe ADSK’s business is very sticky. The company expects to grow revenue mid-teens annually over the next several years, and, as we have seen in similar SaaS businesses, as revenue scales, operating margins are expected to expand significantly from their current 32% to more than 40%, more in-line with peers. We believe that ADSK shares can grow along with its mid-teens free cash flow growth over the next several years.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 53Texas Instruments plays a key role in the development of AR-related hardware. The company's circuits and reference designs help companies develop lightweight, reliable systems for augmented reality (AR) glasses.Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Shares of semiconductor manufacturing company Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) underperformed as revenue guidance was slightly below market expectations. We believe these demand trends to be transitory and have a favorable view of the company’s long-term prospects and superior competitive position.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 67QUALCOMM Inc's (NASDAQ:QCOM) semiconductor technologies are powering many key AR and VR devices in the world. QUALCOMM Inc's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon® augmented reality technology powers extended reality, AR, VR and immersive reality experiences. The stock ranks 6th in our list of the best augmented reality (AR) stocks to buy according to hedge funds.QUALCOMM Inc's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon XR1 AR Smart Viewer is a type of AR glasses that overlay digital information into your field of visionIn its third quarter 2023 investor letter, Bonsai Partners stated the following regarding QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM):“Robustness at the product level exists differently than in other layers of the value chain. Product diversification follows the same principle, but product control isn’t related to vertical integration. Product control exists in multiple forms, such as switching costs or happy customers who don’t want to buy elsewhere. However, one often overlooked dimension of product-level robustness is adaptability. Some businesses offer goods and services that behave like shapeshifters; they naturally adapt to the market’s needs regardless of how the world changes. Adaptability also serves as a hedge against the unknown.Consider our investment in Taiwan Semiconductor, which enjoys a highly adaptive product portfolio. If we compare TSMC to a fabless chip maker like QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), investing in Qualcomm is a bet that its products will retain their technological advantage over time. Meanwhile, TSMC sells a service that naturally produces whatever the end customer wants. There is little need for brilliant product-level foresight; TSMC just needs to maintain its process and service level advantages, allowing it to manufacture whatever the market demands. TSMC’s product portfolio is robust compared to most other semiconductor companies because it naturally adapts to technological and market-driven shifts. Instead of product-level risk, TSMC’s core risks are geopolitical.In the past, I would have been more drawn to a company like Qualcomm given its clear technological lead in baseband modems, but if I’m honest with myself, I don’t know if their technologies will retain their dominance ten years from now. Qualcomm’s products express a relatively high degree of rigidity in a fast-changing industry, and this is something I prefer to avoid.While robustness isn’t a guarantee of company survival, it acts as a natural buffer that insulates the companies we invest in against the unknown. The better we are at identifying robustness for our portfolio, the longer we also will endure.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Augmented Reality Stocks To Invest In. Suggested Articles:11 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Hedge Funds10 AI Stocks Billionaires Are Crazy AboutJim Cramer’s 10 Best AI StocksDisclosure. None. 17 Best Augmented Reality Stocks To Invest In was initially published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes"`['SNAP', 'QCOM', 'VUZI', 'ADSK', 'U', 'TXN', 'ALIMR.PA', 'MVIS', 'RBLX']`

Can Southern (SO) Q4 Earnings Maintain Its Beat Streak?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-q4-earnings-maintain-beat-141200203.html`2024-02-09 14:12:00`The Southern Company SO is set to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 15. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 59 cents per share on revenues of $7.7 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the power supplier’s performance in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Southern Company’s previous-quarter results first.In the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider beat the consensus mark on lower-than-expected operating expenses, to go with the positive effects of  weather, rates, usage and pricing changes. Southern Company had reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.42, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32. However, revenues of $7 billion came in 16.7% below the consensus mark, affected by a drop in industrial sales.SO topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. The utility has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.5%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Southern Company (The) price-eps-surprise | Southern Company (The) Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 126.9% improvement year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 9.8% increase from the year-ago period. Southern Company's seven major regulated utilities serve approximately nine million electric and natural gas customers. Leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, the firm has been successfully expanding its regulated business customer base. As proof of that effort, Southern Company added more than 35,000 new residential electric customers and in excess of 19,000 residential natural gas customers in the first three quarters of 2023. This trend most likely continued in the October-December period of 2023 because of healthy economic development across its service territories.On a further bullish note, the power supplier’s operations and maintenance cost in the fourth quarter might have come down due to prudent management. This, in turn, is likely to have buoyed overall earnings. In particular, our estimate for operations and maintenance outgo is pegged at $1.5 billion, indicating a 25.9% drop from $2 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Southern Company this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.SO has an Earnings ESP of +2.95% and a Zacks Rank #2.Southern Company is not the only company in the utilities space looking up this earnings cycle. Here are some other firms from the space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:Sempra Energy SRE has an Earnings ESP of +1.18% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Why Ameren (AEE) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ameren-aee-poised-beat-171011230.html`2024-02-06 17:10:11`Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Ameren (AEE), which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This utility has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9.64%.For the most recent quarter, Ameren was expected to post earnings of $1.80 per share, but it reported $1.87 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.89%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.78 per share, while it actually produced $0.90 per share, a surprise of 15.38%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Ameren lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Ameren has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 22, 2024.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Ameren Corporation (NYSE:AEE)`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-ameren-corporation-135356871.html`2024-01-17 13:53:56`Using the Dividend Discount Model, Ameren fair value estimate is US$71.97Ameren's US$71.21 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate The US$77.00 analyst price target for AEE is 7.0% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Ameren Corporation (NYSE:AEE) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Ameren We have to calculate the value of Ameren slightly differently to other stocks because it is a integrated utilities company. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Relative to the current share price of US$71.2, the company appears about fair value at a 1.1% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$2.9 / (6.2% – 2.2%)= US$72.0We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ameren as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.StrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Ameren, we've put together three important elements you should further research:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Ameren   (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) you should know about.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for AEE's future outlook?

At US$16.50, Is The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) Worth Looking At Closely?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-16-50-aes-corporation-125612679.html`2024-01-25 12:56:12`Let's talk about the popular The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES). The company's shares led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine AES’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for AES According to our valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 39%, trading at US$16.50 compared to our intrinsic value of $11.91. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since AES’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With revenues expected to grow by a double-digit 12% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for AES. If the level of expenses is able to be maintained, it looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Are you a shareholder? AES’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe AES should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AES for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for AES, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for AES you should know about.If you are no longer interested in AES, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

11 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-stocks-rich-5-10-120121544.html`2024-01-21 12:01:21`"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 11 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years.Can investing in stocks make you rich? This question is rarely posed anymore since data has overwhelmingly proved that investing in the stock markets is one of the best ways to increase your wealth over time. A report in October 2023 by the Wall Street Journal talked about the rise of ""mini-millionaires"" and how the average wealth of American families was increasing, citing data from the Federal Reserve. Mini-millionaires usually make about $150,000 and $250,000 a year. The report said between 2019 and 2022 families in the 80th to 90th percentile of the income distribution saw the biggest rise in their incomes as their median wealth increased by about 69% from 2019 through 2022, adjusted for inflation.The report said that over 90% of these families reported owning stocks, either directly or indirectly.Needless to say, investing in the stock market is full of crevices. You can't expect to get rich investing in low-quality stocks and random companies with no value. Investing in stocks to become rich involves patience, wise choices and sticking to traditional investing principles. Legendary value investor Seth Klarman had in 2000 foreseen the changing trends in the stock market where investors were becoming impatient, expecting to make money without paying attention to the actual fundamentals of companies. But Klarman at the time had also predicted the return of traditional methods of evaluating companies before investing. In his letter to investors Klarman had said:""If Paul Harvey's serialized radio program ""The Rest of the Story"" were applied to Wall Street, it would describe the sad denouement of many such ""story"" stocks. The unraveling of the virtuous circle of growth is not pretty, with earnings shortfalls, plunging share prices, employees with under-water options jumping ship, overzealous shareholders receiving margin calls, accounting chicanery exposed, lawsuits filed, and, to come full circle, the final insult of deletion from the relevant major market index. At this time, attractive valuation is not considered a good story. A slow growth or no growth company trading at one half or one third of its underlying value attracts no important constituency of investors. I sometimes joke about the new market valuation rules of thumb: stocks that fail to meet earnings expectations all seem to trade at 10 times reduced earnings, while formerly profitable companies that report losses all seem to trade at five dollars per share. Many investors avoid these stocks precisely because others are staying away. Why would those kind of stocks ever go up, they wonder. Even those of us with value investing in our DNA generally prefer situations with catalysts for the realization of underlying value.Over time, this will change. At some unknowable future point, the undervaluation of small capitalization stocks lacking exciting growth characteristics will become so gaping that investors will once again be attracted. The point of investing, after all, is not to have a great story to tell; the point of investing is to make money with limited risk. At some point, investors will drop their Pulitzer prize winning story stocks and revisit their attention on the old classics, stocks that make you money because their undervaluation creates a compelling imbalance between risk and return.""Seth Klarman of Baupost GroupMethodologyFor this article we scoured various analyst reports and interviews to pick 11 stocks that experts believe can make one rich in the next 5-10 years.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 16ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT) is one of the stocks that can make one rich in the next few years according to Wall Street analysts. Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch last year set a $27 price target on the stock. ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT) was trading at $2.11 as of January 4. Here is why the analyst likes the stock:“Of note, in our view, is that the company’s substantial product development cycle is slowing and management continues to expect material operating leverage as R&D spend moderates. Second, demand continues to be robust as EV sales grow in multiple geographies driving charging infrastructure buildout. Third, the company is well capitalized as it drives toward positive adjusted EBITDA in F2Y4 and manages working capital needs for growth. We remain constructive on shares as we anticipate the company will enjoy both top-line growth and margin expansion in coming quarters.”In addition to CHPT, investors are also piling into high quality names like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 20Biopharma company Tarsus Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:TARS) ranks 10th in our list of the stocks that will make you rich in the next five to ten years. The average price target for the stock over the next one year is $43.25.Oppenheimer analyst Francois Brisebois, who also has a $43 price target on the stock, explained his bullish thesis on Tarsus Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:TARS) in the following words, according to TipRanks:“Commercially led by eye care veteran CCO Mottiwala (ex-VP Marketing Allergan Eye Care), TARS is well-positioned to develop a new category, eyelid health. We are particularly encouraged by market research revealing an intent to prescribe for demodex blepharitis (DB) of 93%. As awareness grows, our conviction in TP-03’s market potential is reinforced. Additionally, we believe TP-03 could benefit from key differences between DB and dry eye disease (DED) markets. Finally, although we currently don’t value TARS’ pipeline, we believe it should not be dismissed and see multiple opportunities for growth and monetization.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 37Utility company AES Corp (NYSE:AES) ranks 9th in our list of the best stocks that will make you rich in the next 5 to 10 years according to Wall Street analysts.Sarat Sethi, DCLA managing partner, believes the stock AES Corp (NYSE:AES) has strong earnings growth potential for the next three to five years. The analyst also praised the stock’s dividend yield.Massif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Given interest rates’ elevated state, it is perhaps unsurprising that our utility exposure has fared poorly for us this year. We should have hedged the exposure sooner with a Utility ETF short, but we did not do that until the third quarter, after much of the damage was already done. As noted above, our Utility exposure is second only to our materials exposure in terms of negative impact on the portfolio across both the third quarter and the YTD periods. This is primarily driven by our investment in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), which was down roughly 26% in the third quarter and 47% YTD. Our other utility exposure is up for the year, including our short position, which, as noted, was put on in the third quarter, and it is probably something we should have had on the books for the entire year.We attribute, for right or wrong, the entirety of the sell-off in AES to the interest rate environment. Chart overlays are always tricky, so one should not read too much into them, but as a quick sense check of the claim, if one inverts the move-in rates for a generic 10-year US government bond and overlay it with AES stock price YTD, you get the following:..” (Click here to read the full text)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 68Sarat Sethi of DCLA managing partner likes Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) as a stock to buy and hold for the next few years because of its strong cash flow, growing dividend and a “very strong management team.”As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). The most significant stake ($1.42 billion) in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is owned by Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management.ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Long-term holdings Charter and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) delivered strong second-quarter results relative to expectations; their stable recurring revenue streams and undemanding valuations were rewarded in the current environment. Cable multiples compressed over the past 24 months on fears of heightened competition in their core broadband business from fixed wireless and fiber providers. While fiber remains a competitive alternative to cable broadband over the long term, high upfront investments and a materially higher cost of capital are resulting in slower buildouts than previously expected. Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating. At the same time, both Comcast and Charter are expanding their footprints into rural and adjacent markets while gaining wireless market share, leveraging their mobile virtual network operator agreements with Verizon. We think both cable companies are well-positioned to continue to grow while generating substantial free cash flows. We added to Comcast during the quarter.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 73Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) is one of the stocks that has the potential to gain a lot in value over the next few years, according to Sarat Sethi, DCLA managing partner. The analyst said while talking to CNBC that Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) is set to gain on the back of an increase in demand for EVs and copper.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 73 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in the company. Like FCX, hedge funds are loading up on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 81Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is perhaps one of the most divisive stocks out there, with some analysts saying the stock will fall while others saying the stock would skyrocket.Cathie Wood of ARK Invest believes Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could hit $2000 by 2027. Wedbush's Dan Ives, who is also a notable Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) bull, recently said in a program on CNBC that there are signs that demand for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles remains strong. He said that it’s important to differentiate between demand trends in the broader EV industry and demand for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles. In addition to Tesla, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are among the top stocks hedge funds and Wall Street analysts are buying.Here is what White Brook Capital has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth.

AES Completes Construction of 3.5 GW of Renewables in 2023`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aes-completes-construction-3-5-120000296.html`2024-01-18 12:00:00`"Construction Milestone Marks the Largest Renewables Capacity Addition by AES in a Single YearARLINGTON, Va., Jan. 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) announced the completion of 3.5 GW of renewables projects in 2023, nearly doubling the capacity constructed compared to 2022.""In 2023, AES completed the construction of 3.5 GW of new renewables. This construction milestone represents a new record and a growth rate of nearly 100% over 2022. Including these newly added projects, AES' portfolio of renewables now reaches 18.4 GW,"" said Andrés Gluski, AES President and Chief Executive Officer.Of the 3.5 GW of projects that AES completed, 1.6 GW are solar, 1.3 GW are wind and 0.6 GW are energy storage. Examples of notable projects completed in 2023 include:Great Cove Solar is a 220 MW project comprised of two solar facilities in Franklin and Fulton Counties, Pennsylvania being commissioned in multiple phases. It is the largest solar project in the Commonwealth and the University of Pennsylvania will purchase all electricity produced at the sites. The project will generate enough energy to power 70% of the total electricity demand of Penn's academic campuses and the University of Pennsylvania Health System, helping to support the University's goal of achieving a 100% carbon neutral campus by 2042. The project will also host a research study onsite in partnership with Penn's Environmental Innovations Initiative, which could offer the industry insight on best practices for soil health management on operational solar projects.Chevelon Butte Wind is a 238 MW wind project, and Phase 1 of a 454 MW wind facility in Coconino and Navajo counties, Arizona. Once Phase 2 becomes operational this year, collectively it will be the state's largest wind farm. The project is sited on the Chevelon Butte Ranch, one of the oldest working cattle ranches in Arizona. The facility is compatible with existing livestock ranching and hunting land uses, enabling the landowner family and Arizona State Land Department to continue the more than century-long tradition of raising livestock and stewarding the land.McFarland A Solar-plus-Storage is a 200 MW solar and 100 MW energy storage project located in Yuma County, Arizona. As one of the largest solar-plus-storage projects in the state, this facility represents the next generation of sustainable energy infrastructure powering a more secure and reliable electric grid. The project has already created hundreds of jobs in the region during construction.Oak Ridge Solar is a 200 MW solar facility located in Morehouse Parish, Louisiana. Oak Ridge Solar is the largest operating solar project in the state and will provide low-cost electricity while reducing carbon emissions and generating economic benefits for the local Morehouse Parish community. This project not only represents a high-value economic investment in the region but also supports Louisiana solar energy growth.About AESThe AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) is a Fortune 500 global energy company accelerating the future of energy.

Production per share(3) increased six per cent compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.ARC recognized both funds from operations and cash flow from operating activities of $699 million(4) ($1.16 per share)(5) during the fourth quarter. ARC generated free funds flow of $155 million(6) ($0.26 per share)(7) and recognized net income of $506 million ($0.84 per share).End market diversification resulted in an average realized natural gas price of $3.33 per Mcf(5); 25 per cent greater than the average AECO 7A Monthly Index price of $2.66 Mcf.Fourth quarter combined operating and transportation cost of $8.72 per boe registered as the lowest in two years.ARC invested $545 million into capital expenditures(6), in-line with Company guidance. ARC disposed of certain non-core assets for net proceeds of $44 million during the fourth quarter, with the proceeds re-invested through the repurchase of ARC shares.ARC repurchased 8.4 million shares during the fourth quarter. In the five months since renewing its normal course issuer bid (""NCIB"") on September 1, 2023, ARC has repurchased 10.6 million common shares, or 17 per cent of its allotment under the current NCIB. Since instituting the NCIB in September of 2021, ARC has repurchased 18 per cent of its common shares outstanding.In the fourth quarter of 2023, ARC announced that it entered into a long-term natural gas supply agreement with Sabine Pass Liquefaction Stage V, LLC, a subsidiary of Cheniere Energy, Inc. (""Cheniere"") for approximately 140 MMcf per day that is expected to commence by 2029. Under the agreement, ARC will supply natural gas and will receive a liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") price based on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (""TTF""), after fixed deductions for liquefaction, shipping, and regasification fees.Attachie Phase I is progressing on-schedule and on budget. Initial commissioning volumes are anticipated in late 2024, with full production expected in the first quarter of 2025.Year-end 2023 ResultsARC generated record annual production in 2023 averaging 351,954 boe per day (63 per cent natural gas and 37 per cent crude oil and liquids), an increase of 11 per cent per share compared to 2022.ARC generated free funds flow of $790 million ($1.29 per share) in 2023 and distributed 110 per cent (96 per cent net of proceeds from divestitures) of free funds flow to shareholders.

The 2P NPV considers the development of 20 per cent of ARC's internally identified inventory.ARC booked 90 MMboe of 2P reserves at Attachie, representing approximately five years of development at Attachie Phase I. The 116 undeveloped locations booked at year-end 2023 represent seven per cent of ARC's internal inventory estimate at Attachie, providing a considerable runway for future reserve growth.Reserves were a record across all categories - increasing by between 12 per cent and 13 per cent per share on a proved producing (""PDP""), proved (""1P"") and 2P basis.Kakwa PDP reserves increased by five per cent. This was due to strong performance from the 2023 development program and positive technical revisions, which resulted in an increase in reserve life index (""RLI"") across all three categories (PDP, 1P, and 2P).2P reserve adds of 310 MMboe were the largest in ARC's 28-year history, and for the 16th consecutive year, ARC's 2P reserve replacement from development activities was greater than 140 per cent of production.For the first time since the strategic combination with Seven Generations, ARC conducted a third-party Resource Evaluation of its Montney properties to quantify resource quality and inventory depth. The study included an estimate of unrisked economic contingent resource of 15 Tcf and 920 MMbbl, in addition to ARC's 2P reserves of 8 Tcf and 670 MMbbl.The study estimates a contingent plus prospective well inventory of 4,900 locations at its Montney properties, over and above the 1,000 well inventory that forms ARC's before-tax 2P NPV of $38.00 per share.ARC's consolidated financial statements and notes (the ""financial statements"") and Management's Discussion and Analysis (""MD&A"") as at and for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, are available on ARC's website at www.arcresources.com and under ARC's SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca. The disclosures under the section entitled ""Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures"" in ARC's MD&A as at and for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 (the ""2023 Annual MD&A"") is incorporated by reference in this news release.(1)ARC has adopted the standard six thousand cubic feet (""Mcf"") of natural gas to one barrel (""bbl"") of crude oil ratio when converting natural gas to barrels of oil equivalent (""boe""). Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf:1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different than the energy equivalency of the 6:1 conversion ratio, utilizing the 6:1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value.(2)Throughout this news release, crude oil (""crude oil"") refers to light, medium, and heavy crude oil product types as defined by National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (""NI 51-101"").

Production, reserves, and safety performance achieved 28-year records, and the sanctioning of Attachie and execution of subsequent LNG supply agreements provided greater visibility into ARC's long-term growth plans and margin expansion initiatives.In 2024, ARC will build on this operating momentum to achieve the goals of the five-year outlook introduced in 2023. This will be defined and measured by a capital efficient Montney development program and by completing the first phase of Attachie on-time and on budget. Consistent with 2023, ARC expects to return substantially all of its free funds flow to shareholders through a growing base dividend(1) and share repurchases under its NCIB to provide a competitive and sustainable total return.Execution of this plan is expected to drive an increase in profitable production growth and free funds flow per share beginning in 2025.Operations UpdateFirst quarter 2024 operations are progressing as planned. Drilling and completions activities have commenced at Attachie, and the extreme cold weather experienced in early January 2024 had no material impact to operations.Production in the first quarter is anticipated to average between 340,000 and 350,000 boe per day (63 per cent natural gas and 37 per cent crude oil and liquids) as planned within the 2024 budget. Growth in the second half of the year is expected to be driven by Kakwa, Sunrise, and start-up volumes from Attachie Phase I later in the year.Attachie Phase I UpdateAttachie Phase I development remains on schedule and on budget. ARC invested approximately $250 million in capital expenditures at Attachie in 2023.Completion of Attachie Phase I is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024 with commissioning volumes expected before year-end. Facility capacity for the first phase is 40,000 boe per day (40 per cent natural gas and 60 per cent crude oil and liquids).Facilities and related infrastructure are approximately 30 per cent complete.The natural gas sales line is complete; water ponds are complete and being utilized for drilling and completion activities; gathering pipelines are 40 per cent complete.ARC successfully drilled its first pad and commenced completion activities. ARC currently has two drilling rigs active at Attachie.Construction of the transmission and distribution lines to enable the electrification of the facility is on-track for start-up, which will lower ARC's emissions intensity.The permitting process is progressing well and ARC continues to receive additional permits working collaboratively with the neighbouring Treaty 8 First Nations in support of the multi-year development project.(1) Subject to the approval of ARC's board of directors (the ""Board"").The outlook through 2025 is outlined below, subject to Board approval.20242025Total production (boe/day)350,000 - 360,000375,000 - 400,000  Natural gas production (%)63 %60 %  Crude oil and liquids production (%)37 %40 %Capital Expenditures ($ billions)(1)1.75 - 1.851.6 - 1.8Funds from Operations ($ billions)(2)(3)2.5 - 2.82.9 - 3.2(1)Refer to the section entitled ""About ARC Resources Ltd."" contained within the 2023 Annual MD&A for historical capital expenditures, which information is incorporated by reference into this news release.(2)Based on the forward curve at January 25, 2024 (2024: WTI US$75 per barrel; US$2.60/MMbtu NYMEX; C$2.15/Mcf AECO; 2025: WTI US$71 per barrel; US$3.50/MMbtu NYMEX; C$3.30Mcf AECO).(3)See Note 15 ""Capital Management"" in the financial statements and ""Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures"" in the 2023 Annual MD&A for information relating to this capital management measure, which information is incorporated by reference into this news release.GuidanceFull-year 2024 guidance is unchanged and detailed in the table below.Planned capital expenditures of between $1.75 to $1.85 billion(3), which includes approximately $500 million to complete and commission Attachie Phase I.Average annual production of between 350,000 and 360,000 boe per day (63 per cent natural gas and 37 per cent crude oil and liquids).Kakwa production is expected to average approximately 180,000 boe per day (approximately 60 per cent crude oil and liquids) as previously disclosed (175,000 boe per day upon expiry of the ethane sales contract in the second quarter of 2024).ARC's 2024 corporate guidance is based on various commodity price scenarios and economic conditions; certain guidance estimates may fluctuate with commodity price changes and regulatory changes.

Production per share increased six per cent compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.Fourth quarter production exceeded fourth quarter guidance of 355,000 boe per day, due to stronger production across the asset base.Full-year production averaged a record 351,954 boe per day (63 per cent natural gas and 37 per cent crude oil and liquids). Production was in-line with guidance and represented a two per cent increase (11 per cent on a per share basis) from average daily production in 2022.Production in the first quarter of 2024 is estimated to average between 340,000 to 350,000 boe per day (63 per cent natural gas and 37 per cent crude oil and liquids).Funds from Operations, Cash Flow from Operating Activities, and Free Funds FlowFourth quarter 2023 funds from operations and cash from operating activities were each $699 million ($1.16 per share). Funds from operations increased six per cent from the third quarter of 2023, driven by a combination of higher production volumes, lower operating expense, G&A expense, and current income tax expense.In 2023, ARC generated funds from operations of $2.6 billion ($4.32 per share) and cash from operating activities of $2.4 billion ($3.92 per share).Fourth quarter and full-year 2023 free funds flow was $155 million ($0.26 per share) and $790 million ($1.29 per share), respectively.The following table details the change in funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2023 relative to the third quarter of 2023.Funds from Operations Reconciliation$ millions$/share(1)Funds from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023662.21.09Production volumesCrude oil and liquids(8.8)(0.01)Natural gas7.50.01Commodity pricesCrude oil and liquids(27.8)(0.04)Natural gas21.30.02Sales of commodities purchased from third parties11.10.02Other income(0.5)—Realized loss on risk management contracts1.6—Royalties(17.6)(0.03)ExpensesCommodities purchased from third parties(12.8)(0.02)Operating25.00.04Transportation9.60.02G&A15.20.02Interest and financing(4.0)(0.01)Current income tax18.50.03Realized gain on foreign exchange(0.9)—Other(0.4)—Weighted average shares, diluted—0.02Funds from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2023699.21.16(1)  Per share amounts are based on weighted average diluted common shares.Shareholder ReturnsIn 2023, ARC returned 110 per cent (96 per cent net of proceeds from divestitures) of free funds flow to shareholders through the base dividend and share repurchases.In the first quarter of 2023, the Board approved an increase of 13 per cent to the Company's quarterly dividend, from $0.15 per share to $0.17 per share.During the fourth quarter, ARC distributed 183 per cent (143 per cent net of proceeds from divestitures) or $284 million ($0.47 per share) of free funds flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases under its NCIB.During the fourth quarter 2023, ARC declared dividends of $102 million ($0.17 per share).ARC repurchased 8.4 million common shares under its NCIB at a weighted average price of $21.65 per share.Since commencing its initial NCIB in September 2021, ARC has repurchased approximately 18 per cent of total outstanding shares or 131 million common shares, at a weighted average price of $16.06 per share.ARC will continue to repurchase common shares when the intrinsic value of the Company's common shares exceeds the current market trading price. ARC determines the intrinsic value using a discounted cash flow framework under a range of commodity price assumptions and discount rates.ARC intends to continue to distribute essentially all of its free funds flow to shareholders given its strong financial position.Operating, Transportation, and General and Administrative ExpenseOperating ExpenseARC's fourth quarter 2023 operating expense of $4.13 per boe decreased 16 per cent from the third quarter of 2023, due to lower planned maintenance activity and higher production.Full-year 2023 operating expense of $4.59 per boe was in-line with Company guidance.Operating expense per boe in 2024 is anticipated to average between $4.50 to $4.90 per boe.Transportation ExpenseARC's fourth quarter 2023 transportation expense per boe of $4.59 decreased by seven per cent or $0.35 per boe from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher volumes and lower than anticipated crude oil and liquids transportation costs.ARC's full-year 2023 transportation expense of $5.11 per boe was below ARC's guidance range of $5.50 to $6.00 per boe primarily due to modifications of certain natural gas transportation contracts and lower fuel gas expense.General and Administrative ExpenseARC's fourth quarter 2023 general and administrative expense before share-based compensation expense per boe of $1.43 increased by $0.42 per boe from the third quarter of 2023. The increase is due to an enterprise system implementation that increased consulting and technology costs.ARC's full-year 2023 general and administrative expense of $1.65 per boe was above Company guidance primarily due to share-based compensation expense driven by share price appreciation.Cash Flow Used in Investing Activities and Capital ExpendituresCash flow used in investing activities was $434 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $545 million. ARC drilled 37 wells and completed 33 wells during the quarter, focused mainly at Attachie, Kakwa, and Greater Dawson.ARC executed its 2023 capital program efficiently and had a record year in terms of safety performance.Cash flow used in investing activities was $1.7 billion. ARC invested $1.8 billion in capital expenditures to drill 148 wells and complete 151 wells.The following table details ARC's 2023 drilling and completion activities by area.Year Ended December 31, 2023AreaWells Drilled(1)(2)Wells Completed(1)Kakwa7588Greater Dawson3836Sunrise2617Ante Creek610Attachie3—Total148151(1)  Wells drilled and completed for operated assets only.(2)  Excludes disposal wells.Physical Natural Gas MarketingARC's infrastructure ownership and committed takeaway capacity to end markets played a critical role in mitigating AECO volatility and capturing additional margin in periods of price volatility in North America.ARC's average realized natural gas price during the fourth quarter was $3.33 per Mcf, 25 per cent higher than the average AECO 7A Monthly Index price for the period.Full-year 2023 market diversification activities resulted in an average realized natural gas price of $3.77 per Mcf; 29 per cent greater than the average AECO 7A Monthly Index price.In the fourth quarter 2023, ARC entered into a long-term natural gas supply agreement with Cheniere. The agreement commences with the commercial operations of the first train of the Sabine Pass Stage 5 Expansion Project SPL Expansion Project, which is anticipated to occur by 2029.ARC will supply 140 MMbtu per day of natural gas for 15 years, and will receive an LNG price based on the TTF price, after fixed deductions for liquefaction, shipping and regasification fees.ARC plans to market up to 25 per cent of its future natural gas production to international markets with revenue linked to international or LNG pricing.Net DebtAs of December 31, 2023, ARC's long-term debt balance was $1.1 billion, and its net debt balance was $1.3 billion, or 0.5 times funds from operations.ARC targets its net debt to be in the range of or below 1.0 times funds from operations and manages its capital structure to achieve that target over the long-term.Long-term debt is comprised of $155 million of syndicated credit facilities and $1.0 billion of senior notes outstanding.Subsequent to year-end, ARC extended its credit facility by one year to a maturity date of February 2028 and reduced the capacity to $1.7 billion from $1.8 billion.ARC holds an investment-grade credit rating, which allows the Company to have access to capital and to manage a low-cost capital structure. ARC is committed to protecting its strong financial position by maintaining significant financial flexibility with its balance sheet.Net IncomeARC recognized net income of $506 million ($0.84 per share) during the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $270 million ($0.45 per share) from the third quarter 2023.In 2023, ARC recognized net income of $1.6 billion ($2.61 per share), compared to net income of $2.3 billion ($3.47 per share) in 2022. The decrease in net income compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower average realized commodity prices.2023 RESERVESHighlightsARC's before-tax NPV for 2P reserves of $38.00 per share represented a 13 per cent increase compared to 2022. The before-tax NPV of $23.0 billion, discounted at 10 per cent, registered as the highest in ARC's 28-year history.ARC's NPV for 2P reserves of $38.00 per share is based on the development of approximately 1,000 gross 2P locations, which represents 20 per cent of the Company's total gross internal inventory estimates.ARC's before-tax PDP NPV, discounted at 10 per cent, registered at $14.00 per share, and $26.00 per share on a 1P basis.ARC's NPV was determined using GLJ's forecast pricing and foreign exchange rates at January 1, 2024, with a 10-year average WTI price of US$81 per barrel and a 10-year average AECO price of $4.23 per million MMBtu.Reserves were a record across all categories - increasing by between 12 per cent and 13 per cent per share on a PDP, 1P and 2P basis.Reserve growth was primarily driven by development additions at Attachie and positive technical revisions and drilling extensions at Kakwa and Sunrise.ARC booked 90 MMboe of 2P reserves at Attachie, representing approximately five years of development at Attachie Phase I. The 116 undeveloped locations booked at year-end 2023 represent seven per cent of ARC's internal inventory estimate at Attachie, providing a considerable runway for future reserve growth.PDP reserves increased 43 MMboe or eight per cent (12 per cent per share) to 591 MMboe, driven by positive technical revisions and drilling extensions.2P reserves increased by nine per cent, and 13 per cent on a per share basis. The increase was driven by development at Attachie, Sunrise, and Kakwa.Kakwa reserves increased by five per cent on a PDP basis, and between one and two per cent on each of a 1P and 2P basis, respectively. The increase was driven by positive technical revisions and drilling extensions, which more than offset the previously announced ethane sales contract expiry in the second quarter of 2024 that resulted in a decrease in barrels of oil equivalent, as shown in the economic category.RLI at Kakwa increased across all categories (PDP RLI 4.8 years; 2P RLI 14.2 years), and is based on approximately 44 per cent of the internally identified inventory at Kakwa.2P reserves of 1,994 MMboe were a record, driven by organic reserve growth at Attachie, Sunrise and Kakwa. Attachie comprised 12 per cent of total 2P locations with 116 undeveloped drilling locations booked.PDP finding, development and acquisition (""FD&A"") costs, including future development capital (""FDC"") of $9.81 per boe(1) equated to a 2.5 times(2) PDP FD&A recycle ratio.FDC for 2P reserves totaled $10.0 billion at December 31, 2023 as compared to $9.1 billion at December 31, 2022. This 10 per cent increase in FDC is primarily due to the sanctioning of Attachie Phase I.FDC for 2P reserves equates to 5.6 times the mid-point of ARC's 2024 capital budget.ARC's RLI increased on a PDP, 1P, and 2P basis in 2023, driven by strong technical revisions and drilling extensions.(1)Non-GAAP ratio that is not a standardized financial measure under IFRS Accounting Standards and may not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers.

release and in other materials disclosed by the Company, ARC employs certain measures to analyze its financial performance, financial position, and cash flow. These non-GAAP and other financial measures are not standardized financial measures under IFRS Accounting Standards and may not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. The non-GAAP and other financial measures should not be considered to be more meaningful than generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") measures which are determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, such as net income, cash flow from operating activities, and cash flow used in investing activities, as indicators of ARC's performance.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresCapital ExpendituresARC uses capital expenditures to monitor its capital investments relative to those budgeted by the Company on an annual basis. ARC's capital budget excludes acquisition or disposition activities as well as the accounting impact of any accrual changes and payments under certain lease arrangements. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to capital expenditures is cash flow used in investing activities. The following table details the composition of capital expenditures and its reconciliation to cash flow used in investing activities.Three Months EndedYear EndedCapital Expenditures($ millions)September 30, 2023December 31, 2023December 31, 2022December 31, 2023December 31, 2022Cash flow used in investing activities394.6434.3350.71,690.71,413.2Acquisition of crude oil and natural gas assets——(0.1)(0.5)(2.7)Disposal of crude oil and natural gas assets—44.2—117.811.9Long-term investments(0.7)(0.3)(3.3)(5.4)(12.0)Change in non-cash investing working capital3.960.130.135.215.7Other (1)3.66.25.912.015.8Capital expenditures401.4544.5383.31,849.81,441.9(1)  Comprises non-cash capitalized costs related to the Company's right-of-use asset depreciation and share-based compensation.Free Funds FlowARC uses free funds flow as an indicator of the efficiency and liquidity of ARC's business, measuring its funds after capital investment available to manage debt levels, pay dividends, and return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. ARC computes free funds flow as funds from operations generated during the period less capital expenditures. Capital expenditures is a non-GAAP financial measure. By removing the impact of current period capital expenditures from funds from operations, Management monitors its free funds flow to inform its capital allocation decisions. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to free funds flow is cash flow from operating activities. The following table details the calculation of free funds flow and its reconciliation to cash flow from operating activities.Three Months EndedYear EndedFree Funds Flow($ millions)September 30, 2023December 31, 2023December 31, 2022December 31, 2023December 31, 2022Cash flow from operating activities604.2698.9878.32,394.33,833.3Net change in other liabilities7.91.613.99.3129.2Change in non-cash operating working capital50.1(1.3)94.0236.0(250.0)Funds from operations662.2699.2986.22,639.63,712.5Capital expenditures(1)(401.4)(544.5)(383.3)(1,849.8)(1,441.9)Free funds flow260.8154.7602.9789.82,270.6(1)Certain additional disclosures for these specified financial measures have been incorporated by reference. See ""Cash Flow used in Investing Activities, Capital Expenditures, Acquisitions, and Dispositions"" in the 2023 Annual MD&A.Adjusted Net Capital AcquisitionsAdjusted net capital acquisitions is a non-GAAP financial measure used in the determination of FD&A costs, which is a non-GAAP ratio. Adjusted net capital acquisitions is useful as it provides a measure of cash, debt, and share consideration used to acquire crude oil and natural gas assets during the period, net of cash provided by the disposal of any crude oil and natural gas assets during the period. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to adjusted net capital acquisitions is acquisition of crude oil and natural gas assets. The following table details the calculation of adjusted net capital acquisitions and its reconciliation to acquisition of crude oil and natural gas assets.Adjusted Net Capital AcquisitionsYear EndedYear Ended($ millions)December 31, 2023December 31, 2022Acquisition of crude oil and natural gas assets(0.5)2.7Remove:Disposal of crude oil and natural gas assets117.8(11.9)Adjusted net capital acquisitions117.3(9.2)Non-GAAP RatiosFinding and Development CostsARC calculates F&D costs as capital expenditures divided by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category. ARC calculates F&D costs, including FDC, as the sum of capital expenditures and the change in FDC required to bring the reserves on production, divided by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category. Capital expenditures, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used as a component of F&D costs. Management uses F&D costs as a measure of capital efficiency for organic reserves development.Finding, Development and Acquisition CostsARC calculates FD&A costs as the sum of capital expenditures and adjusted net capital acquisitions divided by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category, inclusive of changes due to acquisitions and dispositions. ARC calculates FD&A costs, including FDC, as the sum of capital expenditures, adjusted net capital acquisitions, and the change in FDC required to bring the reserves on production, divided by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category, inclusive of changes due to acquisitions and dispositions. Capital expenditures and adjusted net capital acquisitions, both non-GAAP financial measures, are used as components of FD&A costs. Management uses FD&A costs as a measure of capital efficiency for organic and acquired reserves development.Recycle RatioARC calculates recycle ratio by dividing the netback per boe by F&D or FD&A costs. Netback per boe is a non-GAAP ratio that uses netback, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a component. Capital expenditures, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used as a component of F&D costs. Capital expenditures and adjusted net capital acquisitions, both non-GAAP financial measures, are used as components of FD&A costs. Management uses recycle ratio to relate the cost of adding reserves to the expected cash flows to be generated.Supplementary Financial MeasuresBefore-tax Proved plus Probable Net Present Value per ShareBefore-tax 2P NPV per share is comprised of the before-tax NPV for 2P reserves, discounted at 10 per cent, as determined in accordance with NI 51-101, divided by common shares outstanding at the end of the period.2023 INDEPENDENT QUALIFIED RESERVES EVALUATIONGLJ conducted a Reserves Evaluation, effective December 31, 2023, which was prepared in accordance with definitions, standards, and procedures in the COGE Handbook and NI 51-101. The Reserves Evaluation was based on GLJ forecast pricing and foreign exchange rates at January 1, 2024, as outlined in the table below. These forecasts reflect current market conditions as defined by current forward commodity prices as at December 31, 2023. This aligns with the COGE Handbook, effective April 1, 2021, which states that major benchmark commodity price forecasts, up to and including the second full forecast year, should not deviate from current forward commodity prices by more than 20 per cent.Reserves included herein are stated on a company gross basis (working interest before deduction of royalties without the inclusion of any royalty interest) unless otherwise noted.ARC's crude oil and natural gas reserves statement for the year ended December 31, 2023, including complete disclosure of the Company's crude oil and natural gas reserves and other crude oil and natural gas information in accordance with NI 51-101, will be disclosed in ARC's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2023, which will be available on or before March 31, 2024 on ARC's website at www.arcresources.com and under ARC's SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca.ARC also engaged GLJ to provide an evaluation of its contingent resources effective December 31, 2023 for its working interest Montney properties as at December 31, 2023. See our supplementary filing titled ""Other"" and dated February 8, 2024 which has been filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca for additional details with respect to ARC's contingent resources, including the risks and uncertainties related thereto.Summary of GLJ January 1, 2024 Forecast Prices and Inflation Rate AssumptionsGLJ PriceForecast(1)WTICrude Oil(US$/bbl)EdmontonLight Oil(Cdn$/bbl)NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas(US$/MMBtu)AECONatural Gas(Cdn$/MMBtu)Foreign Exchange(US$/Cdn$)2024202320242023202420232024202320242023202472.5075.0089.4095.302.754.502.014.770.7550.745202575.0075.4394.0494.503.854.273.424.470.7550.755202676.9976.9495.3195.144.164.354.304.490.7650.765202778.5378.4897.2295.794.254.444.394.530.7650.775202880.1080.0599.1697.704.334.534.474.620.7650.775202981.7081.65101.1499.664.424.624.564.710.7650.775203083.3483.28103.16101.654.504.714.654.800.7650.775203185.0084.95105.23103.684.604.804.754.890.7650.775203286.7086.65107.33104.314.694.904.844.990.7650.7752033(2)88.44109.484.784.940.7650.775Escalate    thereafter at +2.0%per year +2.0%per year +2.0%per year +2.0%per year +2.0%per year +2.0%per year +2.0%per year +2.0%per year0.7650.775(1)GLJ assigns a value to ARC's existing physical diversification contracts for natural gas to consuming markets across North America based upon GLJ's forecast differential to NYMEX Henry Hub, contracted volumes, and transportation expense.

Reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates as follows:Proved Reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves.Probable Reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.Information Regarding Disclosure on Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Operational InformationIn accordance with Canadian practice, production volumes and revenues are reported on a company gross basis, before deduction of Crown and other royalties, and without including any royalty interests, unless otherwise stated. Unless otherwise specified, all reserves volumes in this news release (and all information derived therefrom) are based on company gross reserves using forecast prices and costs.This news release contains metrics commonly used in the crude oil and natural gas industry. These metrics do not have standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar metrics disclosed by other issuers. See ""Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures"" of this news release and the definition of reserve replacement below. Management uses these metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide shareholders with measures to compare ARC's performance over time; however, such measures are not reliable indicators of ARC's future performance and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods.Reserves replacement is calculated by dividing the annual reserves additions, in boe, by ARC's annual production, in boe. Management uses this measure to determine the relative change of its reserves base over a period of time.This news release discloses drilling inventory in three categories: (i) proved plus probable (2P) locations; (ii) contingent resources (2C) drilling locations; and (iii) prospective resources (PR) drilling locations. 2P locations are derived from the report prepared by GLJ, evaluating ARC's reserves as of December 31, 2023 (the ""GLJ Reserve Report""), and account for drilling locations that have associated proved plus probable reserves. 2C drilling locations are derived from a report prepared by GLJ evaluating ARC's contingent and prospective resources as of December 31, 2021 (the ""GLJ Resource Report""), and account for drilling locations that have associated contingent resources based on a best estimate of such contingent resources. PR drilling locations are derived from the GLJ Resource Report, and account for drilling locations that have associated prospective resources based on a best estimate of such prospective resources. Of the roughly 6,000 total drilling locations identified herein, 1,048 are 2P, 3,612 are 2C, and 1,275 are PR locations. Contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Prospective resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. Prospective Resources are further subdivided in accordance with the level of certainty associated with recoverable estimates assuming their discovery and development and may be subclassified based on project maturity. Economic contingent resources are those contingent resources that are currently economically recoverable. The sub-classes included under economic contingent resources are Development Pending CR, Development on Hold CR, and Development Unclarified CR. Development Pending are resources where resolution of the final conditions for development is being actively pursued (high chance of development). Development on Hold are resources where there is a reasonable chance of development but there are major non-technical contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the control of the operator. Development Unclarified are resources where the evaluation is incomplete and there is ongoing activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties. Development Not Viable are resources that are not viable in the conditions prevailing at the effective date of the evaluation, and where no further data acquisition or evaluation is currently planned and hence there is a low chance of development.There is no certainty that ARC will drill all drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas production. The drilling locations on which ARC will drill wells will ultimately depend upon the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, oil and natural gas prices, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors.This news release contains estimates of the NPV of the Company's future net revenue from reserves associated with ARC's assets. Such amounts do not represent the fair market value of such reserves. The recovery and reserve estimates provided herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. The NPV of the assets' base production is a snapshot in time and is based on the reserves evaluated using applicable pricing assumptions. It should not be assumed that the undiscounted or discounted NPV of future net revenue attributable to the assets represents the fair market value of those assets. The estimates for reserves for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves for all properties due to the effects of aggregation. The recovery and reserve estimates of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates relied upon for NPV calculations, herein.FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION AND STATEMENTSThis news release contains certain forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively referred to as ""forward-looking information"") within the meaning of applicable securities legislation about current expectations regarding the future based on certain assumptions made by ARC.

Is Weakness In ARC Resources Ltd. (TSE:ARX) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-arc-resources-ltd-tse-134832281.html`2024-01-20 13:48:32`"With its stock down 8.7% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard ARC Resources (TSE:ARX). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ARC Resources' ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for ARC Resources Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ARC Resources is:26% = CA$1.8b ÷ CA$7.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each CA$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made CA$0.26 in profit.So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Firstly, we acknowledge that ARC Resources has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 17% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, ARC Resources' exceptional 63% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.We then compared ARC Resources' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 42% in the same 5-year period.Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is ARX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.ARC Resources' ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 19% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (81%) of its profits. So it looks like ARC Resources is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, ARC Resources is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 19%. Still, forecasts suggest that ARC Resources' future ROE will drop to 18% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.In total, we are pretty happy with ARC Resources' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

10 Best Cheap Car Insurance in New Jersey for 2024`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-cheap-car-insurance-044933087.html`2024-02-07 04:49:33`In this article we will look at the 10 Best Cheap Car Insurance in New Jersey for 2024. If you want to skip the detailed analysis, you may go to 5 Best Cheap Car Insurance in New Jersey for 2024.Motor insurance serves as a vital safeguard for owners of cars, two-wheelers, commercial trucks, and other road vehicles, shielding them from financial losses due to accidents or physical damages. Furthermore, it offers protection against legal liabilities stemming from accidents resulting in injuries, deaths, or property damage to a third party.To cater to the evolving demands of customers, insurance companies now provide diverse plans and add-ons. These offerings include cashless claims, depreciation cover, 24/7 road assistance, and towing facilities to deliver comprehensive coverage and streamlined assistance throughout the claiming process. One of the driving forces behind the thriving motor insurance market is the steady rise in the number of vehicles on roads. With the increasing global presence of private cars, the risk of road accidents and vehicle damage escalates, thereby creating significant demand for motor insurance worldwide.Furthermore, many governing agencies now require businesses to acquire motor insurance for their commercial vehicles, encompassing auto-rickshaws, cabs, school buses, tractors, vans, and trucks. Additionally, the growing utilization of commercial vehicles for inter-city passenger travel and the transportation of goods contributes to the buoyancy of the market. As these vehicles become increasingly prevalent, the need for motor insurance proportionally rises.Furthermore, insurance companies are adapting to the digital era by offering online insurance solutions. Through hassle-free and fully digital platforms for policy comparison, purchasing, and renewal, insurers facilitate a seamless and convenient process. This transition, coupled with the expanding internet penetration and reliance on smartphones, has led to a widespread adoption of motor insurance worldwide.Another promising development in the market is the emergence of usage-based vehicle insurance (UBI). This approach utilizes individualized data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to determine insurance premiums. By analyzing actual vehicle usage, insurers can offer tailor-made policies that encourage responsible driving habits and potentially lower insurance costs for customers.The global motor insurance market has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, and experts anticipate this upward trajectory to continue.

This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for AFLThe RSI reading of 29.97 for AFL is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering AFL in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 1.3% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Moreover, AFL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Young, Vice President of Investor and Rating Agency Relations for Aflac Incorporated. Please go ahead.David Young: Good morning and welcome. This morning, we will be hearing remarks about earnings for 2023 as well as our outlook for 2024. First, Dan Amos, Chairman, CEO, and President of Aflac Incorporated will provide an overview of our results and operations in Japan and the United States. Then Max Broden, Executive Vice-President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated, will provide an update on our financial results and current capital and liquidity, as well as our outlook for 2024. These topics are also addressed in the materials we posted with our earnings release and financial supplement on investors.aflac.com. In addition, Max provided his quarterly video update, which also includes information about the outlook for 2024. We also posted, under Financials, on the same site, updated slides of investment details related to our commercial real-estate and middle-market loans.For Q&A, we are also joined by Virgil Miller, President of Aflac U.S.; Charles Lake, Chairman and Representative Director, President of Aflac International; Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director, Aflac Life Insurance Japan; and Brad Dyslin, Global Chief Investment Officer, President of Aflac Global Investments. Before we begin, some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.As I mentioned earlier, the earnings release is available on investors.aflac.com and includes reconciliations of certain non- U.S. GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to Dan. Dan?Dan Amos: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you are joining us. Reflecting on 2023, it was a very good year. Our management team, employees, sales distribution have continued to work tirelessly as dedicated stewards of our business. This has allowed us to be there for our policyholders when they need us most, just as we promised. Aflac Incorporated delivered a very strong earnings for the year. Net earnings per diluted share for 2023 were $7.78, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.23 were the best in the company's history despite the weakening yen and the impact of the reinsurance retrocession late in the fourth quarter. Beginning with Japan, Aflac Japan generated solid overall financial results in 2023.For the year, total adjusted revenues declined 3.6% to nearly ¥1.5 trillion, largely reflecting the impacts of reinsurance and paid-up policies. But this was largely offset by a 7.3% decrease in total benefits and adjusted expenses. Pre-tax adjusted earnings increased 6% to nearly ¥457 billion for the year. As a result, Aflac Japan produced an extremely strong profit margin of 30.5%. I am pleased with Aflac Japan's 10.9% year-over-year increase in sales, which was largely driven 26% increase in cancer insurance sales with very significant contributions from Japan Post Company and Japan Post Insurance as well as other alliances, Dai-ichi Life and Daido Life. As you may recall, Aflac Japan aims to have a product lined up to meet customers' needs during any life stage.Our latest medical insurance is designed to appeal to younger policyholders' basic needs and older and existing policyholders who want additional or updated coverage. While our medical insurance sales were off for the year, they increased 6.5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter following the introduction of our new medical insurance product in mid-September. Similarly, Aflac Japan refreshed WAYS and Child Endowment in 2022 as a way of acquiring younger customers and also introducing opportunities to sell our core third-sector products to them. Since the launch of our refreshed WAYS product, approximately 80% of our sales are to younger customers below the age of 50. The level of concurrent third-sector sales remains above 50%. Given Japan's demographics, our product strategy is to fit the needs of the customers at any stage in life.Acquiring younger customers is critical to our success along with our intense focus on being where the customer wants to buy insurance. We have a broad network of distribution channels, including agencies, alliance partners, and banks. This reach continually optimizes opportunities to help provide financial protection to the Japanese consumers. We are working hard to support each channel. While the market presents challenges, we expect to reach ¥67 billion to ¥73 billion of sales in Japan by the end of 2026. Turning to the U.S. We also generated strong overall financial results in 2023. Total adjusted revenues increased 2.1% to $6.6 billion. The decline in total net benefits and claims was slightly offset by the increase in adjusted expenses.Pretax adjusted earnings increased 10.4% to an all-time high of $1.5 billion for the year. As a result, Aflac U.S. produced an extremely strong profit margin of 22.7%. Aflac U.S. sales increased 5% in 2023, which was at the lower end of our expectations. As you know, we've been focused on increasing persistence to grow profitable earned premiums. In addition, we continually evaluate new business to ensure that it is profitable. During the fourth quarter, we made some tactical decisions to avoid sales opportunities to certain less profitable larger accounts like those of high turnover. At the same time, we focused on updating our products to ensure that our policyholders continue to realize the value of -- our products provide. As part of our efforts, we introduced our new cancer protection insurance policy in the second quarter of 2023.Since that time, our cancer insurance has increased nearly 25%. We know that when people experience the value of our products, it increases persistency, which benefits our policyholders and lowers our expenses. I believe that the need for the products and the solutions we offer are as strong or stronger than ever before in both Japan and the United States. We are leveraging every opportunity and avenue to share this message with consumers, particularly given that our products are sold, not bought. As we communicate the value of our products, we know that the strong brand alone is not enough. We must paint a better picture of how our products help address the gap that people face, even when they have major medical insurance. Knowing our products help lift people up when they need us most is something that makes all of us at Aflac very proud, and propels us to do more and achieve more.We continue to reinforce our leading position and build on that momentum. We are confident that the successful execution of our strategy will lead to sales of at least $1.8 billion in the U.S. by the end of 2025. I'd like to end on addressing our ongoing commitment to prudent liquidity and capital management. We have taken proactive steps in recent years to defend our cash flow and deployable capital against the weakening yen. At the end of 2023, we had nearly $2.8 billion of liquidity at the holding company, which means more than $1 billion over the minimum balance. As an insurance company, our primary responsibility is to fulfill the promises we make to our policyholders while being responsive to the needs of our shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders and balance this financial strength with the tactical capital deployment.We intend to continue prudently managing our liquidity and capital to preserve the strength of our capital and cash flows. This supports both the dividend track record and the tactical share repurchase. 2023 marked the 41st consecutive year of dividend increases. We treasure our track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it. Last quarter, the Board put us on a path to continue this record when it increased in the first quarter of 2024 dividend 19% to $0.50. We also remain in the market, repurchasing our shares through 2023 at a historically high level of $700 million per quarter. We have remained tactical in our approach to share repurchase, deploying $2.8 billion in capital to repurchase nearly 39 million of our shares in 2023.Combined with a dividend, this means we delivered over $3.8 billion back to the shareholders in 2023, while also investing in the growth of our business. At the same time, we have maintained our position among companies with the highest return on capital and the lowest cost of capital in the industry. Overall, I think we can say that it's been another strong year. I'll now turn the program over to Max, who will cover more details on the financial results for this year and provide an outlook for the key drivers of earnings in 2024. Max?Max Broden: Thank you, Dan. This morning, I'm going to address our 2023 results before providing an outlook for certain drivers for 2024 that were included in the slides with our earnings materials filed yesterday with our 8-K. Aflac Incorporated delivered very strong earnings for the year as adjusted earnings per diluted share rose 9.9% to $6.23, the highest amount in our company's history. This result included a $0.19 negative impact from foreign currency and variable investment income was $0.14 per share below our long-term return expectations. In addition, our annual results included remeasurement gains of $0.51 per share, a $0.20 per share non-economic loss in the fourth quarter under U.S. GAAP related to the innovation of our reinsurance treaty with a third-party ceded back to the company, and a $0.04 per share write-off of certain capitalized software development costs in the third quarter.Our liquidity remained strong with unencumbered holding company liquidity being $1 billion above our minimum balance. Likewise, our capital position remained strong and we ended the year with an SMR above 1,100% in Japan. At the end of 2023, we estimated our internally modeled ESR to be above 250% and we expect the FSA to provide final guidance on the ESR later in 2024. We also estimated our combined RBC in the U.S. to be greater than 650% at the end of 2023. These are strong capital ratios which we actively monitor, stress, and manage to withstand credit cycles as well as external shocks. In addition, impairments have remained within our expectations and with limited impact to both earnings and capital. Our Adjusted leverage remains below our leverage corridor of 20% to 25% at 19.7%.And this will fluctuate with the yen-dollar rate, since we hold approximately two-thirds of our debt denominated in yen as part of our enterprise hedging program to protect the economic value of Aflac Japan in U.S. dollar terms. In 2023, we repurchased $2.8 billion of our own stock and paid dividends of $245 million in Q4, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital. Adjusted book value per share increased 10.1% and the adjusted ROE was 13.8%, an acceptable spread to our cost of capital. I'm also pleased with our continued development of our Bermuda reinsurance platform, which resulted in three transactions during 2023.We will continue to utilize this platform to better manage risk and improve capital efficiency across the enterprise, and we expect these transactions to be part of a series that will improve our run-rate adjusted ROE by 100 to 200 basis points over time, all things being equal. Overall, we're very pleased with these results, especially when normalizing for one-time items. Turning to Aflac Japan. Its total benefit ratio for the year was 66%, down 140 basis points from the prior year. Throughout the year, we continue to experience favorable actual to expected on our well-priced large and mature in-force block. We estimate the impact from remeasurement gains to be 130 basis points favorable to the benefit ratio in 2023. Long-term experience trends, as it relates to the treatment of cancer and hospitalization, have continued to lead to favorable underwriting experience.Persistency remained solid with a rate of 93.4%, and was down 70 basis points year-over-year, reflecting elevated lapse as customers updated their cancer and medical coverage with our latest cancer and medical products. Our expense ratio in Japan was 19.8%, down 50 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by good expense control and to some extent, by expense allowance from reinsurance transactions. For the full year, total adjusted revenues in yen were down 3.6% to ¥1.5 trillion. Net earned premiums declined 5.9% to ¥1.1 trillion, reflecting the impacts of reinsurance transactions, paid-up policies, and deferred profit liability. When excluding these three factors, net earned premiums declined an estimated 1.7%. On this same basis, we would expect net earned premiums in 2024 to decline 2.5% to 1.5% when taking into consideration the impact of reinsurance, paid-up policies, and the deferred profit liability reclassification.Adjusted net investment income increased by 4% to ¥365.6 billion as we experienced higher yields on our U.S. dollar-denominated investments and related favorable FX. This was partially offset by a transfer of assets due to reinsurance. Pretax earnings were ¥456.9 billion or 6% higher than a year ago. For 2024, we would expect our well-priced in-force to show greater stability in terms of the benefit ratio excluding unlockings and to be in the range of 66% to 68%. This is a function of both favorable morbidity experience and improved mix of business. With the current trend in revenues, we are actively reducing our expenses. We are taking both tactical efforts as well as more long-term transformational initiatives and we would expect our expense ratio to be in the range of 19% to 21% going forward.The pre-tax profit margin for Japan for 2023 was 30.5%, up 280 basis points year-over-year. A very good result. With approximately 30% of the Japan portfolio in U.S. dollar assets, the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the yen has increased the proportion of net investment income as a component of our pretax profit. With a greater contribution to profitability from net investment income in yen terms, our pre-tax margin is naturally pushed up. In addition, having transitioned to option-based currency hedging, we expect quarterly hedge costs to remain roughly in line with what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2023. In combination with a lower expected benefit ratio, we expect a pretax profit margin of 29% to 31% in 2024. Turning to Aflac U.S. Our 2023 total benefit ratio came in well below expectations at 42.8%.We estimate that the remeasurement gains impacted the benefit ratio by 500 basis points in 2023. Claims utilization has stabilized, but as we incorporate more recent experience into our reserve models, we unlocked assumptions and released reserves during the year. Persistency increased 130 basis points year-over-year to 78.6%. This is a function of poor persistency quarters falling out of the metric and stabilization across numerous product categories. Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 40.6%, up 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by our growth initiatives and higher DAC amortization. We would expect the U.S. expense ratio to decrease over time as these businesses grow to scale and improve their profitability. For the full year, total adjusted revenues were up 2.1% to $6.6 billion.Net earned premiums increased 1.9% to $5.7 billion in 2023. Adjusted net investment income increased 8.6% to $820 million, mainly driven by higher yields on both our fixed and floating-rate portfolios. Pretax earnings were $1.5 billion or 10.4% higher than a year ago, driven primarily by the lower benefit ratio which was largely impacted by the third quarter unlock and only partially offset by the higher expense ratio. For 2024, we would expect net earned premium growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%. Profitability for the U.S. segment was solid with a pretax margin of 22.7%, driven primarily by the remeasurement gains from unlocking. Looking forward at 2024, as we grow products with a higher benefit ratio and lower expense ratio, like group life and disability, and network dental and vision, you should start to see those changes reflected in our ratios over time.In 2024, we would expect to operate with a benefit ratio in the range of 45% to 47% and an expense ratio of 38% to 40%. This translates into an expected profit margin of 19% to 21%. In our corporate segment, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $425 million, compared to a loss of $218 million a year ago, primarily due to higher investment tax credits and the impact of the innovation of our reinsurance treaty with a third party. Adjusted net investment income was $54 million lower than last year due to an increased volume of tax credit investments. Higher rates began to earn in and amortized hedge income increased. These tax credit investments impacted the corporate net investment income line for U.S. GAAP purposes negatively by $343 million with an associated credit to the tax line.The net impact to our bottom line was a positive $39 million. To date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations. The impact from the reinsurance innovation was a one-time negative of $151 million. Overall, we're very pleased with our 2023 results and our outlook for 2024. I'll now turn the call back to David, so we can begin Q&A. David?David Young: Thank you, Max.

The level of concurrent third sector sales remains above 50%. Given Japan's demographics, our product strategy is to fit the needs of the customers at any stage in life. Acquiring younger customers is critical to our success along with our intense focus on being where the customer wants to buy insurance. We have a broad network of distribution channels including agencies, alliance partners and banks. This reach continually optimizes opportunities to help provide financial protection to the Japanese consumers.We are working hard to support each channel. While the market presents challenges, we expect to reach JPY 67 billion to JPY 73 billion of sales in Japan by the end of 2026.Turning to the U.S. We also generated strong overall financial results in 2023. Total adjusted revenues increased 2.1% to $6.6 billion. The decline in total net benefits and claims was slightly offset by the increase in adjusted expenses.Pretax adjusted earnings increased 10.4% to an all-time high of $1.5 billion for the year.

As you know, we've been focused on increasing persistency to grow profitable earned premium. In addition, we continually evaluate new business to ensure that it is profitable.During the fourth quarter, we made some tactical decisions to avoid sales opportunities to certain less profitable larger accounts like those of high turnover. At the same time, we focused on updating our products to ensure that our policyholders continue to realize the value of our products provide.As part of our efforts, we introduced our new cancer protection insurance policy in the second quarter of 2023. Since that time, our cancer insurance have increased nearly 25%. We know that when people experience the value of our products, it increases persistency, which benefits our policyholders and lower our expenses.

We estimate the impact from remeasurement gains to be 130 basis points favorable to the benefit ratio in 2023.Long-term experience trends, as it relates to treatment of cancer and hospitalization have continued to lead to favorable underwriting experience. Persistency remained solid with a rate of 93.4% and was down 70 basis points year-over-year, reflecting elevated lapse as customers updated their cancer and medical coverage with our latest cancer and medical products.Our expense ratio in Japan was 19.8%, down 50 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by good expense control and to some extent, by expense allowance from reinsurance transactions.For the full year, total adjusted revenues in yen were down 3.6% to JPY 1.5 trillion. Net earned premiums declined 5.9% to JPY 1.1 trillion, reflecting the impact of reinsurance transactions, paid up policies and deferred profit liability.When excluding these 3 factors, net earned premiums declined an estimated 1.7%. On this same basis, we would expect net earned premiums in 2024 to decline 2.5% to 1.5%. When taking into consideration, the impact of reinsurance, paid-up policies and the deferred profit liability reclassification.Adjusted net investment income increased 4% to JPY 365.6 billion, as we experienced higher yields on our U.S. dollar-denominated investments and related favorable FX. This was partially offset by transfer of assets due to reinsurance. Pretax earnings were JPY 456.9 billion or 6% higher than a year ago.For 2024, we would expect our well-priced in-force to show greater stability in terms of the benefit ratio, excluding unlockings and to be in the range of 66% to 68%. This is a function of both favorable morbidity experience and improved mix of business.With the current trend in revenues, we're actively reducing our expenses. We are taking both tactical efforts as well as more long-term transformational initiatives, and we would expect our expense ratio to be in the range of 19% to 21% going forward.The pretax profit margin for Japan for 2023 was 30.5%, up 280 basis points year-over-year, a very good result. With approximately 30% of the Japan portfolio in U.S. dollar assets, the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the yen has increased the proportion of net investment income as a component of our pretax profit. With a greater contribution to profitability from net investment income in yen terms, our pretax margin is naturally pushed up. In addition, having transitioned to option-based currency hedging, we expect quarterly hedge costs to remain roughly in line with what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2023. In combination with a lower expected benefit ratio, we expect a pretax profit margin of 29% to 31% in 2024.Turning to Aflac U.S. Our 2023 total benefit ratio came in well below expectations at 42.8%. We estimate that the remeasurement gains impacted the benefit ratio by 500 basis points in 2023. Claims utilization has stabilized. But as we incorporate more recent experience into our reserve models, we unlocked assumptions and released reserves during the year.Persistency increased 130 basis points year-over-year to 78.6%. This is a function of poor persistency quarters following out of the metric and stabilization across numerous product categories.Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 40.6%, up 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by our growth initiatives and higher DAC amortization. We would expect the U.S. expense ratio to decrease over time as these businesses grow to scale and improve their profitability.For the full year, total adjusted revenues were up 2.1% to $6.6 billion. Net earned premiums increased 1.9% to $5.7 billion in 2023. Adjusted net investment income increased 8.6% to $820 million, mainly driven by higher yields on both our fixed and floating rate portfolios.Pretax earnings were $1.5 billion or 10.4% higher than a year ago, driven primarily by the lower benefit ratio, which was largely impacted by the third quarter unlock and only partially offset by the higher expense ratio.For 2024, we would expect net earned premium growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%.Profitability for the U.S. segment was solid, with a pretax margin of 22.7%, driven primarily by the remeasurement gains from unlocking.Looking forward at 2024, as we grow products with a higher benefit ratio and lower expense ratio, like group life and disability and network dental and vision, you should start to see those changes reflected in our ratios over time. In 2024, we would expect to operate with a benefit ratio in the range of 45% to 47%, and an expense ratio of 38% to 40%. This translates into an expected profit margin of 19% to 21%.In our Corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $425 million, compared to a loss of $218 million a year ago, primarily due to higher investment tax credits and the impact of the innovation of our reinsurance treaty with a third party.Adjusted net investment income was $54 million lower than last year due to an increased volume of tax credit investments. Higher rates began to earn in and amortized hedge income increased. This tax credit investments impacted the corporate net investment income line for U.S. GAAP purposes negatively by $343 million, with an associated credit to the tax line.The net impact to our bottom line was a positive $39 million. To date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations. The impact from the reinsurance innovation was a onetime negative of $151 million.Overall, we are very pleased with our 2023 results and our outlook for 2024. I'll now turn the call back to David, so we can begin Q&A. David?David YoungThank you, Max. (Operator Instructions) Betsy, we will now take the first question.Operator(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.Thomas George GallagherOne numbers question and then one on strategy.Just the numbers question. I guess for the last several years, you've had better portfolio yield in Japan being driven by to pivot into USD portfolio. If I look at the last couple of quarters, that seems to be flattening out. So your portfolio yield has been more stable. Can you talk about what's driving that and what it means for 2024 NII in Japan? And then, Dan, strategy question is, just given the growth headwinds in Japan, would you guys consider anything more meaningful on M&A strategically to help facilitate growth? I know you haven't really done this in the past, but there does seem to be an element of kind of unavoidable demographic headwind in Japan that you're fighting against here. So curious what you think on strategy there.Max Kristian BrodenI'll kick it off and then hand over to Brad and then to Dan for the strategy question.As it relates to our investment portfolio and net investment income, you're correct in noticing that our net investment income has increased over the last couple of years. A portion of that is driven by our increased allocation to U.S. dollar assets. And I do want to remind you that, that is primarily driven by the view that we have of hedging our economic exposure to the yen as it relates to the overall exposure that we have as a company to the yen throughout like Japan.We have now reached what we view to be more of a steady state as it relates to our total U.S. dollar allocation. So from that level, I would expect a stabilization in terms of our total allocation between yen and dollars within the investment portfolio.But as it relates to more of an outlook into 2024 for our NII, I'll turn to Brad and he can give you some more color.Bradley Eugene DyslinYes. The only thing I would add is just to remind you that our new money yield is both a blend of lower yen rates as well as the higher U.S. dollar rates. Most of our deployment is planned for U.S. dollar assets and that is to maintain the balances, as Max just described. But we do still like yen spread products when we can locate acceptable outlets. When that happens, then we will put them in the portfolio and that does result in pulling down the overall reported new money yield just because of the simple math of lower yen rates.Daniel Paul AmosAnd Tom, in regards to strategy, that's been an issue we've had for several years. We feel like that one of the things we are addressing (technical difficulty) cancer or medical product to it by starting them off on an inexpensive savings plan that gets them to participate with us.We also continue to look for new product. We have still not found that third product or third leg that we want to find. And we're continuing to try things.But I don't know of anyone right now that I would trade places within Japan in terms of distribution and product that we have and believe we can continue to grow our business moving forward. Saying that, we have to be realistic that it is an aging population and it also is a position where it's not the population is declining.But all in all, I still believe it's the best market in the country or in the world because of the persistency and our ability to continue to grow it. And so I think you're going to see growth for the next several years. We did lower that number to -- from JPY 80 billion just to be cautious, but we're encouraged.Our Japan Post growth and what's gone there continues to do very well, and we've enjoyed our relationship there. It's our existing distribution system that was really hurt, both in the U.S. and Japan, by COVID, but more so in Japan because if you look back at COVID, it really lasted an additional year in Japan. And because our agents are commission-driven, our newer agents, when COVID hit, all of a sudden did not have an opportunity to go out and sell one-on-one. And as we've always said, our products are sold, they're not bought. And so we go out and make those presentations, and we couldn't do it.And so people that were normally working for us on a commission basis tried to find other jobs that were salary in nature and that's what we've been fighting, but it is coming back both in the U.S. and Japan, and I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing there.OperatorThe next question comes from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies.Suneet Laxman L. KamathJust a couple on Japan. And the first one, Dan, just gets back to something you're just talking about in terms of the JPY 67 billion to JPY 73 billion sort of target down from the JPY 80 billion. Are you viewing that as sort of just a delay? And that, that JPY 80 billion is ultimately achievable, maybe a year beyond your original target? Just -- I wanted to think about it a little bit longer term.Daniel Paul AmosWell, I certainly think it's the potential out there. I don't know what year because the COVID with such an anomaly, what I'd like to do is to let our people that are there on the -- Koide or whoever wants to take this particular question can do it. And then I'll follow up if there's any other part you want me to directly address.Masatoshi KoideYes. This is Koide, Aflac Japan.[Interpreted] So let me answer the question.And the reason why we've changed our target from JPY 80 billion to JPY 67 billion to JPY 73 billion was because we knew that it would take a longer time. So we do think that we are able to achieve JPY 80 billion if we look beyond 2026 or after.Suneet Laxman L. KamathGot it. Okay. All right. And then I just had another question on, I guess, persistency in Japan. If I just think back to Aflac from years ago, it strikes me that part of the reason the persistency was so strong is because you sold at the work site and there just was very little job mobility in Japan so people just kept the products for a long time. And I guess the question is, as you're shifting now to new distribution channels outside of the work site and to a younger population, which seems to be the objective, should we just expect a natural decline in that persistency over time?Max Kristian BrodenI'll kick it off and I'll let anybody add some commentary to that as well. As we sell to younger customers, that should actually improve the persistency because of the age-based pricing that we have in Japan, there's a very strong incentive to hold on to the product for a long time and maybe even for life. So as you sell into a younger population, that tends to reduce your lapse rates and improve your persistency.Suneet, you are correct to -- when you look at the corporate agencies that you are referring to from the past that, that was -- had very strong persistency overall in that channel. And as that has become a smaller piece of our overall inforce, that have structurally reduced our persistency.The other thing I would mention as well is that we have seen an aging of the block. And when you have an aging of the block, that naturally leads to higher lapsation and lower persistency as well. So you hear us talk about that we are trying to reach younger customers, that is partially to sort of fight these sort of long-term trends that we have going on in our inforce block to not only provide coverage and new coverages to the younger population, but also to improve the overall persistency of the block.All of this is marginal from year-to-year, and it's very slow moving, but it's certainly something that we're watching closely.Daniel Paul AmosYoshizumi, do you have any comments you'd like to add? Our head of sales in Japan.Koichiro Yoshizumi[Interpreted] This is Yoshizumi. And regarding the persistency that was just asked and answered by Max, and as Max answered, by us focusing on young and middle-aged customers, our persistency is going to be higher, and that is our strategy. And that is actually represented by the medical insurance that was just launched on September 19.And this product is very popular among the young and middle-aged customers whose ages are under 49 or 49 and under.In terms of the number of policy count that we sold to these young and middle-aged customers, we actually saw a 46% increase year-on-year from the time that we launched in September to the end of the year last year. And these customers are for our middle and long-term growth of Aflac Japan, and these are the customers who will be our assets and our treasure going forward.And the actual premiums that are being paid by young and middle-aged customers are lower. And we truly believe that by focusing on these younger customers and increasing these young customers would contribute to stable growth of our company. And at the same time, as I mentioned, the persistency rate will be higher and this is our strategy.Daniel Paul AmosI just want to remind you all that the persistency rate is really high. And we can move it up a little bit, move down a little bit, but it is more than we ever dreamed when we first started doing business over there. So we're very pleased with it. So -- but at the same time, we will improve because when you're writing younger people, of course, they'll live longer, and therefore, will be more persistent.OperatorThe next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.Jamminder Singh BhullarSo first, a question on Japan. And if you think really long term, is it even realistic to assume that the business can grow given that the population shrinking, the population is aging as well? And then versus 10, 20 years ago, there are a lot more companies in the product lines that you're in? So if you could just comment on that, like -- and maybe on your -- the reduction in guidance on sales, how much of that has to do with just Japan taking longer to recover from COVID versus some of these demographic headwinds?Daniel Paul AmosWell, my first comment is, you're correct in terms of a competitive environment. But what is in Japan or any other country that isn't competitive. So being competitive is nothing new to us, and something that we are understanding that we have to constantly look for ways to address how we can identify with consumers and show the need for our products even more.Now don't forget, we've seen copays and deductibles over many years. I don't know when another one will take place or what will happen. But as inflation, even though small in Japan, you have to take that into account, too. So remember, our ability to convert and add more premium to existing policyholders always makes a difference and grows our block of business as well, and we especially think that with the younger people. Let me now turn to Japan and let them comment on it.Masatoshi KoideYes. This is Koide, Aflac Japan.[Interpreted] And it is true that Japan is being projected as having declining population. But at the same time, with the advancement of longevity in the 100-year life era, the need to prepare for longevity risk is expected to increase steadily.And it's also expected that the aging population could increase the medical cost because as you live long, the probability of suffering from cancer and other diseases will increase.And in Japan, the sustainability of the overall social security system is being discussed. And this would also include medical and nursing care. And this is being questioned, and the discussions are underway within the Japanese government to review how the benefits and burden should be balanced.And given these circumstances, there is a way of thinking about helping themselves or self-help and preparing for the future as people become more aware of the situation. And as a result, although the population may decline, we do think that the third sector market will steadily grow going forward as well.Jamminder Singh BhullarOkay. And then on the U.S. business, do you have a better clarity on the tri-agency rule and its potential impact on your sales?Virgil Raynard MillerThis is Virgil, good morning from the U.S. We have been working with the tri-agency sales to talk about any potential impact we could see to those selling supplemental into the consumers out there. And we're waiting on a ruling. Thus far, they set a date to be on April 2024, you know and I know that a date may move. However, we remain encouraged that our policies and coverages are relevant regardless if that rule does come through.We looked at our (inaudible) sales from last year. We really didn't see any decline. We remain flat there. And again, regardless, even if there is a rule or not a rule, our coverage is relevant and we're not predicting any major impact going forward.OperatorThe next question comes from Wilma Burdis with Raymond James.Wilma Carter Jackson BurdisCould you talk a little bit about the outlook for capital generation, and if we should expect anything on an ongoing basis from internal reinsurance opportunities?Max Kristian BrodenWilma, if you think about the total capital generation that we've had recently and also going into 2024, I don't see any significant change to our overall capital generation on an organic basis. That remains in the $2.6 billion to $3 billion range. On top of that, we know that we have opportunities that we can overtime unlock more capital through utilizing our reinsurance platform, and we intend to do so. We can't necessarily predict exactly when that will happen or what amounts that will be, but you've seen us in the recent past be quite active on that front. So I would expect us to do more. But on a pure, sort of run rate organic basis, I would have pegged our underlying capital generation at $2.6 billion to $3 billion annually.Wilma Carter Jackson BurdisAnd could you just talk more about the commercial real estate watch list? It's higher than a lot of the peers, and you guys have taken the key back on a few properties lately. So if you could go into that and what you're seeing there?Unidentified Company RepresentativeSure. I think there's one primary thing related to our watch list relative to our portfolio that makes us different than peers, and that's the fact that the bulk of our exposure is in transitional real estate. Remember, that's a much shorter asset class. It's a much shorter maturity, generally a 3-year term with some options to extend out a fourth and fifth year.So because of that, when you have a market downturn and you've got these maturities coming due and the liquidity is as poor as we're seeing in the market today, it naturally creates an elevated watch list and creates an elevated amount of potential foreclosures. Now, we work very closely with our borrowers to address those maturities. We do our best to avoid foreclosure. But if they are not willing to work with us, if they're not willing to reset the loan to reflect current valuations and give us other protections, we are fortunate that we're in a position we can and will foreclose if we think that's the best route to maximize our recoveries. We are blessed with a strong capital and liquidity position, which prevents us from being a forced seller here. So I think it's a combination of the nature of our portfolio, having shorter maturities relative to our total exposure. And then the fact that we are much more willing to foreclose and able to foreclose, if we think that's the best route.OperatorThe next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.Elyse Beth GreenspanMy first question, going back to just Japan sales guidance. Dan, I know you said you guys are being cautious in lowering the outlook there. But how do we think about -- how should we think about going from the JPY 60.7 billion of sales in '23 to the new JPY 67 billion to JPY 73 billion target? Should we think about that being even -- even over the next few years or maybe a bit more back-ended?Daniel Paul AmosJapan? Okay. Well, we at this particular time are just evaluating what we think might happen for the next 2 years. And frankly, we've just tried to be conservative and give us some latitude on what would happen. But we have some very positive things coming out in 2024 that we think will drive sales and are encouraged about it and even some things as we're looking to 2025 that will be coming.Let me make sure that Koide or -- they don't want to make any comments in that regard. Koide?Koichiro YoshizumiYes. This is Yoshizumi.Daniel Paul AmosOkay, Yoshizumi.Koichiro Yoshizumi[Interpreted] Okay. Let me answer the question.And as Dan mentioned earlier, it is true that COVID has impacted Japan way beyond our expectation. And as a result, the number of solicitors or sales agents have decreased significantly. And even if you were -- even if our agencies are able to hire the sales agents, we were not able to train them.It was not until May last year in Japan that COVID has been reclassified at the same level as with influenza. So we had no choice, but faced really truly difficult situation in sales for a long time. And at the same time, it is also true that it took us quite a bit of time to train those sales agents that have lower skill. But right now, what we are very much focused on is to really recruit and train that the solicitors or sales agents. Otherwise, we will not be able to train and grow those sales agents that are customer-centric.Aflac sales agents must be those agents that are very welcomed by our customers. What I mean by that is that those sales agents must respond to customers' needs when they solicit policies, but at the same time, when the benefits and claims are paid. And I do believe that it is Aflac's mission to send out these kind of sales agents to the market appropriately. And that is the reason why we have set our sales target relatively conservative. And we currently do have recruiting and development and training plan for our future, as Koide mentioned earlier, beyond maybe JPY 80 billion or even more in the future.Max Kristian BrodenElyse, I would think about the sales trajectory as being relatively linear, i.e., not back-end loaded.Elyse Beth GreenspanThat's helpful, Max. And then my second question, you guys you pointed out, you obviously have a good amount of buffer at the holdco relative to where you've talked about running. How do you think about, I guess, managing that down? And how should we think about the level of potential buybacks in '24?Max Kristian BrodenSo we're obviously operating with a very significant capital levels in all of our subsidiaries at the moment. Over time, I would expect us to operate at slightly lower capital levels in terms of the ratios than where we are today.I would reflect that in Japan, we are now going through a transition from SMR to ESR. So I wouldn't necessarily make any dramatic changes ahead of that. In the U.S., we are looking to, over time, target in an RBC of closer to 400%, and we have active plans towards drawing that down.At the same time, we have strong capital and liquidity at the holding companies. We always think about where is capital serving us the best at that very point in time, at the same time, making sure that we have capital available for deployment into dividends, buybacks, et cetera. So overall, I would say that our capital plans remain solid. We've got plenty of capital around, and we try to place it where it makes the best use.OperatorYour next question comes from John B. Barnidge from Piper Sandler.John Bakewell BarnidgeI had a question of going back to the Japan sales target. I know you put out a press release in December about the Trupanion pet insurance partnership for Japan. Did that pivot remove any sales contribution from the JPY 80 billion assumption? And can you talk...Daniel Paul AmosNo, it did not.John Bakewell BarnidgeOkay. Then can you maybe talk about the growth opportunity for that product in the U.S. that was called out in the pivot and commitment to ownership stake?Max Kristian BrodenPet insurance, we think, has a significant opportunity in the U.S. market because of the very low penetration of the product itself.For Aflac, we act as a distributor where these premiums, claims, et cetera, do not hit our income statement. So it's an opportunity to -- for our distribution to earn additional commissions, so in that sense, it's very positive to Aflac.We do, obviously, have an alliance and a partnership with Trupanion that is strong through the equity ownership that we have in the company, and we capture significant economics over time through that equity ownership.OperatorYour next question comes from Joel Hurwitz with Dowling & Partners.Joel HurwitzFirst, a question on U.S. expenses. So the outlook looks to be largely in line with prior year. You've talked in the past on bending the expense curve and getting closer to a mid-30% expense ratio. Can you just provide an update on those expectations and when we should start to see a more significant drop in the expense ratio in the U.S.?Max Kristian BrodenSo you are starting to see a drop in 2024, and I would expect that to continue. There are 2 forces at play here, both expenses and our revenues. Expenses, we have active plans to improve our expense efficiency and reduce expenses, both from a tactical and transformational standpoint. But also do not disregard the impact from revenues here. So as we have a number of businesses that are not at scale today, they will grow to scale. And when they do that, their expense ratios will drop significantly, and that will improve overall our expense ratio, i.e., push that down.The last piece to all of this is also where is our future growth coming from. It is generally coming from low expense ratio businesses. Predominantly, the group life and disability business that operates at a significantly lower structural expense ratio than the voluntary benefits business.So if you take all of that together, we should have a trajectory that is going lower and we would expect to operate in the 35% to 37% over time.Joel HurwitzOkay. Makes sense. And then just on the recapture. Any color on the economic benefit? And then are there other blocks that you could potentially execute something similar on?Max Kristian BrodenSo overall, we're very pleased with the economics. The -- in terms of the impact on future run rate results, they're relatively small, but they're obviously favorable. So there's a favorable run rate going forward. In terms of the other blocks out there, I do deem that this is -- was the one that we really had out there. I wish we had more than we could do, but this was really the one that we had outstanding.OperatorThe next question comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW.Ryan Joel KruegerFirst, I just wanted to follow up on the U.S. expense ratio, given that the group products also tend to have higher benefit ratio. So just curious, as you continue -- as you do grow those business lines and the expense ratio comes down, would you expect, ultimately, for the margins in the U.S. is to increase? Or to what extent would that be offset by naturally higher benefit ratios on those products?Max Kristian BrodenSo I think that we have been in a structurally low benefit ratio period, which means that over time, I would expect our benefit ratios to increase. And you're right, Ryan, to acknowledge that the mix impact will also push our benefit ratios higher. So we're always going to see that mix impact, impacting both expense ratio and benefit ratios going forward. And that will have a slightly negative impact to the pretax margin going forward because of mix.I'll kick it over to Virgil Miller to give his comments as well.Virgil Raynard MillerSo first, we're not pleased where we sit with the expense ratio. That is absolutely a focus for the U.S. And one of the things we're doing is making sure we have plans that are going to continue to be in that curve, and you'll see that happening over a period of time. And we're basically challenging all of the U.S. leadership to be accountable for that, and it is tied to our little compensation. Now I'll go step further, though, I mentioned that when we talked about the actual sales growth this year, one of the things we mentioned -- you heard Dan mention earlier, is our strong underwriting discipline. We are making sure that we only put policies and business on the books that actually have better persistency and lower turnover rates with employees.So the underwriting discipline itself will continue to help drive and bend that expense curve and drive up that benefit ratio, along with, as Max mentioned, the continued growth that we're seeing on (inaudible), it would change the overall business mix in the U.S. So just to conclude, it is absolutely a focus for us and that we are confident we've got the right plans in place to start bidding that curve starting next year.Ryan Joel KruegerAnd then on Japan internal reinsurance, you've done a transaction 2 years in a row. Is there any practical limitation on doing something like that kind of pretty regularly? Or is there anything that would commit your ability to do that?Max Kristian BrodenSo Ryan, over time, we would expect that we could see at about 10% of the Aflac Japan balance sheet to Aflac Bermuda. There are no real legal limitations to it, but at the same time, we got to acknowledge any sort of risks associated with internal reinsurance to make sure that we don't overexpose ourselves or we make sure that we can handle everything associated with it. So over time, I would expect us to see something like 10%. And to date, we have done about 4%.Virgil Raynard MillerAnd this is Virgil. Let me just go back to add, when I was talking about being on that curve, that starts this year, in 2024. I just want to make sure you got that. I said next year, but I mean 2024.OperatorThe next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.Joshua David ShankerJust a question as to whether or not the yen at JPY 140, JPY 150 to the dollar versus [110], does that change your hedging costs, your desire to hedge the strategy at all in your investment portfolio?Unidentified Company RepresentativeSo obviously, the pricing of options will move and that impacts to some extent, the cost of hedging. And so obviously, every input that you would have to the pricing of options would impact that. In terms of the level of the yen, the answer is no. We want to structurally protect the economic exposure we have to the yen. And we do that through the dollar allocation that we have in the general account. We do that through the debt that we issue in yen, and we do that through the forwards that we hold at the holding company, where we are long dollars, short yen. So overall, we do this in order to reduce risk, not necessarily to express an opinion on the yen. Now, how we hedge and protect ourselves, we have all these different levers that we can pull, and the cost and return on capital associated with those can vary over time because of the capital markets. So that's why we will then dial up and dial down some of those associated with that. But it's not necessarily associated with the level of the yen-dollar rate. We are not FX traders. We're looking to protect ourselves long term.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Young for any closing remarks.David YoungThank you, Betsy, and thank you all for joining us this morning. If you have any additional questions, please reach out to the Investor and Rating Agency Relations team. We will be happy to talk to you then, and we look forward to speaking to you soon. Have a great day.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

New Gold (NGD) Gears Up to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-ngd-gears-post-q4-152700543.html`2024-02-08 15:27:00`New Gold NGD is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 13, after market close.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NGD’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 2 cents per share, which indicates a turnaround performance from the loss of 1 cent per share reported in the year-ago comparable quarter. Over the past 30 days, the estimate has moved down 33%.New Gold reported adjusted earnings per share of 3 cents in the third quarter of 2023 against  a loss of 2 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. NGD has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of a positive 66.7%, on average.New Gold Inc. price-eps-surprise | New Gold Inc. QuoteNew Gold recently provided fourth-quarter 2023 production update, which indicates how the company is likely to fare in the to-be-reported quarter.NGD reported consolidated gold equivalent production of 105,082 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2023, which marked a 7% increase year over year. The figure included 79,187 ounces of gold, 12.0 million pounds of copper and 157,788 ounces of silver. The New Afton mine delivered a strong quarter with a 53% year-over-year improvement in gold equivalent production as a result of higher tons processed, higher gold and copper grades and higher recovery rates.The company sold 103,504 gold equivalent ounces in the quarter under review, up 9% from the year-ago quarter’s sales of 95,161 ounces. While gold sales dipped 1% to 77,870 ounces, copper sales improved 75% year over year to 11.9 million pounds.In the fourth quarter of 2022, average realized gold prices were $1,751 per ounce and average realized copper prices were $3.74 per pound. With both prices for gold and copper trending higher than these levels in the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect this to have benefited the company’s top-line results. Also, higher copper volumes, somewhat offset by the 1% dip in gold volumes, are also likely to have reflected in the performance.However, operating expenses are likely to have been higher on a year-over-year basis due to increased production in the quarter. Nevertheless, the expected improvement in revenues is expected to have offset this impact on the company’s fourth-quarter 2023 earnings.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for New Gold this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for New Gold is -25%.Zacks Rank: NGD currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Shares of New Gold have gained 23.5% over the past year against the industry’s 5.5% decline.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere are some companies in the basic materials space, which according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Eldorado Gold EGO, scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2023 earnings on Feb 22, currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.53% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/agnico-eagle-mines-aem-reports-150052484.html`2024-02-08 15:00:52`The market expects Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis gold mining company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.2%.Revenues are expected to be $1.52 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12.79% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Agnico?For Agnico, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.14%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Agnico will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Agnico would post earnings of $0.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.44, delivering a surprise of +2.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Agnico appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerKinross Gold (KGC), another stock in the Zacks Mining - Gold industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.09 for the quarter ended December 2023. This estimate points to no change from the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $902.17 million, down 16.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Kinross Gold has been revised 23.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 13.51%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Kinross Gold will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

4 Mining Stocks Poised to Outshine Q4 Earnings Estimates`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-mining-stocks-poised-outshine-120000716.html`2024-02-08 12:00:00`The mining industry is housed within the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. The Q4 earnings picture for this sector looks glum. Basic Materials is among the Zacks sectors that are expected to see the biggest decline in earnings in the fourth quarter. Overall earnings for the space are projected to fall 25.7% on 7.7% lower revenues, per the latest Earnings Trends report.Mining companies’ fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect the benefits of higher prices and efforts to boost operating efficiency and reduce costs. We have handpicked a few mining companies, Eldorado Gold Corporation EGO, Hudbay Minerals Inc. HBM, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM and Kinross Gold Corporation KGC, which are set to beat earnings estimates this earnings season.Among precious metals, gold was a stand-out performer last year. Notably, 2023 was a banner year for the yellow metal, with prices hitting an all-time high in early December, surpassing $2,100 per ounce for the first time on expectations of U.S. monetary policy easing and a weak U.S. dollar. Prices were also supported by the Israel-Hamas conflict, which boosted the demand for safe-haven assets.The bullion had a solid start to the fourth quarter on the back of strong safe-haven buying due to geopolitical tensions in Israel. Prices of the yellow metal eventually racked up a solid gain of roughly 11% for the December quarter. Notably, gold prices gained 15% in 2023 to close at $2,078 per ounce, the highest annual close on record, with demand from the central bank and heightened geopolitical risks being significant contributors to the annual performance, per the World Gold Council.  Meanwhile, copper had started 2023 on a strong note, fueled by investor expectations of a surge in demand after the reopening of China’s economy from COVID-led restrictions. However, softer demand from China and global economic concerns weighed on prices of the major industrial metal during the second quarter.Copper started the third quarter on a positive note amid expectations that demand in China will improve, backed by stimulus measures from the government, but closed the quarter lower on worries over the country’s real estate sector. However, prices of the red metal moved higher in the fourth quarter and hit a three-month high in early December on supply disruptions (partly due to the Panama copper mine closure), better-than-expected data from China, a weaker dollar and prospects of interest rate cuts. Copper maintained the momentum through December and ended the year on a high note amid concerns over supply constraints.Higher prices are expected to have supported the performances of miners in the fourth quarter. On the flip side, higher mining costs, triggered by inflationary pressure on all aspects of input costs, particularly labor, fuel and electricity, are likely to have been a drag. Nevertheless, miners remain committed to whittling down operational costs and capital spending, improving operating efficiency within existing mines, paying down debt, eliminating non-core assets and concentrating on their highest ore-grade assets. Some of these companies have also taken steps to bring down their all-in sustaining costs — the most important cost metric of miners. These actions are expected to support their margins in Q4.Given the large number of players operating in the mining space, picking the right stocks is apparently not an easy task. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One can trim the list with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Zacks Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they report with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP — the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate — is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have high chances of delivering earnings surprises in their next announcements. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as much as 70%.Below we list four mining stocks that have the right combination of elements to pull off positive surprises this earnings season:Eldorado Gold has an Earnings ESP of +3.53% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to report on Feb 22.Eldorado Gold surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, at an average of roughly 495.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EGO’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 21 cents. The company’s performance is expected to have been aided by strong gold production across the Lamaque Complex, Kisladag and Efemcukuru. It recently reported record fourth-quarter preliminary production from the Lamaque Complex on higher grade and mill throughput. Production also increased at Kisladag benefiting from the improved material handling systems. Record throughput rates were also registered at Efemcukuru in the fourth quarter.  Eldorado Gold Corporation price-eps-surprise | Eldorado Gold Corporation QuoteHudbay Minerals has an Earnings ESP of +16.26% and a Zacks Rank #3. It is slated to report on Feb 23. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings for HBM stands at 16 cents. The company is expected to have benefited from continued strong performance in its Peru operations on higher grades at the Pampacancha pit, leading to increased copper and gold production. HBM is also likely to have witnessed continued improvement in Peru’s cash cost per pound of copper in the fourth quarter. Production at Manitoba operations is also expected to have been driven by the mining of higher gold and copper grade zones at Lalor.  HudBay Minerals Inc price-eps-surprise | HudBay Minerals Inc QuoteAgnico Eagle has an Earnings ESP of +6.14% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. It is slated to report on Feb 15.Agnico Eagle surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, at an average of roughly 9.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings stands at 46 cents. AEM’s fourth-quarter results are likely to have been supported by higher realized gold prices. Its gold production is expected to have been driven by the production from the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the Canadian Malartic complex.  Agnico Eagle Mines Limited price-eps-surprise | Agnico Eagle Mines Limited QuoteKinross Gold has an Earnings ESP of +13.51% and a Zacks Rank #3. It is slated to report on Feb 14.Kinross surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, at an average of roughly 40.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings stands at 9 cents. KGC is expected to have gained from higher average realized gold prices. Tasiast and La Coipa mines are expected to have continued their strong production performance, offsetting lower expected production from Paracatu due to mine sequencing.  Kinross Gold Corporation price-eps-surprise | Kinross Gold Corporation Quote Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Agnico Eagle Mines, Eldorado Gold, Equinox Gold and Kinross Gold`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-agnico-110000371.html`2024-02-07 11:00:00`Chicago, IL – February 7, 2024 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Agnico Eagle Mines AEM, Eldorado Gold EGO, Equinox Gold EQX and Kinross Gold KGC.Industry: Gold MiningLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2221937/4-gold-stocks-to-watch-in-a-lackluster-industryGold prices ended 2023 on a solid note. However, the commodity is currently facing headwinds from a strengthening U.S. dollar. The recent slew of U.S. economic data and remarks from the Federal Reserve officials have quelled expectations of interest rate cuts. The recent dip in gold prices, combined with inflated production costs, cloud the near-term outlook for the Zacks Mining - Gold industry.Amid this uncertainty, Agnico Eagle Mines, Eldorado Gold, Equinox Gold and Kinross Gold are well-poised for growth, backed by their strong balance sheets, efforts to lower costs and growth initiatives.The Zacks Mining - Gold industry mainly comprises companies engaged in extracting gold from mines. The mines may either be underground or open pits. Mining is a long and complex process, and requires significant financial resources. It involves exploration to evaluate a deposit's size; assessing ways to extract and process ore efficiently, safely and responsibly; and developing the mine before the actual mining process.It normally takes 10-20 years for a gold mine to produce material that can finally be refined. Players in the industry nowadays use a range of sophisticated techniques to extract gold and convert it into dore bars, an alloy of gold and silver, alongside other impurities. These are then sent for purification, after which gold is purchased as bars or coins, or used in jewelry or other purposes.Gold Prices Losing Steam: Gold ended 2023 at $2,078.40 per ounce, delivering an annual return of 15%, outpacing commodities, bonds and the majority of stock markets. Despite being pitted against record-high interest rates, gold thrived on safe-haven demand from the banking crisis earlier in the year and the geopolitical instability.However, gold seems to have lost its footing this year and is currently at $2,026.62 an ounce. It is being weighed down by higher dollar and bond yields as stronger U.S. economic data and hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve dampened expectations of interest rate cuts. Over the past month, gold has experienced a 1.8% decrease in value.High Costs, Labor Shortage Are Worrisome: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce, causing a spike in wages. Industry players are persistently grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water, and material and supply-chain issues. Since the industry cannot control gold prices, it focuses on improving the sales volume and the operating cash flow, and lowering unit net cash costs.The industry participants are opting for alternative energy sources, such as solar or wind farms, to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies.Impending Demand and Supply Imbalance to Buoy Prices: Depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and the lack of new mines are inherent threats to the industry. Due to the scarcity of discoveries and exhaustive existing resources, miners prefer building up reserves through acquisitions rather than digging new ones that are risky and capital-intensive.On the demand side, the use of gold in energy, healthcare and technology is rising. India and China account for around 50% of consumer gold demand. Economic uncertainty is driving demand in China, whereas economic strength in India is yielding wealth-driven buying. Also, demand for physical gold is seasonally higher in the later part of the year, aided by the festival and wedding season in India.Holiday-related spending is expected to boost jewelry demand in China. The yellow metal has long been considered a safe-haven investment in financial or political uncertainty. Gold demand continues to be on the rise from central banks. Therefore, there will be an eventual demand-supply imbalance, which is likely to drive gold prices.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. The Zacks Mining - Gold Industry, which is a 39-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #189, which places it at the bottom 29% of 251 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let us take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.The Mining-Gold Industry has underperformed the S&P 500 Index, as well as the Basic Material sector, in a year. The stocks in the industry have collectively declined 8.1% compared with the broader sector’s fall of 8.1%. The S&P 500 has risen 19.2% in the same timeframe.On the basis of the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA, a commonly used multiple for valuing gold-mining companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 6.23X compared with the S&P 500’s 11.28X and the Basic Material sector’s forward 12-month EV/EBITDA of 6.58X.Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 9.26X and as low as 4.63X, the median being 6.29X.Eldorado Gold: The company recently announced that it produced 143,166 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 18% sequentially, driven by improved performances at Kisladag, Lamaque Complex and Efemcukuru. Gold production for 2023 was 485,140 ounces, within the company’s guidance of 475,000-495,000 ounces. An enhanced material handling circuit drove the improved performance at Kisladag.The Lamaque Complex delivered record gold production, both in the fourth quarter and the year, driven by increased grade and mill throughput. At Efemcukuru, record throughput rates were reported in the fourth quarter, averaging 1,500 tpd. This, along with higher gold grades helped the mine in delivering the full-year gold production as per plan. The mine’s rock storage facility has been completed, and will enable more efficient waste rock and dry stack tailing placement. Project costs and schedule are on track for its development project, Skouries, with commercial production expected to commence at the end of 2025.Eldorado Gold is based in Vancouver, Canada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2024 earnings has moved up 45% over the past 90 days. The estimate indicates year-over-year growth of 22.3%. The company has an estimated long-term earnings growth of 51.6%. EGO has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 496%, on average, and currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Equinox Gold: The company recently reported that it produced 155,000 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of 2023, delivering the best quarter in the year. This brought the total production for 2023 to 564,500 ounces, thereby achieving its guidance for the year. EQX’s Greenstone project is progressing well and is on track to pour gold in the first half of 2024. It is expected to be one of the largest gold mines in Canada, with an average annual gold production of more than 400,000 ounces over the first five years and more than five million ounces of gold produced over its initial 14-year mine life.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Vancouver, Canada-based company’s 2024 earnings has moved up 7% over the past 90 days. The consensus estimate indicates a substantial year-over-year improvement of 1,433%. EQX has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 168%, on average. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.Agnico Eagle Mines: The company’s sufficient cash flow is enabling it to maintain a strong exploration budget, primarily focused on Kittila, Canadian Malartic, LaRonde, Kirkland Lake, Hope Bay and Santa Gertrudis. With the positive ruling by the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland allowing Kittila to continue to operate at a rate of 2 million tons per annum, AEM expects 30,000 ounces of additional production from the Kittila mine for the fourth quarter of 2023.It also expects 2023 gold production to be at the upper end of the guidance between 3.24 million ounces and 3.44 million ounces. AEM continues to expand the exploration drilling of Roura Main, Sisar and Rimpi Zones to take advantage of better grades. LaRonde, Canadian Malartic and Nunavut are expected to be major drivers for cash flow generation over the next several years. A lower debt level contributes to its overall financial strength and stability. The company recently invested in Canada Nickel Company, which aligns with its strategy of early-stage project investments. This provides AEM an opportunity to establish a presence in an emerging nickel belt.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Toronto, Canada-based company’s 2024 earnings has moved up 0.4% over the past 90 days. AEM has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.91%, on average. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 and a long-term estimated earnings growth of 1%.Kinross Gold: The company reported gold production of 585,449 gold equivalent ounces in the third quarter of 2023, which marked a 10.6% year-over-year increase. Tasiast delivered a record quarterly production, and sales due to strong grades and recoveries. Paracatu and La Coipa also witnessed year-over-year growth in their quarterly outputs.Kinross has been on track to meet its production guidance of 2.1 million gold equivalent ounces (+/- 5%) and all-in-sustaining cost guidance for 2023. The company is tracking the bottom end of its 2023 production cost of sales guidance and the upper end of its capital expenditure guidance. The Tasiast 24k expansion project achieved a milestone with the completion of construction and initial commissioning. The project is expected to boost production, lower costs and lead to significant free cash flow. Manh Choh is advancing per plan and is expected to come online in the second half of 2024.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Toronto, Canada-based company’s 2024 earnings has moved up 2.4% over the past 90 days. The consensus estimate indicates year-over-year growth of 2.13%. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 40.9%, on average.

11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-gold-stocks-inflation-191042598.html`2024-02-06 19:10:42`"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation. Gold stands as one of the oldest investment assets in history, with opinions about its value varying among investors. Nevertheless, its unique role in markets as a store of value sets it apart from nearly all other assets. Acting as a safe-haven metal, gold offers a hedge against geopolitical instability and financial turbulence, providing investors with a secure asset to protect their purchasing power and guard against currency devaluation, such as that of the US dollar. Like any commodity, gold's price is influenced by the dynamics of supply and demand. However, its utility extends beyond being a mere store of value or investment. A significant portion of gold demand arises from its use in jewelry and various industrial applications, including electronics and medical devices. Consequently, fluctuations in the growth or contraction of these sectors inevitably impact the demand for gold.According to a Bloomberg report earlier in 2023, information provided by Invesco revealed a trend of global sovereign wealth funds and investors accumulating gold. Invesco's findings were based on a survey of 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks, collectively managing around $21 trillion in assets. Regarding gold, the report highlighted that ""a significant portion of central banks express apprehension about the precedent established by the US freezing of Russian reserves, with the majority (58%) concurring that this incident has heightened the attractiveness of gold."" The survey results emphasized that gold continues to serve as an inflation hedge, with a notable proportion of central banks intending to increase their gold holdings over the next three years.In addition, Netherlands-based ING Group stated in a report that the upward trend in gold prices observed in 2023 due to geopolitical tensions and uncertainties is anticipated to persist in 2024. The report notes that gold prices surged following the outbreak of conflict in Israel earlier in the year. Despite tensions easing in the Middle East, gold prices remain high. ING Group predicts that the Federal Reserve will commence reducing interest rates in May 2024, with a total expected reduction of 150 basis points throughout the year, and an additional 100 basis points in early 2025. According to ING, these rate cuts are projected to bolster gold prices in 2024.With that in mind, today we will explore some of the best gold stocks for inflation, with prominent choices including Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM).A closeup view of a large gold mine, illustrating the company's gold properties.Our MethodologyFor our list of the best gold stocks for inflation, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds and picked 11 dividend-paying gold stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

Will High Benefits and Expenses Affect AIG's Q4 Earnings?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/high-benefits-expenses-affect-aigs-172600071.html`2024-02-08 17:26:00`American International Group, Inc. AIG is set to report its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 13, after the closing bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.59 has remained stable over the past week. The estimate is indicative of a 16.9% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of $1.36 per share. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $11.6 billion, suggesting a decline of 4.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.AIG’s earnings beat estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 11.5%. This is depicted in the graph below.American International Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AIG’s previous-quarter performance first.In the last reported quarter, the leading global insurance organization’s adjusted operating earnings of $1.61 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.9% due to strong underwriting results in the Commercial Lines business of the General Insurance unit, a declining expense level and higher net investment income. However, the upside was partly offset by the continued incidence of catastrophe losses, as well as reduced sales of Variable Annuities and pension risk transfer deals in the Life and Retirement unit.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up before the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.In the fourth quarter, improved retention, new business and continued growth in the premium rate are expected to have boosted the performance of the General Insurance business. Profits from the segment are expected to have increased due to improving underwriting income and higher net investment income.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Insurance adjusted pre-tax income of $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter indicates an increase of 9% from the year-ago period, whereas our model estimate predicts nearly 8% growth.AIG still remains the majority shareholder in Corebridge (its Life and Retirement business) following the secondary offerings last year and combines its results of operations in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The consensus mark for adjusted pre-tax income for the overall Life and Retirement business is pegged at $946.8 billion, signaling a jump of nearly 11% from the prior-year quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income indicates an 8.1% increase from the year-ago period, while our model suggests 10.8% growth, thanks to improved reinvestment rates and higher alternative investment income.The factors stated above are expected to have positioned AIG for year-over-year growth in profit levels. However, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned in General Insurance indicates a nearly 2% decrease from the year-ago period. Also, the consensus mark for overall premium revenues indicates a 5.7% year-over-year decline.Looking into expenses, our model estimate for total benefits and expenses indicates around 17% year-over-year growth due to higher policyholder benefits and losses incurred, affecting profit growth levels and making an earnings beat uncertain. We also expect general operating and other expenses to have increased nearly 2% in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the combined ratio for total General Insurance is pegged at 90.7%, up from 89.9% in the year-ago period. Nevertheless, the effects of its transformative program, named AIG 200, are expected to have provided the company’s bottom line some breathing room in the quarter under review.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American International this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -0.56%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $1.58 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AIG currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.While an earnings beat looks uncertain for AIG, here are some companies from the broader Finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Primerica, Inc. PRI has an Earnings ESP of +0.28% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Primerica’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter suggests a 22.1% year-over-year jump to $4.26 per share. The estimate remained stable over the past week. The consensus mark for PRI’s revenues is pegged at $719.5 million, indicating 5.1% year-over-year growth.Trupanion, Inc. TRUP has an Earnings ESP of +25.82% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Trupanion’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter indicates a 21.7% year-over-year improvement. The estimate improved by a penny over the past week. Furthermore, TRUP beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once.Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL has an Earnings ESP of +1.24% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Arch Capital’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.94 per share, which increased by 4 cents in the past month.

Corebridge Financial (CRBG) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corebridge-financial-crbg-earnings-expected-150053333.html`2024-02-08 15:00:53`Corebridge Financial (CRBG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.5%.Revenues are expected to be $5.42 billion, up 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.18% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Corebridge?For Corebridge, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.78%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Corebridge will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Corebridge would post earnings of $1.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.05, delivering a surprise of -0.94%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Corebridge doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, American International Group (AIG), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share for the quarter ended December 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +16.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $11.6 billion, down 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for American International Group has been revised 4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.56%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American International Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Prudential shares have lost about 0.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.6%.What's Next for Prudential?While Prudential has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Prudential: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.29 on $13.76 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $13.32 on $54.13 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

American International Group (AIG) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-international-group-aig-earnings-150033701.html`2024-02-06 15:00:33`The market expects American International Group (AIG) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.9%.Revenues are expected to be $11.6 billion, down 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.66% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American International Group?For American International Group, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.56%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American International Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American International Group would post earnings of $1.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.61, delivering a surprise of +3.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American International Group doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Is Assurant (AIZ) Stock Undervalued Right Now?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/assurant-aiz-stock-undervalued-now-144011537.html`2024-02-09 14:40:11`"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company value investors might notice is Assurant (AIZ). AIZ is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is AIZ's P/B ratio of 2.05. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.66. Within the past 52 weeks, AIZ's P/B has been as high as 2.05 and as low as 1.31, with a median of 1.65.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. AIZ has a P/S ratio of 0.82. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.99.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Assurant is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, AIZ sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And good morning, everyone. 2023 was an extraordinary year for Assurant, our seventh consecutive year of profitable growth. We drove shareholder value by delivering financial outperformance, maintaining a strong capital position and generating significant momentum throughout our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA grew 21% to nearly $1.4 billion and adjusted EPS increased by 26%, both excluding reportable catastrophes. Our results were driven by the strength of our homeowners business within Global Housing, which delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 65% excluding cats. In addition, our connected living business continued to grow, supported by our strong US partnerships with mobile carriers and cable operators, and our ability to innovate and execute for our clients.Together, Lifestyle and Housing generated nearly $775 million in dividends. This allowed us to return over $350 million to shareholders, including $200 million of share repurchases. 2023 was a testament to the power and attractive financial profile of our unique and differentiated lifestyle and housing businesses. Assurant would not have been able to achieve this level of success without our talented people, including our newly refreshed management committee, further strengthening our leadership team. As we celebrate our 20th year as a public company, I am proud of the world class culture we've created, exemplified by the many recognitions Assurant has received throughout 2023. Earlier this week, JUST 100 included Assurant as part of its 2024 rankings of America's most just companies, recognizing our commitment to serving our employees, customers, communities, the environment, and our shareholders.In addition, we received recognition from Fortune as one of America's most innovative companies, and Newsweek recognized the progress we've made to incorporate sustainability into our strategy by placing us on its list of America's most responsible companies. The dedication from our employees and leadership team, who strive to achieve our vision every day, makes it possible to innovate, to better serve our clients and create value for our shareholders. We begin 2024 in a position of strength and with great momentum. Over the past two years, we've focused on further strengthening our business portfolio and driving operational excellence, while accelerating innovation. By investing in businesses where we have leadership positions, we believe we're well positioned for future success.For instance, within Global Lifestyle, we've grown our presence in specialized markets, including in the commercial equipment space, where acquisitions have contributed to new client partnerships. We've strengthened our company through active portfolio management, making decisions to exit businesses that are not core to our long term strategy. This included exiting our sharing economy offerings and international cat exposed businesses in housing, further simplifying our portfolio. We've made significant progress in driving operational excellence across Assurant with a streamline organizational structure and real estate footprint. We've implemented digital first initiatives across our operations to support our businesses and drive value for end consumers.Finally, we've accelerated innovation in a variety of ways to drive our business growth. Moving forward, technology innovation will continue to be an important driver of growth and value creation for Assurant. Our approach has driven success within our financial results, and is evident in our track record of winning new business and renewing client partnerships. This expansion of our client base is an integral part of our strategy, and creates important tailwinds as we look toward the future. Now, turning to highlights across our business segments. For 2023, Global Lifestyle earnings were relatively flat on a constant currency basis. In connected living, 2023 represented another year of growth for the business with a 3% increase in earnings.Within our US business, we drove high single-digit EBITDA growth as we continue to innovate and execute for our growing carrier and cable operator clients through our device protection programs. We strengthened critical partnerships, including Spectrum Mobile, where we provide mobile protection, trade-in and other value-added services. In addition, we expanded our trade-in programs with major OEMs by adding a large new partner, as well as renewing AT&T, where we're deploying robotics in our mobile device facilities throughout the US. We continue to make progress internationally. In Europe, we stabilized earnings by driving expense efficiencies while continuing to address ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Throughout Asia-Pacific, we're excited by our market position and our long term outlook.We're very pleased to announce a new partnership with Telstra, Australia's largest mobile operator. Our new multi-year deal will allow us to provide comprehensive products to support the end-to-end device lifecycle for Telstra's broad base of customers, including their core mobile protection program, as well as trade-in and repair capabilities. This partnership is significant as we continue to build our presence in Asia-Pacific. Turning to auto, year-over-year declines were driven by inflationary impacts on claims costs. Beginning in 2022, we took decisive action to address significant inflation that impacted the auto repair industry. For the handful of deals structures where we've been negatively impacted by underwriting results, we successfully partnered with our clients to implement meaningful rate increases, while making important changes to strengthen and enhance our claims adjudication process.Given the longer average duration of our auto service contracts, we'll earn through the full benefit of these actions over time, with improvement expected to begin in 2024. Based on the actions taken in auto and the continued growth of connected living, we feel well positioned to deliver Global Lifestyle growth in 2024. Let's move on to Global Housing. In 2023, the segment grew significantly, driving our overall enterprise performance. Growth was led by our homeowners business, which was supported by higher premiums and in-force policy growth. The business rebounded from inflation impacts on claims experienced in 2022 and also benefited from favorable prior-year reserve development. In addition to highlighting the significant earnings power of the business, our 2023 housing results demonstrated differentiated returns and strong cash flow.Excluding favorable prior-year development, our 2023 combined ratio was 83%, including $111 million of reportable cats, which was below our assumed annual cat load of $140 million. We are also very pleased to announce a new partnership in our lender-placed business. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we'll provide lender-placed insurance services to Bank of America's 1.8 million loan portfolio, further enhancing our market position and validating the competitive strength of our offerings. In renters and other, we increased earnings modestly in 2023 as our property management channel continued to expand. Written premiums in the property management channel grew nearly 20% in 2023. Along with adding new clients, we also achieved double-digit growth across 8 of our top 10 PMC clients, creating significant business momentum.Growth was supported by the continued expansion of Cover360 where we now track over 1 million residents, a nearly 45% increase over the prior year. Technology innovation also enhanced our digital customer experience, including a new digital agent leasing portal and expanded claims processing powered by machine learning. Let's turn to our 2024 enterprise outlook. We expect continued profitable growth in 2024, driven by our business momentum. While growth is expected to be lower than the significant outperformance we delivered in 2023, we expect our 2024 results will demonstrate the combined earnings power of our advantage portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA excluding cats is expected to grow mid-single-digits, with Global Lifestyle and Global Housing delivering similar growth rates for the year.Adjusted EPS growth is expected to modestly trail adjusted EBITDA growth, primarily reflecting higher annual depreciation expenses related to technology investments critical in executing our strategy. Before concluding, I'd like to introduce our recently appointed CFO, Keith Meier. Keith has been with Assurant for over 25 years and has served in leadership positions, managing P&Ls across many of Assurant's businesses. In his most recent role as Chief Operating Officer, Keith led the transformation of our technology and drove significant operational efforts to support the end customer experience. I have no doubt that Keith as our CFO will be an enabler of driving profitable growth, while allocating capital strategically. Now over to Keith to review our quarterly results and 2024 outlook in further detail.Keith Meier: Thanks, Keith. And good morning, everyone. Before reviewing the quarterly results, I'd like to share my perspectives as I'm about to wrap up my first 90 days as Assurant CFO. During my time at Assurant, I've been fortunate to have led several businesses, as well as take on a variety of other roles across the organization, including most recently leading our technology and operational teams. These experiences have provided me with deep insights into our global clients, and the understanding of what is needed to deliver a high level of business performance, always backed by strong financial expertise and discipline. As CFO, driving growth and financial performance will continue to be my priorities. I'm focused on ensuring our capital position remains strong as we create additional shareholder value and drive profitable growth through further innovation and differentiation within our product portfolio.As I look toward the future, I'm also focused on continued expense efficiencies by utilizing digital and AI technology, which also enables us to deliver better customer experiences. Lastly, I've appreciated the opportunity to meet with many of our investors, employees and clients over the last several months, and their willingness to share observations about Assurant as I began my tenure as CFO. Our discussions have enabled me to better shape my views and the path going forward. Now, let's talk about our fourth quarter financial results, which reinforced the strength of our businesses and the performance that we've seen throughout the year. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 29% to $382 million and adjusted EPS increased by 38% to $4.90, both excluding reportable catastrophes.Adjusted earnings and EPS growth were driven by year-over-year growth in both Housing and Lifestyle. Our capital position remains strong, generating $280 million of segment dividends in the fourth quarter, and ending the year with $606 million of holding company liquidity. This allowed us to return $169 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $130 million of share repurchases. Let's review the businesses, beginning with Global Lifestyle. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 12% to $205 million, led by strong earnings growth of 23% within connected living, as our US mobile protection programs continued to grow. Higher yields on invested assets also contributed to the improved fourth quarter results. Globally, our trade-in programs represent a critical component of our device lifecycle value proposition, as well as a fee-based income driver supporting the growth of our mobile business.Throughout 2023, we serviced over 25 million devices, including 7.5 million in the fourth quarter, which represented a high watermark for the year. While trade-in results were down modestly year-over-year, we saw fee income growth from higher sale prices for used devices and contributions from new US trade-in programs. Internationally, we continue to be impacted by subscriber declines in Japan, but have stabilized performance in a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. In global auto, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat, as higher claims costs from inflation were offset by higher investment income. Claims were also elevated from the expected normalization of auto ancillary products and from international clients. During the latter part of the year, we saw positive signs in US loss trends, as we began to benefit from prospective rate increases that were implemented.Turning to net earned premiums, fees and other income, Lifestyle grew by $268 million or 13%. Growth from global automotive, which increased 14%, was due to $85 million of non-run rate premium adjustments with no corresponding earnings impact, as well as prior periods sales of vehicle service contracts. Connected living's net earned premiums, fees and other income increased 12%, benefiting from contributions from new trade-in programs, higher prices on used mobile devices and modest growth in North American mobile subscribers. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect Global Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA to grow, driven by both connected living and global automotive. We expect growth in connected living to be led by the continued expansion of our US business.We expect Japan and Europe to remain generally stable throughout the year. In global auto, we expect rate actions taken over the past 18 months to drive improvement over time, beginning in 2024. Investments related to new client implementations will temper growth in 2024 for Lifestyle, but are critical levers to expand our portfolio and strengthen our business over the long term. We continue to monitor foreign exchange impacts, broader macroeconomic conditions and interest rates, which may impact the pace and timing of growth. In terms of full year net earned premiums, fees and other income, lifestyle is expected to grow mainly from our connected living business. Moving to Global Housing, 2023 was truly a strong year. We drove growth from the actions taken over the past few years to ensure rate adequacy and drive expense leverage, while benefiting from the streamlining that we undertook to simplify our portfolio.Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $186 million, which included $22 million of reportable cats. Excluding reportable cats, adjusted EBITDA increased by nearly 50% or $68 million to $208 million. Two-thirds of the increase was driven by favorable non-cat loss experience and homeowners, including a favorable year-over-year impact of $35 million related to prior-period reserve development. This was comprised of $40 million of reserve reductions in the current quarter compared to a $5 million reduction in the fourth quarter of 2022. The remainder of the adjusted EBITDA increase was from continued top line growth in homeowners from higher premiums and an increase in the number of in-force policies. Higher investment income also contributed to earnings growth.Growth was partially offset by incremental expenses to support new business and an increase to our catastrophe reinsurance premium. For renters and other, earnings were flat as growth in our property management channel was offset by softer affinity channel volumes. For the full-year 2024, we expect Global Housing adjusted EBITDA excluding reportable cats to grow, driven by continued top line momentum in homeowners. In 2023, we benefited from $54 million of favorable prior-year reserve development. Our expectation is to deliver growth in housing in 2024, overcoming the $54 million of favorable prior-year reserve development, demonstrating the strength of the housing business. As Keith discussed, we will begin onboarding 1.8 million loans from Bank of America in the first quarter.When fully onboarded, we expect the placement rate of the book to be below Assurant's current portfolio average of 1.8%, which may impact overall placement rate trends. Due to implementation expenses, we do not expect these loans to contribute significantly to adjusted EBITDA in 2024. In terms of our cat reinsurance program, we have transitioned to a single April 1 placement date beginning this year. This greatly simplifies our placement process while maintaining comprehensive coverage in the market. As this is a transition year, we placed virtually all of our 2024 program in January, with some smaller components remaining for the April placement. For our 2024 program, our program retention will increase to $150 million, aligning with a one in five year probable maximum loss or PML as we continue to optimize risk and return.This is consistent with our 2023 program. We've expanded our risk protection to align with exposure by increasing our top end limit to protect against a 1 in 265 PML event. Over the past two years, we've continued to increase our capital protection, increasing the top end of our program from a 1 in 174 PML in 2022 to a 1 in 225 PML in 2023 and now a 1 in 265 PML in 2024. Reflecting on these expected changes, we now estimate the appropriate cat load to be $155 million for 2024. Given the exit of our international property business and the better market pricing as we leverage our strong reinsurer relationships, we expect modest overall cost savings in 2024. We will provide further updates on the reinsurance program in May. Moving to corporate.The fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA loss was $30 million, a $3 million year-over-year increase, mainly due to higher employee-related expenses. For 2024, we expect the corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to approximate $105 million. Turning to capital management. As we look forward to 2024, we expect to continue to generate significant capital and focus on maintaining balance and flexibility to support business growth. For the full year, we expect our businesses to generate meaningful cash flows, approximating two thirds of segment adjusted EBITDA, including reportable cats. Cash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current macroeconomic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory requirements.We repurchased $200 million of common stock in 2023 and currently expect share repurchases to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million for 2024, which will depend on strategic M&A opportunities, market conditions, and cat activity. As you can see, we are well positioned to deliver another year of growth in 2024 through the power of the Assurant franchise. I'll now turn the call back to Keith Demmings to share his views on performance, as supported by our differentiated business model. Keith?Keith Demmings : I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss why we believe that Assurant is so attractively valued today. Assurant is a powerful differentiated business with unique advantages that have outperformed over time. Our B2B2C business model throughout lifestyle and housing is different from other insurers and service-oriented companies. Not only do we operate in unique, highly specialized and attractive markets, but we hold strong market positions and benefit from our scale. At our core, we provide specialty insurance solutions and fee-based services that are often deeply integrated with our large clients as we play an important role delivering services to their end customers. Our alignment with industry leaders and market disruptors has helped us generate significant scale within our businesses.Our competitive advantages are further strengthened by our broad set of capabilities that allow us to innovate and execute for our partners and customers, enabling us to be flexible and agile. We have compelling and unique aspects of our business model that we believe create advantages. Our low capital intensity businesses allow us to grow efficiently, while generating additional capital for deployment. This is evident through our capital efficiency and strong cash generation of $3.5 billion over the last five years. Our risk profile is attractive. Earnings volatility is lowered by the risk sharing structures within our business models, reducing the impacts of macroeconomic volatility. For example, throughout connected living and global auto, approximately two-thirds of total risk is reinsured or profit shared to our partners.Within housing, our portfolio simplification efforts have focused on exiting more capital intensive businesses, which has enhanced our risk profile. In addition, our robust catastrophe program substantially limits retained risk due to the low per occurrence retention level and high limit at the top end of the tower. Lastly, we're well positioned to adjust pricing to enable our targeted rates of return. Lender-placed is a prime example where a product has a built-in annual inflation guard feature to ensure policy pricing accounts for higher labor and materials cost, as we've seen over the last two years. In auto, most of our client deals structures share in the risk through reinsurance or profit shares. This creates close alignment between Assurant's underlying economics and our client's financial results.Given this dynamic, we have the ability to adjust rates together with our clients to account for inflation impacts in the broader market. Over the past 18 months, we've successfully worked with our clients to put through prospective rate increases on new vehicle service contracts. Financial performance is paramount for Assurant. While growth may not always be linear, we've delivered average annual earnings and EPS growth of double digits since 2019, which has generated significant cash flow. Our 2024 outlook adds to this historical growth that we've delivered. To demonstrate the strength of our business model, we thought it would be useful to show how we perform versus a broad group of insurers on an adjusted earnings basis given the available data.Please keep in mind this example is not to suggest a new peer group. We've selected the S&P 1500 P&C index to highlight our performance against a credible and broad index that includes members we're often compared to, including specialty and P&C insurers. Over the past five years, we've grown double digits and outperform the index. Our average annual adjusted earnings growth rate excluding cats of 12% is almost double the index growth rate of 7% over the same time period. Including reportable cats, we've also outpaced the market, driving 10% average annual growth versus the index growth rate of 6%. We believe that our consistent ability to demonstrate strong, profitable growth in returns with lower volatility and required capital makes Assurant attractively valued.I'm confident that we'll continue to drive long term profitable growth and create shareholder value. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.Operator: [Operator Instructions].

Akamai Technologies, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AKAM) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 37% Above Its Share Price`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/akamai-technologies-inc-nasdaq-akam-134404145.html`2024-02-10 13:44:04`"Akamai Technologies' estimated fair value is US$176 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityAkamai Technologies' US$128 share price signals that it might be 27% undervalued The US$121 analyst price target for AKAM is 31% less than our estimate of fair valueIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$854.8mUS$1.04bUS$1.29bUS$1.39bUS$1.55bUS$1.68bUS$1.78bUS$1.87bUS$1.94bUS$2.01bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.75%Est @ 6.11%Est @ 4.97%Est @ 4.16%Est @ 3.60% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$791US$893US$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$972US$932(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.8bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.0b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.3%) = US$36bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$36b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$17bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$26b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$128, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Akamai Technologies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.242. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.StrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Unveiling Akamai Technologies (AKAM) Q4 Outlook: Wall Street Estimates for Key Metrics`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unveiling-akamai-technologies-akam-q4-141523956.html`2024-02-08 14:15:23`Wall Street analysts expect Akamai Technologies (AKAM) to post quarterly earnings of $1.59 per share in its upcoming report, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 16.1%. Revenues are expected to be $997.61 million, up 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone an upward revision of 0.2% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.Before a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.While investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.In light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain Akamai Technologies metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts.Analysts expect 'Revenue- Security' to come in at $475.98 million. The estimate suggests a change of +18.9% year over year.Analysts' assessment points toward 'Revenue- Compute' reaching $131.65 million. The estimate indicates a change of +17.1% from the prior-year quarter.The consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- Delivery' will reach $390.01 million.

Akamai Technologies (AKAM) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/akamai-technologies-akam-earnings-expected-150036264.html`2024-02-06 15:00:36`Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Akamai Technologies (AKAM) reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cloud services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.1%.Revenues are expected to be $997.61 million, up 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.24% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Akamai Technologies?For Akamai Technologies, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.61%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Akamai Technologies will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Akamai Technologies would post earnings of $1.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.63, delivering a surprise of +7.95%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Akamai Technologies appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Akamai Announces Content Protector to Stop Scraping Attacks`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/akamai-announces-content-protector-stop-113100183.html`2024-02-06 11:31:00`"The first scraper-specific product tailored to the unique characteristics of scraping attacks.CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today announced the availability of Content Protector, a product that stops scraping attacks without blocking the good traffic that companies need to enhance their business.Scraper bots are a critical and often productive part of the commerce ecosystem. These bots search for new content, highlight products in comparison sites, and gather updated product information to share with customers. Unfortunately, scrapers also get used for harmful purposes such as competitive undercutting, surveillance before inventory hoarding attacks, and counterfeiting goods and websites. Scrapers also ping sites 24/7 unless stopped — so they can degrade site performance, which in turn frustrates consumers and causes them to abandon their visits. In addition, scrapers have become much more evasive and sophisticated over the past few years.Akamai Content Protector helps detect and mitigate evasive scrapers that steal content for malicious purposes. It enables improved site performance, an enhanced user experience and protection of intellectual property while facilitating significantly better detections and fewer false negatives without increasing the rate of false positives. The product is designed for companies that need to protect their reputation and revenue potential. It offers tailored detections that include:Protocol-level assessment: Protocol fingerprinting checks how visitors connect to your site to ensure they're legitimate. It evaluates how the client establishes the connection with the server at the different layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model — verifying that the parameters negotiated align with the one expected from the most common web browsers and mobile applications.Application-level assessment: Evaluates if the client can run some business logic written in JavaScript. When the client runs JavaScript, it collects the device and browser characteristics and user preferences. These various data points are compared and cross-checked against the protocol-level data to verify consistency.User interaction: Analyzes user interactions to distinguish between human and bot traffic. It assesses how users interact with devices such as touch screens, keyboards, and mouse, identifying bots through their lack of interaction or abnormal usage patterns.User behavior: Monitors visitor behavior on your website to identify unusual patterns indicative of bots.Risk classification: Provides a deterministic and actionable low-, medium-, or high-risk classification of the traffic, based on the anomalies found during the evaluation.""Content Protector is more than just a security tool; it's a business enabler,"" says Rupesh Chokshi, SVP and GM, Application Security at Akamai. ""By safeguarding your digital assets from scraping threats, it prevents competitors from undercutting your offers, enhances site performance to keep customers engaged, and protects your brand from counterfeiters. Content Protector provides direct business value to grow your digital business with confidence.""About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

How to Find Strong Computer and Technology Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strong-computer-technology-stocks-slated-140005956.html`2024-02-05 14:00:05`Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Akamai Technologies (AKAM) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.62 a share eight days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 13, 2024.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.62 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.59 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Akamai Technologies has an Earnings ESP of 1.61%.AKAM is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Microsoft (MSFT).Microsoft is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 23, 2024. MSFT's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.84 a share 78 days from its next earnings release.For Microsoft, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.80 is 1.36%.AKAM and MSFT's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The 36% return this week takes Akso Health Group's (NASDAQ:AHG) shareholders one-year gains to 271%`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/36-return-week-takes-akso-105704044.html`2024-01-31 10:57:04`Unfortunately, investing is risky - companies can and do go bankrupt. But if you pick the right business to buy shares in, you can make more than you can lose. For example, the Akso Health Group (NASDAQ:AHG) share price has soared 271% in the last 1 year. Most would be very happy with that, especially in just one year! In more good news, the share price has risen 111% in thirty days. On the other hand, longer term shareholders have had a tougher run, with the stock falling 32% in three years.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Akso Health Group Because Akso Health Group made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.Akso Health Group actually shrunk its revenue over the last year, with a reduction of 87%. So we would not have expected the share price to rise 271%. This is a good example of how buyers can push up prices even before the fundamental metrics show much growth. It's quite likely the revenue fall was already priced in, anyway.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.We're pleased to report that Akso Health Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 271% over one year. There's no doubt those recent returns are much better than the TSR loss of 13% per year over five years. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Akso Health Group is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 3 of those can't be ignored...But note: Akso Health Group may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/allstate-corporation-nyse-q4-2023-135310671.html`2024-02-09 13:53:10`The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 8, 2024The Allstate Corporation isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Allstate’s Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please be aware this call is being recorded. And now, I’d like to introduce your host for today’s program, Brent Vandermause, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Brent Vandermause: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. And welcome to Allstate’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and our strategy. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement, and forward-looking statements about Allstate’s operations. Allstate’s results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2022 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I will turn it over to Tom.Tom Wilson: Good morning. And we appreciate you taking the time and spending your efforts to explore why Allstate is an attractive investment. So I will begin with an overview of our strategy and results, and Mario and Jess, can go through the operating performance. Then we will have time for your questions at the end. Let’s begin on slide two, which depicts Allstate’s strategy to increase shareholder value. So we have two components to this strategy, increase personal Property-Liability market share and expand protection provided to customers, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. On the right-hand side, you can see the highlights for the fourth quarter. We generated net income of $1.5 billion. The strong results reflect our actions to improve auto insurance profitability and mild weather conditions, which was a welcome reprieve from the elevated level of weather related losses in the first three quarters of the year.The proactive approach to increasing bond duration also contributed to strong results with higher income from the market based portfolio. To further increase shareholder value this year, we remain focused on improving auto insurance profitability. There is more work to be done, but we are well on our way. Additional shareholder value will then be increased by increasing policies in-force across all of our businesses. The transformative growth initiatives to drive Property-Liability market share growth can be implemented in more states this year now as auto margins have been improved. We are also focusing on expanding protection offerings to Protection Services businesses, which is shown in the lower oval as Protection Plans, Identity Protection, Roadside and Arity, all have good growth prospects.As you know, we started the process to sell the Health and Benefits business and that process is proceeding on schedule. Let’s review the financial results on slide three. Revenues of $14.8 billion in the fourth quarter increased by 8.7%. That reflects a 10.7% increase in Property-Liability earned premium and that was due to rate increases in 2022 and -- mostly in 2022, and in 2023 in both the auto and homeowners’ insurances. Net investment income in the quarter was $604 million, an 8.4% increase, reflecting higher fixed-income yields and duration extension, which is partially offset by lower performance based income. The strong profitability in the quarter generated adjusted net income of $1.5 billion or $5.82 per diluted share. Annual revenues of $57 billion were up $5.7 billion or 11.1% over the prior year.Strong fourth quarter earnings resulted in positive adjusted net income for the year. Slide four summarizes the status of the four-part auto insurance profit improvement plan. Strong execution resulted in 6.7% point improvement in the combined ratio in 2023. Starting with rates. Since 2022, the Allstate brand implemented rate increases 33.3%, which included 16.4% in 2023 and 6.9% in the fourth quarter, driven by the recent approvals in California, New York and New Jersey. National General implemented rate increases of 10% in 2022 and an additional 12.8% in 2023. Looking forward, we will pursue rate increases in 10 states to improve margins and in other states to keep pace with increases in loss costs. Expense reductions were initiated in 2019 as part of the transformative growth plan to become a low cost provider of protections, being early in this effort helped offset the rapid inflation in loss costs.The underwriting expense ratio decreased 1.1 points in 2023 compared to the prior year when you exclude the large decline in advertising that was directly linked to lower profitability. Looking forward, further cost reductions will improve efficiencies and our competitive price position. Given the significant improvement in perspective, auto margins will increase advertising investment this year. In addition, we implemented underwriting actions to restrict new business, where we were not achieving target returns. We are moving some underwriting restrictions as rate adequacy is achieved. Finally, enhancing claim practices in a high inflation and increasingly litigious environment are required to deliver good customer value. This includes accelerating the settlement of injury claims and increasing in-person inspections.This program has positioned us to increase new business levels and begin to grow policies in-force in sales where acceptable margins have been restored. Now I will turn it over to Mario to discuss Property-Liability.Mario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom. Let’s start on slide five. Property-Liability earned premium increased 10.7% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by, excuse me, higher average premiums from rate increases, partially offset by a 2% decline in policies in-force. Underwriting income of $1.3 billion in the quarter improved $2.4 billion compared to the prior year quarter due to increased premiums earned, improved underlying loss experience, lower catastrophe losses and operating efficiencies. The chart on the right highlights the components of the 89.5 combined ratio in the quarter, which improved 19.6 points from the prior year quarter. The impact of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve re-estimates on the combined ratio as shown in light blue and gray materially improved compared to the prior year.Catastrophe losses of $68 million were $711 million or 6.3 points lower than prior year due to the mild weather conditions experienced in the quarter and favorable loss development from prior period events. Prior year reserve re-estimates, excluding catastrophes, were unfavorable and totaled $199 million, representing a 1.6-point adverse combined ratio impact in the quarter and a 0.9-point favorable impact compared to the prior year quarter. Approximately $148 million related to personal auto driven in part by costs related to claims in litigation and adverse development in National General. The underlying combined ratio of 86.9, improved by 12.3 points compared to the prior year quarter, due to higher average premium and the favorable influence of milder weather conditions on accident frequency.Despite the favorable results in the quarter, the full year combined ratio of 104.5 was significantly impacted by elevated catastrophe losses primarily from events in the first three quarters, resulting in a catastrophe loss ratio that was 4 points above the 10-year average from 2013 to 2022. Now let’s move to slide six to review Allstate’s auto insurance profit trends. The fourth quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 98.9 improved by 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher earned premium, lower underlying losses, lower adverse prior year reserve re-estimates and expense efficiencies. The chart shows the underlying combined ratios from 2022 and 2023 with quarterly reported figures adjusted to reflect the estimated average severity level as of year-end for each year.As you can see, the underlying combined ratio decreased each quarter in 2023, reflecting the benefits of the profit improvement plan, Tom discussed earlier. As a reminder, we continually reassess claim severity expectations as the year progresses. If the current year expected severity increases or decreases, the year-to-date impact of that change is recorded in the current quarter, despite a portion of that impact being driven by reassessment of the prior quarters. In 2023, the full year estimate of claim severity decreased in the fourth quarter. So there was a benefit from prior quarters included in reported results in the fourth quarter. When you adjust for this, the reported underlying combined ratio of 96.4, as shown in the table would be 98.2 as shown in the bar on the graph.The three preceding quarters all benefit from the adjustments, including Q3, which improved from 100.5 in the presentation shown last quarter to 99.9, reflecting the latest severity estimates. While loss cost trends remain historically elevated, the rate of increase moderated in the second half of the year, mainly in physical damage coverages. Allstate brand weighted-average major coverage severity expectations improved from 11% as of the end of the second quarter to 9% in the third quarter and now that 8% to 9% at the end of the year. As a reminder, this trend reflects our current best estimate for the year-over-year increase in average severity. Slide seven shows the impact of our profit improvement actions across the country. As shown on the left, Allstate’s brand rate increases have exceeded 33% over the last eight quarters, including larger increases in California, New York, New Jersey and Texas, reflective of the elevated loss trends in these states.These four states comprised 36% of Allstate brand auto total written premiums in the U.S. during 2023. As you know, increases were approved in California, New York and New Jersey in December. So we have yet to see this in earned premiums. The chart on the right shows states with an underlying combined ratio below 100, shown in the light and dark blue bars were 65% of the total in 2023, more than doubling from the percentage at year-end 2022. Excluding California, New York, and New Jersey, the Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 95.9 in 2023. Slide eight shows improving profitability had a negative impact on policies in-force during 2023. On the left, you can see that total Protection Auto policies in-force, decreased by 2.9% compared to prior year, as the Allstate brand decline of 6.2% more than offset a 13.3% increase at National General.Allstate brand auto policies in-force decreased due to reduced new business volumes and lower retention. National General growth of 581,000 policies in-force was mostly driven by non-standard auto insurance and to a lesser extent, the rollout of new middle-market standard and preferred auto insurance product launches for the Custom 360 products. The chart on the right shows total personal auto new issued applications for 2023 decreased 6% compared to the prior year and the accompanying drivers. Targeted profitability actions within the Allstate brand resulted in a decline in new auto issued applications of 20% compared to the prior year. The first two red bars reflect the impact of lower new business volume in California, New York and New Jersey, as well as the direct channel decline in the remainder of the country, which was most directly impacted by the reduction in marketing investment last year.Outside of the three states where profit actions significantly reduced new business, Allstate exclusive agents increased production by 6%, driven by higher productivity, showing the response of Allstate agents to the changes we have made to incent growth and the opportunity to continue to grow with our agency owners as part of transformative growth. The acquisition of National General strategically positioned Allstate to grow in the independent agent channel with new business applications, increasing 12% in 2023. National General continues to grow non-standard auto and generate higher volume from the Custom 360 product launches. Slide nine covers homeowners’ insurance results, which generated significant profits for the quarter, while full year results were impacted by elevated catastrophe losses in the first three quarters of the year.On the left you can see net written premium increased 13.3% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher average gross written premium per policy in both the National General and Allstate Brands, and a 1.1% increase in policies in-force. National General net written premium grew 19.6% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to policy in-force growth, driven by the Custom 360 offering and higher average premiums from implemented rate increases. Allstate brand net written premiums increased 12.5%, driven by average gross written premium per policy increases of 12.2% compared to the prior year quarter and a small increase in policies in-force. Allstate agents continue to bundle auto and homeowners’ insurance at historically high levels.Catastrophe losses of $21 million in the fourth quarter were low by historical standards, reflecting milder weather conditions and favorable development from prior events contributing to a 62 combined ratio and $1.2 billion of underwriting income for the quarter. Milder weather in the fourth quarter also favorably influenced the underlying combined ratio due to lower non-catastrophe claim frequency. For the full year, higher catastrophe losses drove the combined ratio increase in 2023 compared to 2022. Full year catastrophe losses of $4.5 billion were higher than our historical experience and translated to a catastrophe loss ratio that was 17 points higher than prior year and roughly 14 points above the 10-year average from 2013 to 2022. As you can see from the chart on the right, the full year underlying combined ratio declined from 70.3 in 2022 to 67.3 in 2023, reflecting higher average premiums from rate increases, partially offset by higher claims severity due to materials and labor costs.With an industry-leading product, advanced pricing, underwriting and analytics, broad distribution capabilities and a comprehensive reinsurance program, we will continue to leverage homeowners as a growth opportunity and remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in this line. Moving to slide 10, let’s discuss how we are advancing transformative growth to provide customers low-cost protection through broad distribution. We remain focused on four key elements of this multiyear initiative, as you can see on this slide. We have improved our cost structure to enhance our competitive price position. In the current environment with most competitors taking large rate increases, it’s difficult to pinpoint competitive position.That said, our relative competitive position likely deteriorated in 2023. But as many of our competitors continue to implement rate increases and our expenses decline, we believe our competitive position will improve enhancing growth opportunities as part of transformative growth. Redesigned, affordable, simple and connected products currently available for auto insurance in seven states with plans for further expansion this year, both improve customer value and deliver a differentiated customer experience. National General independent agent growth prospects will be further enhanced by expanding Custom 360 products, which were live in 16 states as of year-end 2023 and expect to be in nearly every state by the end of 2024. Expanding customer access will also support market share growth and we have made good progress in all three channels.Increasing sophistication and customer acquisition continues to advance and will improve the effectiveness of increased advertising spend in 2024, as we look to grow in more states. A new technology ecosystem is also being deployed to improve the customer experience, speed-to-market and reduce costs for legacy technology platforms. Let me turn it over to Jess now to talk about expense reductions and other operating results.Jesse Merten: All right. Thank you, Mario. On slide 11 we delve deeper into how we are improving customer value through expense reductions. As shown in the chart on the left, the Property-Liability underwriting expense ratio decreased two points from 2022 to 2023 as we continue to focus on lowering costs to provide more value to customers and some of the benefits of higher earned premium growth relative to fixed costs. The right half of the chart provides additional context on the drivers of the 1.3-point improvement in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The first red bar shows the two-tenth of a point impact from increased advertising spend, reflecting the slight increase was driven by seasonal investment changes and growth investments in rate adequacy states.The second green bar shows the 1.4 -- 1.4-point decline in operating costs, which was mainly driven by lower employee-related costs and the impact of higher premiums relative to fixed costs in the quarter. Shifting to the longer term trend in the chart on the right, we remain committed to reducing the adjusted expense ratio as part of transformative growth. As a reminder, the adjusted expense ratio starts with our underwriting expense ratio, which I just covered and excludes restructuring COVID-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and advertising expense. It then adds our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims. Those expenses are excluded because catastrophe-related costs tend to fluctuate.Through innovation, process improvement and strong execution, we have driven significant improvement in expenses for the fourth quarter and year-end 2023 adjusted expense ratio of 24.7. This reflects decreases in both the underwriting expense and non-cat claims expense ratio compared to the prior year quarter. Now moving to slide 12, I will cover investment results. This quarter showed how our proactive approach to duration management benefits results. The chart on the left shows changes we made in the duration of the bond portfolio in comparison to bond market yields, from the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2022, lowering fixed-income duration, mitigated losses as rates rose. Beginning in Q4 of 2022, we began to extend duration which when combined with higher yields has increased market-based income.Our fixed income yield, shown in the table below the chart, remains below the current intermediate corporate bond yield, reflecting an additional opportunity to increase yields as we continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows into higher interest rates. The bar chart on the right shows the income and total return benefits of these decisions. As you can see in the table on the chart, the total return of our portfolio was 4.6% in the fourth quarter and 6.7% for the year. Portfolio returns in both periods reflect income earned, as well as higher fixed income valuations due to the decline in market yields in the fourth quarter. Net investment income totaled $604 million in the quarter, which was $47 million above the fourth quarter of last year.Market based income of $604 million shown in blue, was $140 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting the repositioning of the fixed income portfolio into longer duration and the benefit from higher yielding assets that sustainably increase income. Market based income also benefit -- benefited from higher fixed-income balances. Performance based income of $60 million shown in black, was 87 million below the prior year quarter due to lower valuation increases and fewer sales of underlying assets. As we have stated previously, the performance based portfolio is expected to enhance long-term returns as demonstrated through our five-year and 10-year internal rates of return of 12% and volatility in these assets from quarter-to-quarter is expected.Slide 13 covers results for our Protection Services businesses. Revenue in these businesses increased 11.8% to $719 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter. This result is mainly driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans, which increased 19.6% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting expanded product breadth and international growth. In the table on the right, you will see adjusted net income of $4 million in the fourth quarter decreased $34 million as compared to the prior year quarter. This decrease is attributable to the results of a state income tax examination that increased the effective state tax rate that we apply, which increased deferred income taxes by $43 million in the quarter for future tax payments and Protection Services, largely related to dealer services.The impact of the tax change on the enterprise was a net benefit of $6 million. We do not anticipate that these tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our ongoing operations. Shifting now to slide 14, our Health and Benefits businesses continue to generate profitable growth. From the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue of $630 million increased by $50 million compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in individual health, group health, as well as fees and other revenue. Adjusted net income of $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, increased $2 million compared to the prior year quarter as individual health revenue growth partially offset higher benefit ratios in group health. As you know, late last year, we announced a decision to pursue the divestiture of our Health and Benefits business following the successful integration of Allstate’s voluntary benefits business in National General’s Group and individual health businesses.We continue to anticipate a transaction will be completed in 2024. We will close on slide 15 by reviewing Allstate’s financial condition and capital position. Allstate’s proactive capital management approach provides the financial flexibility, liquidity and capital resources necessary to navigate a challenging operating environment, while providing support for long-term value creation. Fourth quarter results demonstrated the company’s capital generation capabilities with a statutory surplus in holding company assets of $18 billion, increasing by $1.6 billion compared to the prior quarter. Assets held at the holding company also increased to $3.4 billion. The increase to the prior quarter primarily reflects a return of capital from National General statutory entities, partially offset by common shareholder dividends.Additionally, GAAP shareholders’ equity of $17.8 billion increased $3.2 billion compared to the prior quarter, reflecting $1.5 billion of GAAP net income and the improved unrealized position on fixed income securities of $1.9 billion. We continue to proactively manage capital, make progress on the comprehensive profit improvement plan and invest in transformative growth. We remain confident that these strategic actions will generate attractive shareholder returns.

The company reported a loss of $1.33 per share in the year-ago quarter.Operating revenues of $14.9 billion rose 10% year over year in the quarter under review. The year-over-year growth was due to a 10.7% increase in Property-Liability insurance premiums earned. Yet, the top line fell short of the consensus mark by a whisker.The quarterly results benefited on the back of prudent rate increases, a rise in investment income, strong underwriting results, favorable weather conditions and a decline in expenses.

The metric was aided by a rise in earned premiums, reduced catastrophe losses and favorable underlying loss experience. The combined ratio of 89.5% improved 1,960 basis points (bps) year over year in the quarter under review and came lower than our estimate of 96.6%.The Protection Services segment’s revenues grew 11.8% year over year to $719 million in the fourth quarter, thanks to strength in Allstate Protection Plans.

15 States with the Cheapest Car Insurance In The US`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-states-cheapest-car-insurance-231349151.html`2024-02-08 17:08:49`"In this article, we will look at the 15 states with the cheapest car insurance in the US. If you want to skip our comprehensive analysis of the car insurance market in the US, you can go directly to 5 States with the Cheapest Car Insurance In The US.Car insurance operates as a mutual agreement between you and an insurance company. In this arrangement, you commit to paying premiums, and in return, the insurance company protects against financial losses resulting from accidents or damage to your vehicle. By paying a premium, you secure an agreement with the insurance company, and they commit to covering your losses as specified in your policy. These policies are tailored to individual needs and budgets, allowing you to customize coverage amounts accordingly. Typically, policy terms span six or twelve months and are renewable. The insurance provider will inform you when it's time to renew your policy and submit another premium payment.In most US states, it's a legal requirement to have car insurance. If you cause a car accident, the auto liability coverage mandated by your insurance helps cover certain expenses. This includes the other party's medical bills and the repair or replacement of their vehicle or property damaged in the accident. Additionally, this coverage assists in paying for your legal fees if you end up in court due to the accident.Many drivers get car insurance because it's a legal requirement, but it's not just about meeting the minimum coverage. There are several reasons to consider having car insurance. It serves as a financial safeguard for you and your family, preventing significant expenses. By investing a modest amount now, you can avoid hefty costs in the future. Quality car insurance provides protection for you, your family, passengers, and other drivers. In the event of an accident, having the right coverage ensures that you're financially prepared for property damage or bodily injury expenses. Dealing with the aftermath of a car accident can be time-consuming and tiresome. With proper coverage, you can sidestep the hassle of negotiating with other parties involved, managing repair or replacement costs for your vehicle, and handling various headaches that may arise. A comprehensive auto insurance policy not only assists with towing, repairs, and replacements for your vehicle but also covers damages to other drivers.This year, auto insurance rates have seen another increase, and an expert attributes it to a combination of factors, including the higher costs of cars and parts, as well as a growing number of accidents. Scott Holeman, a spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, appeared in an interview on 25News where he pointed out that insurance companies incur higher expenses not only in repairing vehicles but also in dealing with legal actions arising from car accidents. Speaking on the matter, Holeman stated, “That litigation has a direct impact on insurance premiums. There are these high-dollar rewards in court cases. That’s going to be passed along to consumers.” He also highlighted that the prevalence of more technologically advanced cars on the roads is contributing to the overall increase in insurance prices. According to Holeman, insurance companies are incurring $1.12 in expenses for every $1 of premium written, essentially paying out more than they are taking in. He noted that the persistently high rates of accidents will likely keep insurance rates elevated in the foreseeable future.According to auto insurance processing company CCC Intelligent Solutions, the average repair cost for a traditional vehicle currently stands at $4,437. For electric vehicles, the average repair expense is 49% higher at $6,618. This increase is attributed to the additional technological components in electric vehicles and the specialized handling required for their electric powertrains. Insurers have responded to the surge in repair costs, witnessing a 64% rise in the average collision insurance claim from 2018 to 2022, reaching $5,992 according to the Insurance Information Institute. To counteract the escalating repair expenses, insurance providers have significantly increased drivers' premiums. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals that the cost of auto insurance in the United States experienced a notable increase of over 20% in 2023, marking the most substantial annual surge since 1976.In the realm of US motor insurance, standout players include The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR), Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV), and The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL). These companies have firmly established themselves as key influencers in the industry, contributing significantly to the dynamic and competitive landscape of motor insurance in the United States.The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR), one of the leading US insurance holding companies, shared positive news about its performance in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Progressive Corporation, in its latest earnings report on January 24, 2024, exceeded expectations with an EPS Normalized Actual of $2.97, surpassing estimates by $0.55. Additionally, the EPS GAAP Actual stood at $3.37, surpassing predictions by $0.79, and the company reported a revenue of $15.13 billion.Travelers Companies Inc. (NYSE:TRV) had a strong finish to the fourth quarter of 2023, especially in the property casualty insurance sector. Travelers Companies Inc. (NYSE:TRV) reported a net income of $1.626 billion. This was driven by a substantial increase in premiums, which went up by 13% and almost reached the $10 billion mark. Providing a more detailed look at the earnings, Travelers Companies Inc. (NYSE: TRV) disclosed that the core income per share reached $7.01.Meanwhile, in December, The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) raised auto insurance rates by 16.5% across 15 locations, leading to an overall premium impact of 5%. This figure includes the approved rate increases by the Departments of Insurance in California, New York, and New Jersey.

For the entire fourth quarter, the pre-tax total for catastrophe losses was $68 million.Let's now take a look at the 15 states with the cheapest car insurance in the US.Our MethodologyThis article provides a compilation of the 15 states with the cheapest car insurance in the US.

3 of the Smartest AI Stocks to Buy Now for Long-Term Growth`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-smartest-ai-stocks-buy-005147733.html`2024-01-28 00:51:47`Are you looking for AI stocks that could provide long-term growth? Artificial intelligence is undoubtedly the most popular theme of 2023, grabbing headlines left and right and significantly impacting the performance of most of the IT industry.The impact of AI has created new opportunities for various industries to grow and expand, ranging from health care to banking and even real estate. The applications of AI are virtually limitless. Now that we’ve arrived at the 2024 starting line, the next question is, will the 2023 darlings remain at the top, or will a new generation of AI stocks take the lead? Investors should consider purchasing the top AI stocks in 2024 for long-term growth.First on our list is a global leader in Artificial Intelligence and computational science. Altair Engineering (NASDAQ:ALTR) has been a groundbreaker in AI and computational science by revolutionizing the cloud solutions and high-performance computing landscape (HPC). Its specialization in data analytics, simulation software, and optimization products opens its doors to diverse clients.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsALTR’s latest version of HPCWorks 2024 provided its users with an enhanced user interface and functionality with the integration of AI that helps streamline workflow distribution and optimize cloud scaling. The company also offers client engineering services to help support customers in the long term with its ongoing expertise.Looking closer at its financials, ALTR’s most recent report points to a robust 14.8% YoY growth in software product revenue and a 12.3% total revenue growth YoY. Non-GAAP metrics also showed a 126.3% rise in adjusted EBITDA and a 197.0% increase in net income YoY.Analysts also praise ALTR with their “Strong Buy” recommendation and a projected high target price of $95.00. That might not look like a lot in terms of current price levels, but investors should also remember that ALTR is one of the AI and computational science leaders. As the technology moves towards adoption in every part of our society, so does its growth. In our view, that’s a growth story we want to be a part of, so we recommend ALTR as a buy-rated AI stock for long-term growth.Source: shutterstock.com/Victor RunovThe next one on our list may not be a direct AI play, but it is one of the primary beneficiaries of the AI boom. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an application-optimized server and storage systems provider for enterprise data centers in high-demanding tasks like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and edge computing. Unlike other companies like Nvidia, which sells GPUs, the company offers a complete IT solution wherein it packages these and other components into server racks for sale to a broad audience. That means that as AI adoptions grow to a full scale, so will SMCI.The company has also announced its upcoming support for the new NVIDIA HGX H200, which comes with H200 Tensor Core GPU and newer rack solutions optimized for AI, edge computing, and cloud service providers.Despite missing the mark in a few key points, its latest financials and announcements make a strong case for a worthy investment for AI enthusiasts. Net sales were strong at $2.12 billion, growing 14.5% YoY. Meanwhile, net income ended at $157 million, lower YoY due to increased operating expenses, mainly research and development, and lower operating income. Despite that, SMCI maintains a positive outlook for FY’24, which helps boost investor confidence. YTD, the stock is already up over 52% – and the sky might really be the limit on this stock in 2024.The final company on our list of AI stocks is another frontrunner in the AI race that could provide long-term growth. Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) is mainly known for its Chinese language Internet search engine, one of the most popular ones used globally.The company’s operations fall under two segments: Baidu Core for its search-based, feed-based, and online marketing services with AI initiatives, and iQIYI for its online entertainment content produced originally or with other content partners. BIDU has been investing heavily in AI, and its latest ERNIE 4.0, accessible through ERNIE Bot and Cloud API, shows the company’s commitment to being at the forefront of AI advancements.Baidu’s latest financials indicate a 6% YoY revenue growth. Meanwhile, the Baidu Core segment reported a 5% growth in total revenue and a 6% growth in non-online marketing revenue. In addition, the company’s Apollo Go ride-hailing service also had a substantial 73% increase in reported rides, with cumulative rides for the public reaching 4.1 million. The Baidu app also saw a 5% increase in monthly active users YoY. Like most stocks in China, the 1-YR performance hasn’t been stellar. In fact, BIDU is down ~22% over the past year. However, with stellar numbers and a solid commitment to advancing AI, Baidu is one of the best stocks for investors looking to ride the AI boom.On the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

3 Under-the-Radar Chip Stocks Worth Buying in 2024`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-under-radar-chip-stocks-155446493.html`2024-02-01 15:54:46`As the engine of artificial intelligence (AI) models and applications, stocks of microchip and semiconductor companies remain red hot. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) has risen 45% in the last 12 months, including a 6% increase this year.Many of the better known chip stocks, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), have seen their share price more than double over the past year. And the gains look likely to continue as global demand for the microchips needed to power AI continues to swell and earnings move steadily upwards. According to Allied Market Research, the global AI chip market was valued at $14.9 billion in 2022, and is projected to reach $383.7 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.2%.That’s strong growth and it should continue to underpin the rise of chip stocks over the near term. Here are three under-the-radar chip stocks worth buying in 2024.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is a European company that doesn’t get the attention it deserves considering that it is one of the most important semiconductor-equipment makers in the world. Its stock has largely trailed the gains seen in other chipmakers, having risen only 33% in the last 12 months.However, that underperformance now looks to be changing with ASML stock having gained 22% so far in 2024. A strong earnings print delivered recently and growing demand for its AI microchips is fueling the stock’s rally.Due to surging demand for its microchips that power AI models, ASML posted fourth quarter results that crushed analyst expectations, including revenue of €7.2 billion ($7.82 billion U.S.) versus €6.90 billion that was expected. The company’s Q4 profit totaled €2.05 billion vs €1.86 billion that was expected. ASML’s revenue for all of last year rose 30% from 2022. ASML has an advantage in that it makes a machine called an “extreme ultraviolet lithography” that is required to make the world’s most advanced chips.Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.comWhile better known than ASML, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) still flies under the radar compared to other microchip and semiconductor companies. Applied Materials, which supplies the materials and equipment needed to make microchips and semiconductors, has seen its stock rise 47% in the last 12 months. While that’s a strong return, it pales in comparison to the double and triple share price returns seen in other chip stocks over the same time period.Demand for Applied Materials’s products has never been stronger and that has helped the company’s earnings. In November of last year, Applied Materials reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.12, which was well ahead of the $1.99 expected on Wall Street. Revenue came in at $6.70 billion, which was also above analysts’ expectations of $6.50 billion. The company is next due to report earnings on Feb. 15 and has forecast revenue with a midpoint of $6.50 billion.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comFor a beaten down chip stock that looks undervalued, consider Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). The legacy chipmaker’s share price is down 10% over the last 12 months, including a 5% pullback year to date. Trading at 22 times future earnings estimates, TXN stock looks cheap compared to most other microchip and semiconductor securities. Texas Instruments also pays a dividend of $1.30 per share, giving the stock a yield of 3.24%. Any dividend from a chip stock is pretty rare.TXN stock has been knocked lower in recent weeks after it issued forward guidance that missed Wall Street targets. The company cited softness in the automotive and industrial sectors as the reason for the soft guidance. Texas Instruments makes microchips that go into products in nearly every sector of the American economy, from motor vehicles to consumer electronics. In time, the company and its stock should bounce back. Meanwhile, there’s that dividend payment.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in AMAT.

12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-nasdaq-stocks-buy-112251252.html`2024-02-10 11:22:51`In this article, we discuss 12 best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and NASDAQ’s performance, head over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024. In December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains. The market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.The trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.Despite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.To benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Our Methodology We chose the top stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Photo by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global semiconductor company specializing in the design and development of complex digital and mixed-signal semiconductor devices. It operates in two segments – Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has projected a 2024 outlook with anticipated revenue of $50 billion and EBITDA margins of 60%. The company acknowledged some cyclical challenges in its broadband and storage semiconductor businesses but anticipates strength in the latter part of the year. Despite expected headwinds in the first half of 2024, investment advisory firm Summit Insights Group upgraded Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock to Buy on December 8, expressing confidence that the company will likely outperform its outlook for 2024.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.Semiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90Micron Technology, Inc.

Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the leading position holder in the company, with 8.10 million shares worth $551.6 million.Here is what Claret Asset Management has to say about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 102Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks for 2024. On January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.11. Revenue for the period increased 12.5% year-over-year to $8.83 billion, topping market expectations by $120 million. The global streaming paid memberships increased by 13.12 million to 260.28 million. Netflix revealed Q1 2024 guidance, indicating anticipated revenue of $9.24 billion compared to the consensus estimate of $9.26 billion, and projected earnings per share (EPS) of $4.49 as opposed to the consensus estimate of $4.14.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 102 hedge funds were bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), compared to 114 funds in the preceding quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is one of the biggest stakeholders of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth over $970 million. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) was part of 110 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 112 in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.28 billion.White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a global software company operating in three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024.

(NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 134Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 7th on our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a FQ1 GAAP EPS of $2.18 and a revenue of $119.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.07 and $1.34 billion, respectively.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 135 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 915.5 million shares worth $156.75 billion.Bireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 163Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in. On January 30, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported its fourth quarter results. The GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.64 and the revenue stood at $86.31 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.04 and $1.04 billion, respectively. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has reintroduced its AI chatbot, now named Gemini, as a subscription service with different tiers, following a model similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT. The service, ranging from a free version to the premium Ultra 1.0 model priced at $19.99 per month, can perform complex tasks such as coding, creative collaboration, and logical reasoning.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 163 hedge funds were long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 152 funds in the prior quarter. Harris Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $3 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The FPA Crescent Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024.  Suggested articles:Top 12 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge Funds10 Best Fintech Stocks To Buy In 202411 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes`['AMD', 'AVGO', 'ADBE', 'NFLX', 'MU', 'GOOG', 'AAPL', 'AMZN']`

11 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-faang-stocks-invest-215344511.html`2024-02-09 21:53:44`"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best FAANG stocks to invest in. To skip our detailed analysis of the tech industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In.The technology sector has been on a steady rise for quite a while now, and the most obvious answer to the industry's propulsion to greater and greater heights is the ongoing obsession with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Many within the AI space today are large tech companies, such as the FAANG names. These days, however, a new moniker has been on the rise to identify the best tech companies of the day: the Magnificent Seven.The original cohort of tech names to keep an eye on included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), all coming together to form the FAANG group. Today, these companies are challenged by several others in the market, particularly semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA isn't alone either, and so the original list of FAANG stocks has had to accommodate the rise of new and old mega-tech companies bolstered by the emergence of AI.Regardless of what you call these companies or who joins these new exciting groups, the fact remains that the tech sector has been abuzz with news of innovations, rising investments, and higher profitability. At the end of the day, it's starting to look like tech companies really are starting to rule the world.On February 8, Gene Munster, the managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss recent trends in the tech sector and the rise of FAANG stocks, particularly Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here's what he had to say:""They have the biggest upside potential relative to where expectations are... these three, I think, are largely unappreciated. I just wanna start with Meta. I think it's the biggest AI opportunity that's misunderstood. Most investors understand that Meta is using AI to improve ad campaigns, ad attribution... but there is a significant underappreciated lever that could take this into a whole different atmosphere. This theory comes from Deepwater's Doug Clinton. He believes that ultimately, they will monetize Llama. Llama is an opensource model. The other foundation models, Claude, and ChatGPT, and Gemini, they're all closed. Llama has 30 million downloads. If they monetize this, they will likely announce a cloud infrastructure... that is a whole new shift, and new benefit to Meta.""On the rise of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, Munster said the following:""Apple's gonna come out with their own foundation model likely in June, and they're gonna allow this to do personalized AI. This is really gonna capture 20% of the world's interest, and they can charge $10 a month for this.""Most investors have been overlooking Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, but Munster thinks the company is on its way to benefitting from a new opportunity.In an additional boost for the tech sector, the Biden Administration has announced a $5 billion investment in chips, a move that is bound to uplift the semiconductor industry. On February 9, Ronnie Chatterji, professor at Duke University and former White House Chips Coordinator, joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss this move. He noted that this move signals a partnership between the public and private sectors to ensure that the US continues to lead ""in the current generation of chips"" alongside the ""next generation."" The investment is thus being welcomed overwhelmingly and may signal greater things for semiconductor companies in 2024.With the current situation being so overwhelmingly in favor of tech companies, we have compiled a list of the best FAANG stocks to buy now. These include some of the top American tech stocks to buy apart from the original FAANG stocks.A technician at a workstation, preparing and calibrating a sensor for automotive microcontrollers.Our Methodology We compiled our list of the best FAANG stocks to invest in by consulting Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the third quarter and selecting major tech companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”Like Meta Platforms, Inc.

13 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-big-company-stocks-213202674.html`2024-02-09 21:32:02`In this article, we discuss the 13 best big company stocks to buy. To skip the latest news and analysts’ sentiments around the current economic conditions, go directly to the 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.Despite the doubts, the market performed exceptionally in 2023. While several analysts believed it to be temporary, the new year isn’t showing many signs of weakness in the market. Although there have been a few hurdles, the overall prediction is that the Federal Reserve will manage to guide the US economy toward a soft landing rather than a recession, as was expected in the last two years. However, analysts still advise caution in the short term. Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, said: “As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.”Nevertheless, the latest news suggests that the financial markets are heading in the right direction as the S&P 500 touched 5000 for the first time at the time of market opening on February 9 after December inflation data, which turned out to be even lower than initially reported. While the Fed recently revealed that it will take its time to review market data before making any decision to announce rate cuts, many analysts believe that the rate cuts can begin in the first half of 2024.Despite the positive predictions around the market, the varying opinions of experts can lead to further confusion among novice investors, which is why the best big company stocks are some of the safest bets for such people. These big company stocks bring a sense of safety among investors as the losses are never permanent, even during bear market conditions. Additionally, the best company stocks are usually cash-rich with strong balance sheets and can easily weather any economic disasters. Furthermore, their wealth also allows them to pay steady dividends. For example, one of the giants in the energy sector, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has increased its dividends for the last 37 years, even though the last 10 years have seen some significant volatility in the energy sectors. Similarly, another blue-chip stock, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its dividend by 7% on February 9 despite year-over-year (YoY) revenue declines across major markets in the fourth quarter of 2023.The big company stocks do not guarantee positive returns all the time but provide ample opportunities for investors when they fall. For example, earlier this month, we discussed the 10 blue-chip stocks at 52-week lows, which you should check out as these are also some of the best big company stocks that provide prime entry points for investors. However, our current list uses a different methodology, and some of our current best big company stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). After an exceptional performance in 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) declared its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share on February 1 and increased its previous share buyback authorization by $50 billion. The company nearly gained 200% in the year and is up nearly 36% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on February 9.A large stock market board displaying the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Growth Index.Our MethodologyTo choose the best big company stocks, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify mega-cap stocks with an estimated 5-year EPS growth of over 15%. These stocks were then listed according to the number of their hedge fund investors in the third quarter of 2023. The hedge fund sentiment was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

(NASDAQ:ASML) announced an interim dividend of EUR 1.45 per share, which is payable by February 14.ASML Holding N.V.

(NASDAQ:META).ClearBridge Investments stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Another welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture, which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.On an individual stock basis, the largest contributors to absolute returns in the quarter included ASML and Tokyo Electron in the IT sector.”Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a New Jersey-based company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets prescription medicines, vaccines, animal health products, etc.On February 5, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced that it would buy the aqua business from Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE:ELAN) for $1.3 billion in cash.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an Indiana-based company that discovers, develops, and markets human healthcare products.On February 6, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) posted its Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $2.49, which beat the estimates by $0.12.

Stock performance was strong due to strong third quarter sales of blockbuster diabetes medicine Mounjaro and ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the company’s obesity and diabetes franchises. We continue to think Lilly is well positioned to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.We own Eli Lilly and Company, which we believe will remain a leader in the GLP-1 medicine class with Mounjaro, Zepbound, and the company’s deep pipeline of next generation GLP-1 medicines.”Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive.

(NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy. Suggested articles:12 Highest-Paid Women CEOs12 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds10 Best Augmented Reality Stocks Under $5Disclosure.

Here's Why We're Wary Of Buying Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) For Its Upcoming Dividend`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-were-wary-buying-125538570.html`2024-02-10 12:55:38`Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, Amgen investors that purchase the stock on or after the 15th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 7th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$2.25 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$9.00 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Amgen has a trailing yield of approximately 3.1% on its current stock price of US$291.12. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Amgen has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Amgen paid out 68% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Amgen generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 63% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Stocks with flat earnings can still be attractive dividend payers, but it is important to be more conservative with your approach and demand a greater margin for safety when it comes to dividend sustainability. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's not encouraging to see that Amgen's earnings are effectively flat over the past five years. We'd take that over an earnings decline any day, but in the long run, the best dividend stocks all grow their earnings per share.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Amgen has lifted its dividend by approximately 17% a year on average.Is Amgen an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Amgen has been unable to generate earnings growth, but at least its dividend looks sustainable, with its profit and cashflow payout ratios within reasonable limits. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being.Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Amgen. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Amgen (1 can't be ignored) you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, Puma Biotech is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Amgen has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that PBYI has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PBYI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.89, while AMGN has a forward P/E of 15.12. We also note that PBYI has a PEG ratio of 1.29. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. AMGN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.78.Another notable valuation metric for PBYI is its P/B ratio of 6.64. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AMGN has a P/B of 25.32.These metrics, and several others, help PBYI earn a Value grade of A, while AMGN has been given a Value grade of C.PBYI stands above AMGN thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that PBYI is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Invest with Confidence: Intrinsic Value Unveiled of Amgen Inc`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-confidence-intrinsic-value-unveiled-110159720.html`2024-02-09 11:01:59`In this article, we will take a look into Amgen Inc's (NASDAQ:AMGN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with AMGN.As of 2024-02-09, Amgen Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $291.62. It's currently trading at a price of $294.95. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -1.14%. The company is fair valued.The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amgen Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.TermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$18.21GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.17%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 10.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.Growth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=173.32Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=118.3Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=291.62GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $165.32. This valuation indicates that the Amgen Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -78.41%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.72 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76 but increased from $1.67 in the year-ago quarter.

Ameriprise Financial Inc's Dividend Analysis`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameriprise-financial-incs-dividend-analysis-103445150.html`2024-02-07 10:34:45`Ameriprise Financial Inc(NYSE:AMP) recently announced a dividend of $1.35 per share, payable on 2024-02-27, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-02-08. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Ameriprise Financial Inc's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with AEP.High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?Ameriprise Financial has emerged as a major player in the U.S. market for asset and wealth management, with around $1.3 trillion in total assets under management and advisement at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Ameriprise has one of the largest branded advisor networks in the industry, and about 80% of the company's revenue comes from its asset and wealth management segments. Ameriprise has reduced its exposure to insurance with the sale of its auto and home insurance business in 2019 and discontinuing the sale of its proprietary fixed annuities in 2020. Around 90% of the company's pretax earnings are from the United States.Ameriprise Financial Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 2005. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis.Ameriprise Financial Inc has increased its dividend each year since 2005. The stock is thus listed as a dividend achiever, an honor that is given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 19 years. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.As of today, Ameriprise Financial Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 1.37%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.Ameriprise Financial Inc's dividend yield of 1.35% is near a 10-year low and underperforms than 90.21% of global competitors in the Asset Management industry, suggesting that the company's dividend yield may not be a compelling proposition for income investors.Over the past three years, Ameriprise Financial Inc's annual dividend growth rate was 8.60%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate decreased to 8.30% per year. And over the past decade, Ameriprise Financial Inc's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at an impressive 11.60%.Based on Ameriprise Financial Inc's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Ameriprise Financial Inc stock as of today is approximately 2.01%.To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, Ameriprise Financial Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.18.Ameriprise Financial Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Ameriprise Financial Inc's profitability 8 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Ameriprise Financial Inc's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Ameriprise Financial Inc's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Ameriprise Financial Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 10.20% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 57.68% of global competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Ameriprise Financial Inc's earnings increased by approximately 14.20% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 57.62% of global competitors.Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 16.90%, which outperforms approximately 71.35% of global competitors.In conclusion, Ameriprise Financial Inc's history of consistent dividend growth, a reasonable payout ratio, and strong profitability metrics paint a positive picture for dividend sustainability. Coupled with favorable growth metrics, Ameriprise Financial Inc appears to be in a good position to continue rewarding shareholders with dividends. However, the relatively low dividend yield compared to industry peers suggests that investors may need to weigh the prospects of dividend growth against immediate yield.

11 Best Asset Management Stocks to Buy Now`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-asset-management-stocks-130322196.html`2024-02-05 13:03:22`In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best asset management stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our overview of financial markets, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Asset Management Stocks to Buy Now. The U.S. finance industry is a global behemoth unparalleled by any other nation. American banks, such as the Wall Street behemoth JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), investment holding companies like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), hedge funds such as Ken Fisher and Ken Griffin's Fisher Asset Management and Citadel Investment, and asset managers like Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) are behemoths in their respective industries.Each of these firms and their industries play a specific role in the financial sector. Hedge funds typically seek to use client capital and leverage to engage in complex strategies that have led to their owners becoming some of the richest people in the world (you can read (16 Richest Hedge Fund Managers in the World to find out whose sits at the top of the billionaire pyramid). Banks, as we all know, move money all over the world and work with the Federal Reserve to ensure that financial market participants have enough money to finance their business operations and investments.Similarly, asset managers also rely on client money to grow its value over time and take a cut from the profits. This business is so lucrative, that some of the biggest asset management stocks in the world such as Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) are corporate behemoths worth hundreds of billions of dollar in market value. This far outstrips hedge funds, and despite the fact that few hedge funds are publicly traded entities, the difference between hedge funds and asset managers is not well understood.Therefore, before we delve deeper into the best asset management stocks, it's important to understand how the two are similar and different. After all, Insider Monkey's research has shown that hedge fund stock picks tend to outperform stock markets significantly, yet the total assets under management of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates are lower than Apollo Global's cash and investment assets. Therein lies the difference between hedge funds and asset managers, as the former's high tolerance for risk often sees their services limited to those with the biggest risk appetite or the most money.Since asset management stocks are publicly traded, their operations are also far more transparent than those of a hedge fund. This is because every asset management stock is required to file its quarterly and annual reports, along with reports of other material changes with the S.E.C. 413Yet, just like every other stock, asset management stocks are also subject to tailwinds and headwinds. After all, if one can't directly invest with an asset manager, the next best thing might be to buy its stock to gain some exposure to professional players' understanding of the economy. Intuitively speaking, asset managers tend to do well when markets are also performing well. They invest in a myriad of sectors such as the stock market, the currency markets, the bond markets, and commodities. The performance of these markets, and by extension asset management stocks, depends on several factors such as interest rates, economic growth, political conflict, and global supply chain disruptions. For instance, the latest U.S. strikes in Syria were reported in the press soon after 4 p.m. Eastern time, or just in time for market close, and Central Command's press release followed after 4:30 p.m.The start of February is proving to be a great couple of days for asset management penny stocks. As of February 2, 2024, asset management stocks such as Royalty Management Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:RMCO), Puyi Inc. (NASDAQ:PUYI), and The Marygold Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGLD) are posting high single digit share price gains. Other established firms, such as the ones that we've mentioned above are displaying a mixed bag of performance. While Blackstone and Blackrock are down year to date, Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO)'s shares are up close to 13% year to date.This shows that asset management stocks are able to stand on their own despite turmoil in other financial sectors. The start of 2024 is seeing the U.S. regional banking sector start to tremble once again after New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB) absorbed hundreds of millions of dollars as a contingency against office real estate loans and surprise investors during the fourth quarter of 2023.With this important context about asset management stocks, let's take a look at the best asset management stocks.

Disbarment likely awaits Ameriprise advisor accused of storming Capitol on Jan. 6`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disbarment-likely-awaits-ameriprise-advisor-213017998.html`2024-02-02 21:30:17`"Industry disbarment most likely lies in the future for a recently suspended Ameriprise advisor who was arrested this week on charges related to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.Lee A. Giobbie, who has been at Ameriprise since 2017, was taken into custody on Tuesday over felony allegations related to civil disorder and obstruction of an official proceeding and misdemeanors concerning disorderly conduct at the Capitol building and similar charges. According to an FBI statement of facts, Giobbie was among the first rioters to enter the Capitol just over three years ago in protest of the 2020 election results, which many believed had been illegally tipped in favor of current President Joe Biden.The statement cites video recordings made the day of the riots showing Giobbie calling on a crowd of protestors gathered in Washington, D.C., to push past bicycle racks set up as a barrier. After that line had been broken, he repeatedly yelled ""the gates have been breached"" and ""we're going in.""Giobbie fought his way to the steps leading to a Capitol entrance and then was seen urging the crowd to ""push, push, push, push"" against the line of police officers who had fallen back as a last-ditch defense. Once inside, he quickly walked through the Senate rotunda, was briefly detained by an officer in a stairwell and then exited the building.A spokesperson for Ameriprise said, ""Upon learning of the federal indictment, we immediately suspended the advisor pending an investigation by our firm."" The lawyer representing Giobbie — Hope C. Lefeber, a criminal defense attorney out of Philadelphia — did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In an interview earlier this week, NBC News quoted her as saying: ""This man has not engaged in any subversive activities, has not been destructive in any way, has not done a damn thing since Jan. 6. Now we'll have to resolve this and see where this goes.""READ MORE:Ex-broker arrested after Capitol riot dies by suicide: authoritiesFINRA scraps max fines for various financial violationsEx-Wells employee already barred as a broker gets SEC boot from advisory industryBroker expungement? Costs and difficulty set to rise this fallJoe Wojciechowski, an investment fraud lawyer at Chicago-based Stoltman Law, said Giobbie's arrest sets the stage for a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority investigation that could eventually lead to permanent disbarment. He noted that most of the defendants arrested in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riots have pleaded guilty rather than fighting the charges in court.But even if Giobbie pleads to lesser crimes than the ones he's accused of, FINRA is unlikely to allow him to keep his industry credentials and licensing.""It would be a layup type of case,"" Wojciechowski said. ""It would absolutely be within their disciplinary rights to revoke his registration on a permanent basis.""According to a statement released by the U.S. Attorney's office for the District of Columbia for the third anniversary of the riots, 718 of the 1,265 people so far charged with crimes related to the riots have gone on to plead guilty. Only 139 have been guilty at contested trials.Of those who were sentenced, 467 were given periods of incarceration and 154 were put on home detention. The most common charge — made against 1,186 defendants — related to ""entering or remaining in a restricted federal building or ground.""Giobbie's BrokerCheck page is free of disciplinary disclosures, including of his recent arrest. A FINRA spokesperson declined to comment on the case.Lou Straney, a regulatory expert at Arbitration Insight, said it usually takes about 30 days for a criminal complaint disclosure to show up on BrokerCheck after formal proceedings have begun. Straney noted that many advisors who are subject to FINRA investigation simply refuse to go along with the proceedings.""And if he doesn't show up, he's barred for sure,"" Straney said.The FBI's complaint states law enforcement officials learned of Giobbie's participation in the Jan. 6 riots from a confidential informant who saw internet videos of him both outside and inside the Capitol. The informant was able to identify Giobbie because of a Philadelphia Eagles hat was wearing. Giobbie's Facebook page featured at least one photo in which he was wearing the same hat.The videos, according to the bureau's statement of facts, show Giobbie standing early in the day on the east side of the Capitol near a line of bike racks that police had set up as a barricade. Holding a bull horn up to his cellphone, he amplified a broadcast of a speech then being delivered by former President Donald Trump at a park south of the White House known as the Ellipse.Giobbie, according to the complaint, echoed the president when he said ""stop the steal"" — a popular rallying cry for people who question the 2020 election. When Trump said, ""Does anyone believe Biden got 80 million votes?,"" Giobbie yelled, ""No!""According to Giobbie's BrokerCheck record, he has been in the industry for 17 years. Before Ameriprise, he was at Citigroup Global Markets from 2007 to 2009 and then Janney Montgomery Scott until 2017.Wojciechowski noted that even if Giobbie lost his brokerage licenses, he would not necessarily be barred from acting as an investment advisor. Many brokers have seen their FINRA certifications pulled and continued working with clients by maintaining registration at the state level.""And then sometimes you don't have any supervision, or any regulator who really pays attention to you,"" Wojciechowski said. ""It's a big problem.""Related Quotes"`['AMP']`
25 Cheap Safe English Speaking Countries For Americans`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-cheap-safe-english-speaking-202400718.html`2024-02-02 20:24:00`"In this article, we will take a look at the 25 cheap safe English speaking countries for Americans. If you want to skip our discussion on the emigration trends, you can go directly to the 5 Cheap Safe English Speaking Countries For Americans.According to estimates from the US Department of State, approximately 9 million Americans may be living overseas. This is more than double the estimated figure of 4.1 million Americans residing in foreign countries in 1999. Moreover, a poll by Gallup revealed that 15% of US citizens wanted to move abroad permanently as of 2021. Various factors drive Americans to consider relocation to foreign countries. A survey conducted by Preply revealed that 59% of respondents cited concerns about gun violence as a significant motivation for considering moving abroad. Meanwhile, approximately a quarter of Generation Z Americans stated that they want to relocate for improved social programs such as healthcare. For 19% of participants, seeking a new cultural experience was the main reason for settling in a foreign country. Moreover, 18% identified the high cost of living in the United States as a key factor influencing their decision to move, while 17% attributed their desire to relocate to the political environment in the US. The increase in interest in traveling or moving abroad has also coincided with national events, according to Where Can I Live, a UK-based firm that helps people relocate. The firm saw a 72% increase in traffic from the US to its website after Roe vs. Wade was overturned, a 64% increase after Joe Biden’s Election win, and a 26% increase after the Uvalde shooting in Texas.Retirees from the US are also contributing to the trend of settling abroad. According to the Social Security Administration, about 750,000 Americans get their retirement benefits transferred to overseas bank accounts. The US State Department estimates that 5 million overseas Americans are retirees, which makes up 12% of the 45 million retirees overall. One of the reasons for US citizens to search for cheap safe English-speaking countries to live in is the rising cost of living within the US. The consumer price index for the 12 months ending December 2023 rose by 3.4%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Furthermore, a New York-based insurance firm estimates that Americans can expect to live 25 years beyond the retirement age of 65 and will require a substantial sum of $987,000 to cover post-retirement expenses. Thus, it is no wonder that 4 in 10 workers and 3 in 10 retirees press a lack of confidence in their ability to keep up with inflation during retirement, according to findings from a Retirement Confidence Survey.In addition to this, Medicare does not cover dental work or long-term care, which can cost about $54,000 to $106,000 a year for retirees. Due to the rising out-of-pocket expenses and cost of long-term care, the market for long-term care insurance is expanding. The market size for long-term care private insurance reached $14.37 billion in 2022, and the CAGR is expected to be 5.84% between 2023 and 2030. Some of the well-reputed long term care insurance companies heading into 2024 include Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP), Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC), and The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL).

Insiders At Ameriprise Financial Sold US$28m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-ameriprise-financial-sold-us-110012828.html`2024-02-01 11:00:12`Over the past year, many Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman & CEO, James Cracchiolo, sold US$14m worth of shares at a price of US$353 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$387. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 20% of James Cracchiolo's stake.Ameriprise Financial insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Ameriprise Financial. In total, President of Advice & Wealth Management - Products and Service Delivery Joseph Sweeney dumped US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Ameriprise Financial insiders own about US$104m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.An insider hasn't bought Ameriprise Financial stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company.

Top 12 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-12-stocks-buy-10-152540880.html`2024-02-10 15:25:40`In this piece, we will take a look at the top 12 stocks to buy in 10 different sectors for the next 3 months. If you want to skip our introduction to how spreading a portfolio across several sectors might help long term performance according to financial literature, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months.The spread of technology and the broad use of the Internet by people belonging to all walks of life has significantly increased the exposure that people have to information. This is true for politics, sports, and finance - as both those who work in these industries and others whose well being is tied to their performance are able to stay abreast with the latest developments. Social media stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and private companies like Elon Musk's well known X (formerly called Twitter) enable a connected world and a much well informed global populace.For instance, if you're interested to learn from those who spend the better part of their day dabbling in all things finance, then you can always consult Twitter. Diverse viewpoints are important when it comes to risking money on stocks, and another common way of hedging an investment portfolio's risk is through diversification as well. In finance theory, diversification reduces the variance that a broader portfolio's returns might face. In other words, it reduces the wild downswings that might significantly reduce principal value in case of an untoward event in one industry, providing investors with peace of mind and better chances of optimal cardiovascular performance.Additionally, the sheer plethora of information available to investors through the Internet and traditional media also allows them to rapidly tailor and trim their investments in response to news. For instance, it takes mere seconds for all major stock indexes such as the NASDAQ, the S&P 500, and the NYSE to fall when the Federal Reserve surprises investors by beefing up interest rates, or rise when macroeconomic and political stability is assured. When it comes to investing in stocks that belong to different sectors, a well-informed investor is easily able to keep up to date with the performance of sectors that are completely different from each other such as high technology biotechnology stocks and good old oil crude oil exploration and production stocks.Even if we were to ignore complex mathematical complications of standard deviation and other variables that professionals rely on when investing in stocks in different sectors, doing so also seems to make sense on an intuitive scale. For instance, let's consider two different sectors and recent stock market events to see how this might work. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and the Federal Reserve started to increase interest rates in response to record inflation levels, the bifurcation of the stock market into different sectors became clear. We've briefly mentioned one of these, i.e., oil and energy, above, and the second sector is technology. After the Russian invasion and the official settling in of the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate hiking cycle, oil stocks soared as investors correctly realized that they would benefit from a shakeup in the global oil industry.At the same time, tight macroeconomic conditions created by high interest rates and high inflation meant that big ticket technology and high growth stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted double or even triple digit percentage losses on the stock market. For the investor who was prudent enough to have invested in different sectors at the start of 2022, the juicy returns and dividends offered by oil stocks would have helped ease or even reverse the pain that technology stocks experienced in 2022.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top stocks in different sectors. The notable picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Photo by Sunrise King on UnsplashOur Methodology To make our list of the stocks to buy in different sectors, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge fund portfolios and picked out stocks from Technology, Materials, Real Estate, Financial Services, Healthcare, Industrial, Communications, Consumer Cyclical, Consumer Defensive, Utilities, and Energy sectors with the highest hedge fund shareholders as of Q3 2023.

How To Earn $500 Per Month From American Tower Corp. Stock`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earn-500-per-month-american-165413384.html`2024-02-09 16:54:13`"At the end of the trading session on Feb. 8, American Tower Corp. (NYSE:AMT) closed at $193.64. American Tower Corp. is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that operates in the wireless and broadcasting communication infrastructure business in 25 countries.On Oct. 26, the company filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ending Sept. 30. The REIT's capital structure includes mandatorily convertible preferred equity and restricted stock units, which accrue dividends. American Tower has reported dividends for common stockholders as distributions paid on common stock.The cash flow from financing activities shows $2.193 billion as distribution to common stockholders for the nine months ending Sept. 30 — 12.71% higher than the distributions for the same period of 2022.American Tower currently pays a quarterly distribution of $1.70 per share, equating to an annualized rate of $6.80 per share. Based on the Feb. 8 close price, its dividend yield is 3.51%.Assuming that your earnings target is $500 per month, or $6,000 annually, from American Tower Corp.'s dividends, you would need to invest an estimated $170,940 which is about 883 shares at $193.64 each. If you want to earn $100 per month, the investment value reduces to $34,188 for about 177 shares.How To Earn $500 Per Month In Passive Income Through Real Estate Without Becoming A LandlordCollecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Dara Khosrowshahi gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.How to calculate an estimated investment value using dividend yields: You can calculate an estimated value of investments using two key variables: the desired annual earnings target of $6,000 or $1,200 and the dividend yield of the stock, which is 3.51% in this case). So, $6,000 / 0.0351 = $170,940 to generate an income of $500 per month, and $1,200 / 0.0351 = $34,188 for $100 per month.To calculate the dividend yield, divide the annual dividend payments by the current price of the stock. Note that a stock’s dividend yield may change because of movement in its prices. Changes in the dividend payments can also impact the yield. Assuming the stock price remains unchanged, the dividend yield will increase when the company increases the dividend value and vice versa.Assume a stock that pays an annual dividend of $2 is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2 / $50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2 / $60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2 / $40).Disclaimer: This calculation is according to the price per share on Feb. 8 using an annualized dividend. The price of American Tower Corp. stock at the close of trading on Feb. 8 was $193.64.Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000. Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Dara Khosrowshahi gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.Image Credit: tony-stoddard on UnsplashSend To MSN:  Send to MSN""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This article How To Earn $500 Per Month From American Tower Corp.

12 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-communication-stocks-buy-121621723.html`2024-02-08 12:16:21`"In this article, we discuss 12 best communication stocks to buy according to hedge funds. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the communication industry, head over to 5 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. In 2023, the communication services sector experienced a remarkable year. The sector's success was partly a rebound from the previous year's lackluster performance and partly fueled by investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Despite the strong showing in 2023, the communication services sector appears to have significant potential heading into 2024. By the end of 2023, valuations within the sector remained attractive, and positive shifts were observed in earnings estimates. Despite reaching record earnings and displaying momentum, stock prices in the sector had not yet returned to their previous peak levels.Fitch Ratings' 2024 outlook for the North American Telecommunications and Cable sector remains neutral. The sector shows a divergence, with large wireless and tower operators expected to de-lever, while some telecom and cable operators face competitive and secular challenges, along with increased debt costs. The sector is viewed as relatively resilient due to the essential nature of broadband and connectivity services. Despite potential risks like consumers opting for lower-priced services, wireless subscriber growth is anticipated, supported by implemented price increases. Fitch projects modest revenue growth and improved free cash flow for the sector in 2024-2025, with EBITDA margins expected to slightly improve. The decline in 5G-related capital expenditures is anticipated to drive an overall increase in aggregate free cash flow, allowing certain operators to focus on debt reduction in 2024.According to PwC, the telecommunications industry is grappling with a strategic challenge akin to mature industries, facing increased data consumption but limited pricing power in commoditized services. Despite a threefold increase in global data consumption by 2027, revenues from internet access are expected to grow modestly at a 4% CAGR to $921.6 billion. Telecommunications companies face significant investment needs, projected to spend $342.1 billion in 2027, particularly with the ongoing transition to 5G. PwC's Global Telecom Outlook suggests that, amid cost-cutting efforts, telcos can explore growth in areas like IoT solutions, private 5G networks, home broadband, and tailored digital services for sectors like entertainment, healthcare, manufacturing, and mobility. Adapting to broader ecosystems is seen as a strategic imperative in this evolving industry.Some of the best communication stocks to invest in according to hedge funds include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR). Our Methodology We chose the top communication stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). A skyscraper adorned with telecommunication equipment, symbolizing the industry.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) owns and manages wireless communication infrastructure, including towers, buildings, rooftops, distributed antenna systems, and small cells. The company has communication sites spread across the Americas, Africa, and the Philippines. It is one of the top communication stocks to invest in. On December 15, BMO raised its rating on SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) stock from Market Perform to Outperform. This shift is attributed to an appealing valuation for investors and a positive macroeconomic environment for tower REITs. Regarding valuation, SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) is currently traded at 18 times the estimated AFFO per share for 2024, representing what BMO perceives as a ""favorable opportunity to invest in a top-tier business with robust long-term growth potential.""According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) was part of 32 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 42 in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 1.3 million shares worth $262.6 million. Like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) is one of the best communication stocks to invest in. Baron Asset Fund made the following comment about SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“We reduced our stake in long-term holding SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC), which owns and operates cellular towers, on concerns that higher interest rates will increase its debt servicing costs and indications that its primary customers will spend less on upgrading their cellular networks.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. (NASDAQ:FYBR) delivers communication and technology services within the United States. Its offerings include data and Internet services, voice communication, video services, and other related services. It is one of the best communication stocks to buy. On February 5, Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. (NASDAQ:FYBR) disclosed that it is carrying out a formal strategic review process. The review encompasses an examination of optimizing operational and financing strategies, evaluating strategic partnerships, joint ventures, divestitures, mergers, and business combinations. This strategic review was prompted by activist Jana Partners, who urged an immediate assessment and potential sale of the company. Jana believes that Frontier's low valuation and strong presence in the fiber broadband sector could make it appealing to wireless carriers and private-equity-owned assets in the industry.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 40 hedge funds were long Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. (NASDAQ:FYBR), compared to 39 funds in the prior funds. Matthew Barrett’s Glendon Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 24.2 million shares worth $379 million. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) offers software and communication solutions in the United States and internationally. The company runs a cloud communications platform for developers to construct, expand, and manage customer engagement within software applications. Established in 2008, Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) is based in San Francisco, California. It is one of the top communication stocks to invest in. On January 8, Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) revealed the appointment of a new CEO and provided optimistic projections for the upcoming quarter. The company anticipates that the fourth-quarter guidance, initially disclosed on November 8, will surpass expectations. Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) foresees adjusted earnings in the range of 53 to 57 cents per share, coupled with a revenue outlook between $1.03 billion and $1.04 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 43 hedge funds were bullish on Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO), compared to 49 funds in the prior quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 8.6 million shares worth $505.6 million. Aristotle Atlantic Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We sold Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) and thereby reduced our subsector weight in software. The company reported a decent third quarter, but disappointed on fourth quarter 2022, full year 2023, and long-term guidance. The company is seeing macroeconomic headwinds and a slowdown spreading from technology, social media and cryptocurrency to retail and e-commerce. The other negative disclosure and a driver of this gross margin “miss” was that Twilio’s software sales are not accelerating at the rate that we expected. We are disappointed with this lower topline and low operating margin improvement guidance. The business transformation is taking longer than expected, and there is the heightened possibility that the new software growth could be stifled by more formidable competition as Twilio has made too many missteps.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is a global provider of telecommunications and technology services. The company offers wireless communication services, sells devices, and provides a range of data services to businesses, government entities, wholesale customers, and residential customers. It is one of the best communication stocks, ranking 8th on our list. On February 1, J.P. Morgan upgraded AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) based on expectations of sustained, long-term growth in both wireless and broadband segments. The primary source of growth is identified in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T)’s broadband division, particularly through its ongoing fiber buildout, which is seen as creating additional opportunities within existing markets, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Richard Choe. The analyst increased his rating to Overweight from Neutral and raised the year-end price target to $21 from $18.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 52 hedge funds were bullish on AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 22.6 million shares worth $340.7 million. Miller Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Our third-largest holding at quarter end was AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.AT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate. The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability, along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks, have us more excited about our portfolio’s prospects than we can remember for quite some time. As always, we remain the largest investors and welcome any questions or comments.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is engaged in the communications sector. The company provides a range of services such as data, wireless, video, and voice to residential and business customers in Alaska. The company, incorporated in 2014, is headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. It is one of the best communication stocks to invest in. On November 6, Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) reported Q3 GAAP earnings per share of $1.10 and a revenue of $240 million, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $2.05 and $14.5 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 52 hedge funds were long Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA), compared to 56 funds in the preceding quarter. Harris Associates is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 6.72 million shares worth $614.2 million. Madison Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“The bottom five detractors for the quarter were Arch Capital Group, Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA), Brown & Brown, Markel Group, and CarMax. Shares of Liberty Broadband, a holding company with a large investment in cable operator Charter Communications, were weak in the quarter as internet subscriber trends continue to disappoint. While the competitive environment is currently tough, we believe it will improve over time. Cable’s technology infrastructure is demonstrably superior, in both cost and performance, to what some of the legacy telecommunications carriers are currently rolling out in the form of “fixed wireless” broadband. Thus, their potential subscriber base is limited to a segment of the population base. We believe it likely therefore that the carriers will soon be limited in the competition they provide to Charter.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is a leading global real estate investment trust that owns, constructs, and operates multitenant communications real estate. The company owns a massive portfolio of communications sites and data center facilities in the United States.

Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 6.7 million shares worth more than $1 billion. Baron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Early in 2023, we sold the majority of our position in American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), a global operator of over 200,000 wireless towers, and even further reduced our modest position in the third quarter of 2023. We had concluded in late 2022 and early 2023 that growth expectations were too high given forthcoming headwinds from significantly higher financing costs (20%-plus exposure to floating rate debt), upcoming debt maturities, continued payment shortfalls from a key tenant in India, foreign exchange headwinds, and a reduction in mobile carrier capital expenditures.Following a sharp decline in American Tower’s shares in the first nine months of 2023, we began rebuilding our position because we believed that the company’s shares had become more attractively valued, growth headwinds were better understood, and the potential monetization event of its India business would ultimately be value accretive to its business. Further, we believe that 2023 will mark the trough in earnings growth for American Tower and growth should reaccelerate in the next few years.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) offers communication, technology, information, and entertainment services globally. The company operates through two segments – Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group.

(NYSE:VZ), compared to 53 funds in the earlier quarter. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP is the biggest position holder in the company, with a stake worth $218 million. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) ranks 6th on our list of the best communication stocks. Other hedge fund favorites include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR).Ariel Global Fund made the following comment about Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“By comparison, global communications and technology leader, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), continued to weigh on performance following an article in the Wall Street Journal outlining concerns on lead cable lines posing a significant public health threat. Although the lead covered cable lines remain an overhang on shares, we find Verizon’s valuation to be compelling. The company delivered a solid earnings report, with subscriber and financial metrics in-line or ahead of consensus. Management also reiterated full year guidance and noted it may exceed its outlook for free-cash-flow. From a competitive and financial standpoint, we view Verizon to be among one of the best positioned telecoms in the world. Looking forward, we expect free cash flow to grow significantly in the years ahead as the company moves past the secular peak in 5G capital spending.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Agriculture Stocks in 2024Dorsal Capital Partners Sees a 13% Boost in 2023: Its Top 15 Stock Picks10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners Disclosure: None. 12 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes"`['VZ', 'AMT', 'TWLO', 'T', 'SBAC', 'LBRDK', 'CHTR', 'TMUS']`

CVS chief medical officer: 'We are not looking to build the entire healthcare delivery ecosystem'`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cvs-chief-medical-officer-we-are-not-looking-to-build-the-entire-healthcare-delivery-ecosystem-164059258.html`2024-02-10 16:40:59`"The role of retail players in healthcare, like CVS (CVS), Walmart (WMT) and now Amazon (AMZN), is being closely watched by investors and clinicians alike.In its latest earnings, CVS emphasized a continued strategy in health services, even as competitor Walgreens (WBA) has signaled a pullback. Through its recent acquisitions of home health provider Signify, and primary care provider for seniors Oak Street, CVS is continuing to look for ways to create a closed loop for patients within its own system.""Oak Street ended the year with 202,000 at risk lives an increase of 27% versus the prior year. Through January, the number of Aetna members enrolled in Oak Street Clinic has doubled,"" said CEO Karen Lynch on the recent earnings call.""Signify completed 649,000 in-home evaluations in the quarter, an increase of 20% versus the same period last year. Among our Aetna customers, we are broadening our addressable market utilizing Signify's strong capabilities in other products, including individual exchange and Medicaid,"" Lynch said.Chief medical officer Sree Chaguturu told Yahoo Finance the company is ""building a world of health around every consumer.""""We are not looking to build the entire health care delivery ecosystem. But where we are choosing to build is where we believe there's the greatest opportunity to improve health outcomes. That's primary care, retail health, home services and physician enablement and accountable care — and that's helping physicians participate in value-based care,"" Chaguturu said in a recent, wide-ranging interview.When asked if those services step on the toes of legacy providers, like hospital systems and physician groups, by taking market share away from less complex cases, Chaguturu said it was the opposite.""These are the most complex patients in our healthcare ecosystem, with multiple chronic diseases, and in addition to the chronic illnesses, many aspects of social fragility and social determinants of need,"" he said.The company's recent earnings beat Wall Street expectations, reporting $93.8 billion in revenue for 2023, compared to an expected $90.7 billion. But it cut its 2024 outlook, expecting an expensive year ahead.That includes increased utilization costs for Aetna Medicare Advantage patients as delayed services from the pandemic continue to come back, and pharmacy benefits managers, like CVS Caremark, becoming a target for lawmakers in Congress who are looking at ways to reduce the power of such ""middlemen."" Typically, such middlemen are blamed for increased costs in the health ecosystem, but Chaguturu says they will help in the rush of use of weight loss drugs.The frenzy over GLP-1s, drugs that have been used for diabetics to help increase insulin production and help slow digestion, have been approved in the past few years for weight loss in obese patients.Though GLP-1s, named for the hormone in the body they mimic, are not new, the latest formulations have had record weight loss results. That has spurred a rush of interest ranging from patients to online health platforms looking to take advantage of the trend by offering prescriptions.Still, according to CVS, 80% of the prescriptions for the four top-selling drugs, from Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), are for Type 2 diabetes patients.Chaguturu said the PBMs will continue to drive down pricing to ensure access for more patients, and expects that more competition — which could begin as early as the end of this year — will also help drive down costs. CVS benefits by earning fees on the prescriptions of the drug it fills, as well as the rebates it gains from the drug manufacturers for covering the drugs and providing access to patients.But it isn't an unfettered gold rush. CVS is working with hesitant customers, like insurers and employers, who worry about the increased costs. The roughly $1,000-per-month GLP-1 drugs have caused some employers and insurers to stop covering them, or to require prior authorization in order to fill the prescription.That includes CVS's own insurer, Aetna, which told Yahoo Finance previously that, ""Prior authorization is required for coverage of these medications. This process allows our clinicians to review the request using evidence-based guidelines to ensure that coverage is appropriate given the member’s clinical status. The prior authorization process may include a review of the member’s age, body mass index, previous medical history and response to previous therapy.""CVS is also building clinical support for the employers and insurers, to ensure patients who get prescriptions actually need them, and then providing support to manage any side effects, according to Chaguturu.He said clients are taking a variety of approaches to GLP-1s, including waiting until prices come down, or until a way to ensure appropriate prescribing is in place, before agreeing to cover them.""In addition to bringing down pricing, we offer coverage and clinical solutions to help employers and health plans have access,"" he said.He expects new competitors on the scene, driving the ability to bring down pricing per prescription and net cost of prescription over the coming years.Anjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

Top 12 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-12-stocks-buy-10-152540880.html`2024-02-10 15:25:40`In this piece, we will take a look at the top 12 stocks to buy in 10 different sectors for the next 3 months. If you want to skip our introduction to how spreading a portfolio across several sectors might help long term performance according to financial literature, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months.The spread of technology and the broad use of the Internet by people belonging to all walks of life has significantly increased the exposure that people have to information. This is true for politics, sports, and finance - as both those who work in these industries and others whose well being is tied to their performance are able to stay abreast with the latest developments. Social media stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and private companies like Elon Musk's well known X (formerly called Twitter) enable a connected world and a much well informed global populace.For instance, if you're interested to learn from those who spend the better part of their day dabbling in all things finance, then you can always consult Twitter. Diverse viewpoints are important when it comes to risking money on stocks, and another common way of hedging an investment portfolio's risk is through diversification as well. In finance theory, diversification reduces the variance that a broader portfolio's returns might face. In other words, it reduces the wild downswings that might significantly reduce principal value in case of an untoward event in one industry, providing investors with peace of mind and better chances of optimal cardiovascular performance.Additionally, the sheer plethora of information available to investors through the Internet and traditional media also allows them to rapidly tailor and trim their investments in response to news. For instance, it takes mere seconds for all major stock indexes such as the NASDAQ, the S&P 500, and the NYSE to fall when the Federal Reserve surprises investors by beefing up interest rates, or rise when macroeconomic and political stability is assured. When it comes to investing in stocks that belong to different sectors, a well-informed investor is easily able to keep up to date with the performance of sectors that are completely different from each other such as high technology biotechnology stocks and good old oil crude oil exploration and production stocks.Even if we were to ignore complex mathematical complications of standard deviation and other variables that professionals rely on when investing in stocks in different sectors, doing so also seems to make sense on an intuitive scale. For instance, let's consider two different sectors and recent stock market events to see how this might work. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and the Federal Reserve started to increase interest rates in response to record inflation levels, the bifurcation of the stock market into different sectors became clear. We've briefly mentioned one of these, i.e., oil and energy, above, and the second sector is technology. After the Russian invasion and the official settling in of the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate hiking cycle, oil stocks soared as investors correctly realized that they would benefit from a shakeup in the global oil industry.At the same time, tight macroeconomic conditions created by high interest rates and high inflation meant that big ticket technology and high growth stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted double or even triple digit percentage losses on the stock market. For the investor who was prudent enough to have invested in different sectors at the start of 2022, the juicy returns and dividends offered by oil stocks would have helped ease or even reverse the pain that technology stocks experienced in 2022.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top stocks in different sectors. The notable picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Photo by Sunrise King on UnsplashOur Methodology To make our list of the stocks to buy in different sectors, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge fund portfolios and picked out stocks from Technology, Materials, Real Estate, Financial Services, Healthcare, Industrial, Communications, Consumer Cyclical, Consumer Defensive, Utilities, and Energy sectors with the highest hedge fund shareholders as of Q3 2023.

Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Do Its Financials Have Any Role To Play In Driving Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Stock Up Recently?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/financials-role-play-driving-amazon-120024420.html`2024-02-10 12:00:24`"Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 22% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Amazon.com's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Amazon.com The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:15% = US$30b ÷ US$202b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit.We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.To begin with, Amazon.com seems to have a respectable ROE. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 19% does temper our expectations. However, the moderate 5.7% net income growth seen by Amazon.com over the past five years is definitely a positive. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the fairly high earnings growth seen by the company.As a next step, we compared Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 13% in the same period.Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is AMZN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether AMZN is currently mispriced by the market.Amazon.com doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.Overall, we feel that Amazon.com certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a respectable rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

‘Riding High’: Evercore Suggests 2 Top Franchise Auto Dealer Stocks to Buy Now`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/riding-high-evercore-suggests-2-162137720.html`2024-02-01 16:21:37`Americans have a long-lasting love affair with cars, and it shows in the economy. The automotive industry accounts for approximately 3% of the nation’s GDP, and car sales are a huge business. In its mid-2023 report, the National Auto Dealers Association reported that 16,839 franchised dealers had sold 7.66 million light-duty vehicles (cars and light trucks) in 1H23. Total dealer sales in light-duty vehicles for the half-year came to $614 billion and that was supplemented by $73 billion worth of service and parts orders.In addition to its footprint, the franchise auto dealer sector benefits from structural defenses against economic downturns. While auto dealers are generally synonymous with new car sales, their business is highly diversified. They engage in used car sales, finance, credit, insurance services, parts, and repairs. Typically, new car sales account for only 25% to 30% of a franchise dealer’s gross profits.Keeping this background in mind, in a recent sector report, Evercore analyst and automotive expert Doug Dutton lays out reasons to be optimistic about the segment. “We are constructive on the entire Franchise Auto Dealer sector, and both securities, for different reasons,” said the analyst. “Our multi-year normalization thesis centers around Auto sales volumes (New/Used), upcoming ‘rate of change trough’ on Gross Profit per Unit, and capital allocation priorities while these growing businesses continue to expand their footprints and build scale across the US.”Specifically, Dutton has tagged two auto dealer stocks for investors to buy now, and both have Buy ratings from the rest of the Street as well, according to the TipRanks data. Let’s take a closer look.Lithia Motors (LAD)First on the list is Lithia Motors, one of the largest automotive dealer groups in the US. The Oregon-based company has 290 dealerships in the US, plus another 14 in Canada and 40 more in the UK. The company’s US business boasts 58,425 new cars on the lots, along with 32,131 pre-owned vehicles and another 5,470 certified pre-owned cars; in Canada, the company has some 1,000 cars on the lots, and in the UK, approximately 3,000.The company’s heavy exposure to used cars has been an advantage in recent years, despite volatility in the used car markets. Prices for pre-owned vehicles, while down from one-year ago, remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels; according to industry experts, prices for used cars are up by an average of 50% when compared to 2019.For customers, Lithia offers a wide range of vehicle brands and nameplates. Buys can find venerable names from the Motor City – Ford, Dodge, Chevy – along with imports from Japan and Korea – Nissan and Kia – and even high-end luxury names like Maserati and Rolls Royce.Lithia will announce its results for 4Q23, and the full year 2023, this coming February 14, but a look at the last results, from 3Q23, will give an idea where the firm currently stands. Revenue in the quarter came to $8.3 billion, an increase of 13% from the $7.3 billion reported in 3Q22 – and it beat the forecast by $130 million. The company’s adj. EPS was reported as $9.25, a figure that missed the forecast by 82 cents per share. Looking forward, the expectations for the upcoming 4Q report include revenue at $7.95 billion and earnings at $8.27 per share.For Evercore’s Dutton, the story here revolves around Lithia’s solid position in the car sales niche, and its ability to continue its expansion. He writes of the company, “Lithia, like most dealers, is levered to US SAAR (seasonally adjusted annual rate), but also has an idiosyncratic ‘kicker’ in the form of its online platform leadership and aggressive mid-decade expansion goals… The level of belief in US consumer/SAAR strength and Lithia’s ability to execute and keep the M&A pipeline flowing will shape investor sentiment on the equity… LAD’s strong dealmaking ability where dealer testimonials point to a smooth & efficient changeover process allows it to engineer strong EPS growth, helping to reach goal of $50/share in ’25 and $2 of EPS per $1Bn in revenue by late-decade.”These comments support Dutton’s Outperform (Buy) rating, and his $400 price target points toward a one-year upside potential of 35.5%. (To watch Dutton’s track record, click here)Wall Street gives Lithia’s stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 7 recent analyst reviews that include 4 Buys to 3 Holds. The shares are priced at $294.85 and their $351.14 average price target implies an upside of 19% in the next 12 months. (See Lithia’s stock forecast)AutoNation (AN)The second Evercore pick we’ll look at is AutoNation, a company that – like Lithia above – is a perennial member of the ‘top 5’ in US automotive dealer networks. The company has a market cap just over $6 billion and boasts a network of some 300 dealer locations spread across 20 states. AutoNation was founded in 1996 and in 2011 became the first US dealer network to sell a total of 8 million vehicles. AutoNation has sold over 14 million vehicles since its founding.AutoNation’s business is split into four main segments: new vehicles, used vehicles, after-sales, and customer financial services. The largest of these is new vehicles, which makes up approximately 46% of the company’s total business. Used vehicles make up just under 32% of AutoNation’s work, while the remainder is split between after-sales and financial services.The company’s most recent financial statement, from 3Q23, showed beats on both the top-and bottom-line. Revenues hit $6.9 billion. This was up 3% from the prior-year period, and was $190 million over the estimates. The company reported a non-GAAP EPS of $5.54, down from the $6.31 in 3Q22, although it beat the forecast by 4 cents per share. AutoNation’s new vehicle revenue was up 11% in the quarter, and used vehicle revenue was up 10%.AutoNation is expected to release its 4Q23 figures in the middle of the month, and the forecast calls for revenues of $6.69 billion supporting an EPS of $4.94. For comparison, the 4Q22 numbers came to $6.7 billion in revenue and $6.37 in adjusted EPS.Analyst Dutton likes AutoNation for its combination of various factors. He writes of the stock, “AutoNation is operating as a more mature business with less inorganic growth and higher ROE/ROA, while continuing to return significant capital to shareholders (AN could buyback >75% of current stock with FCF through end of decade). The stock trades at a 1pt multiple discount to LAD for this reason (~6.5x vs ~7.5x P/E), and while solid earnings should continue with 5%+ organic EPS growth, we are constructive on AN for different reasons given the divergent growth profile (Rev only growing from $26Bn ’22 to $28Bn ’25 with EBIT down).”Getting down to the brass tacks, Dutton gives these shares an Outperform rating, and a $185 price target that implies a 12-month share appreciation of nearly 32.5%.Looking at the Street’s view of AutoNation, we find that the analysts have given the stock 6 recent reviews – with a 4 to 2 breakdown favoring Buy over Hold, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. These shares are trading for $139.66, and their $181.50 average price target suggests an upside of 30% on the one-year horizon.

AutoNation Stock (NYSE:AN): Bearish Options Traders are Ignoring This Catalyst`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/autonation-stock-nyse-bearish-options-210344132.html`2024-01-22 21:03:44`With American households still facing a daunting environment of elevated inflation and high borrowing costs, targeting automotive retailer AutoNation (NYSE:AN) might not seem to be a particularly bright idea. Unsurprisingly, bearish traders in both the open and options market imply that long-side speculators could get smoked. However, the company may drive higher on an underappreciated catalyst. Combined with the potential for short-covering activities, AN stock could fly higher, making me bullish.Although demand for certain high-ticket items fell last year, not every entity suffered the same magnitude of pain. Some investments, such as AN stock, actually saw positive returns — in this case, a lift of almost 22% in the past 52 weeks. That might seem odd, given the tough circumstances that consumers find themselves in. However, certain factors could eventually favor the auto retailer.First, many market participants expect the Federal Reserve to reduce the interest rates later this year. To be fair, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report clouds this narrative. If the labor force remains robust, this dynamic would translate to more dollars chasing after fewer goods. That’s not exactly a great framework for lowering borrowing costs.Still, it’s impossible to know with absolute certainty what might happen in the future. Should rates decline, as the Fed hinted at last month, buying expensive items will likely be far less onerous. According to data from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the finance rate for 60-month loans for new vehicles shot up to 8.15% in November 2023.In February 2022, that rate was at 4.52%. Unsurprisingly, total vehicle sales began conspicuously falling since June of last year. Potentially, reduced borrowing costs could reinvigorate sentiment, thus lifting AN stock.Second and more importantly, consumers may have little choice in the matter. In 2023, the average age of vehicles on U.S. roadways hit 12.5 years, a fresh record. At some point, even the most reliable cars will incur mechanical issues. Financially, it just might make more sense to find a replacement vehicle rather than keep repairing a money pit.If lower interest rates become the norm, consumers may view purchasing a vehicle as a no-brainer, benefiting AutoNation.Nevertheless, the implied pessimism in the options market represents a warning shot to those considering buying AN stock. In particular, TipRanks’ screener for unusual options activity shows several transactions with bearish implications. Typically, these trades revolve around bought puts, which give holders the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying security at the listed strike price.However, pessimists can also take a more daring approach with sold (written) calls. In particular, two bearish call option transactions – 400 contracts of the AN Feb 16 ’24 160.00 call and 410 contracts of the AN Feb 16 ’24 165.00 call – warrant close attention. Both transactions occurred on January 10.In summary, these traders are betting that AN stock won’t rise materially above the $160 and $165 strike prices by the February 16 deadline. If AN fails to do so, the bearish trader can potentially collect the maximum premium, that is, the funds received for selling the aforementioned contracts.Of course, the risk centers on AN stock possibly moving higher instead of lower. For example, if AutoNation drives up to $200, the bearish trader is contractually obligated to fulfill the underlying terms upon exercise: sell AN shares at $160 and $165. Therefore, the loss comes out as the difference between what the shares could have been sold for versus the strike price minus the premium.In addition, if the written calls were uncovered, the bearish trader must buy AN stock at the open market price and sell it at the lower strike price. Therefore, uncovered short calls expose participating traders to uncapped loss potential, adding pressure to the situation.Finally, the bears are also betting against AN stock directly. Currently, AutoNation’s short interest as a percentage of its float stands at 11.93%. Also, the short interest ratio comes in at 13.15 days to cover. If AutoNation jumps higher for any reason, a short-covering panic could erupt, leading to significant upside.Notably, Autonation stock’s financials are surprisingly resilient, as the company has been posting profits every year. Perhaps most conspicuously, even in the pandemic-disrupted year of 2020, the company posted operating income of $939 million and net income of $381.6 million. Surely, the business has undertones of discretionary sentiment. At the same time, many people need personal transportation, thus making the service a necessity.It’s also hard to ignore the discount at play. At the moment, shares trade at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 6x. However, the sector average for the auto and truck dealership segment comes in at 9.71x. With many elements working in favor of the bullish thesis, the bears are probably feeling the heat.Turning to Wall Street, AN stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, two Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average AN price target is $181.83, implying 26.9% upside potential.At first glance, the tough challenges that American households face don’t make AutoNation an enticing bullish idea. However, with cars on roadways becoming increasingly older, consumers must start considering buying replacements. That’s a catalyst that bearish traders (both in the open market and the options market) could be ignoring, setting up a potentially lucrative showdown for optimists. On top of that, the stock’s low valuation provides extra support to the bulls.DisclosureRelated Quotes`['AN']`

At US$139, Is It Time To Put AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) On Your Watch List?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-139-time-put-autonation-150523412.html`2024-01-18 15:05:23`While AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$152 and falling to the lows of US$128. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether AutoNation's current trading price of US$139 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at AutoNation’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for AutoNation Great news for investors – AutoNation is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 5.43x is currently well-below the industry average of 13.4x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. However, given that AutoNation’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of AutoNation, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -20%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Are you a shareholder? Although AN is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. We recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to AN, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor?

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ANF for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Abercrombie & Fitch's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Abercrombie & Fitch's main business drivers.Abercrombie & Fitch Co. operates as a specialty retailer of premium, high-quality casual apparel for men, women, and kids through a network of approximately 759 stores across North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, as well as the e-commerce sites www.abercrombie.com, www.abercrombiekids.com, www.hollisterco.com, www.gillyhicks.com and www.socialtourist.com.Abercrombie's product portfolio includes knit and woven shirts, graphic T-shirts, fleece, jeans and woven pants, shorts, sweaters, outerwear, personal care products and accessories for men, women and kids, under the Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie kids and Hollister brands.Additionally, the company sells inner wear, personal care products, sleepwear and at-home products for girls through direct-to-consumer operations and Hollister stores under the Gilly Hicks brand. It also sells products through its e-commerce platform.In the fiscal second quarter, the company reorganized its structure. It will now report under three geographical segments, namely Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia-Pacific (APAC). All prior periods presented have been altered to conform to this reclassification. Brand-wise, Abercrombie reports in two segments - Abercrombie and Hollister.Abercrombie (49.5% of the net sales in the third quarter) includes the Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands. Abercrombie & Fitch, targeted at the college-going crowd, is positioned as a luxury lifestyle concept that uses the finest materials to create high-quality casual wear. abercrombie kids, themed as ""classic cool"", is aimed at pre-teens and is the children's version of Abercrombie & Fitch.Hollister (50.5%) is based on a South California theme, and targets youth in their late teens.

Capri Holdings (CPRI) Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates, Decline Y/Y`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/capri-holdings-cpri-q3-earnings-132300138.html`2024-02-09 13:23:00`Capri Holdings Limited CPRI came up with third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also declined on a year-over-year basis. Softness in demand for luxury fashion items hurt the company’s performance. While Capri Holdings continued to face challenges in the wholesale channel, the retail outlets performed better.Impressively, Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors brands continued to resonate well with consumers. Better customer engagement resulted in the addition of 10.7 million new consumers joining the database, marking 13% growth compared to the last year.This designer, marketer, distributor and retailer of branded apparel and accessories posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.20 per share, showcasing a decline from the adjusted earnings of $1.84 reported in the year-ago period. Also, the metric fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74.Total revenues of $1,427 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,474 million and decreased 5.6% year over year. On a constant-currency basis, total revenues declined 6.6%.The adjusted gross profit decreased approximately 7.5% year over year to $928 million. The adjusted gross margin contracted 130 basis points to 65% due to lower full-price sell-throughs.Adjusted operating expenses increased 1.2% year over year to $756 million. The metric, as a percentage of total revenues, rose by 360 basis points to 53%.The company reported an adjusted operating income of $172 million, down from $256 million in the prior year’s quarter. The adjusted operating margin shrunk 480 basis points to 12.1%. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including a soft gross margin, an unfavorable channel mix, increased store-related costs and expense deleverage resulting from lower revenues.Capri Holdings Limited price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Capri Holdings Limited QuoteRevenues from Versace decreased 8.8% year over year to $227 million during the quarter. The decline stemmed from sluggish consumer demand in the Americas and EMEA regions, partly mitigated by higher revenues in Asia. Retail sales experienced a low-single-digit decline, while wholesale revenues saw a double-digit decrease. Revenues dropped 14% and 13% in the Americas and EMEA, respectively, but improved 10% in Asia. Versace's global database expanded by 1.5 million new entries, indicating remarkable 25% growth compared to the previous year.Jimmy Choo’s revenues came in at $166 million, down 1.2% from the prior-year period. The decline was due to a slowdown in consumer demand, particularly in the Americas. However, this was partially offset by higher revenues in Asia. Retail sales remained relatively stable, while wholesale revenues saw a mid-single-digit decrease. Specifically, revenues in the Americas dropped 11%, while in the EMEA, the metric remained unchanged. Revenues in Asia grew 9%. Additionally, Jimmy Choo's global database expanded by 0.7 million new entries, marking notable 13% growth compared to the previous year.Revenues from Michael Kors fell 5.6% year over year to $1,034 million. This decline can be attributed to a softening consumer demand, particularly in the Americas. Furthermore, the results were affected by the implementation issues with the Michael Kors Americas E-commerce platform discussed in the preceding quarter. However, as expected, improvements in E-commerce trends in the Americas began to materialize in the third quarter following functional changes aimed at addressing the issues.Retail sales experienced a mid-single-digit decline, while wholesale revenues decreased in the low double digits. Specifically, revenues in the Americas dropped by 7%, while in the EMEA, the metric fell 2%. Revenues in Asia declined 2%. Michael Kors' global database expanded by 8.5 million new entries, representing significant 12% growth compared to the previous year.Capri Holdings ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $249 million, long-term debt of $1,383 million and total shareholders’ equity of $1,935 million.As of Dec 30, 2023, Capri Holdings had 1,270 retail stores.

Under Armour (UAA) Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Fall Y/Y`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/under-armour-uaa-q3-earnings-155100152.html`2024-02-08 15:51:00`Under Armour, Inc. UAA came up with third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and dropped year over year. Conversely, the company’s bottom line exceeded the consensus estimate and showcased an increase from the year-ago period.The Baltimore-based company reported adjusted earnings of 19 cents a share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents. The figure increased from the adjusted earnings of 16 cents a share reported in the year-ago period.Meanwhile, net revenues of $1,486.1 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,507 million and decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis. The metric declined 7% on a currency-neutral basis.Wholesale revenues declined 13% to $712 million, while direct-to-consumer revenues saw a 4% increase, reaching $741 million. This growth stemmed from a 5% rise in revenues from owned and operated stores, coupled with a 2% increase in e-commerce revenues. E-commerce revenues accounted for 45% of the total direct-to-consumer business during the quarter.AUnder Armour, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteBy product category, Apparel revenues edged down 5.5% year over year to $1,016.7 million, while Footwear revenues decreased 6.6% to $331 million. Revenues from the Accessories category fell 0.3% to $104.5 million. Meanwhile, Licensing revenues dropped 2.2% to $29.1 million.Net revenues from North America declined 11.8% to $915.4 million.

Revenues from the Asia-Pacific rose 7.1% to $212 million, while revenues from the Latin American region grew 9.4% to $69.8 million.The company’s gross margin expanded 100 basis points to 45.2% from the prior-year period, largely propelled by supply chain efficiencies resulting in reduced freight costs. However, this gain was partly offset by strategic inventory management measures, such as higher sales to the off-price channel and increased promotional efforts within the direct-to-consumer segment.Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 4% to $579.2 million. Adjusted operating income came in at $92 million, down from $95 million reported in the year-ago period.Under Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,040.1 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $595.1 million and total stockholders' equity of $2,173 million. For fiscal 2024, management expects capital expenditures between $210 million and $230 million.During the quarter, the company repurchased Class C shares worth $25 million. As of Dec 31, 45.6 million shares for $500 million had been bought back, concluding the two-year program approved in February 2022.Under Armour now anticipates a revenue decrease of 3% to 4%. It had earlier projected a decline of 2% to 4%.The gross margin is projected to rise 120 to 130 basis points, marking an upward revision from the previous expectation of a 100 to 125 basis point increase. Management foresees SG&A expenses to be flat to down slightly.Operating income is projected to range between $287 million and $297 million. Excluding the impact of the company's litigation reserve, adjusted operating income is anticipated to be $310 million to $320 million.Under Armour anticipates earnings to fall within the range of 57-59 cents per share, including a 12-cent after-tax benefit from the final earn-out related to the sale of the MyFitnessPal platform and a five-cent negative impact of the litigation reserve. Excluding these net positive impacts totaling 7 cents, the company foresees adjusted earnings between 50 and 52 cents per share.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has advanced 7.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rise of 13.3%.Here, we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Abercrombie & Fitch ANF, American Eagle Outfitters AEO and Deckers Outdoor Corporation DECK.Abercrombie & Fitch, an omnichannel specialty retailer of apparel and accessories for men, women and kids, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-retail-wholesale-stocks-could-140006084.html`2024-02-06 14:00:06`Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.30 a share, just 28 days from its upcoming earnings release on March 5, 2024.DKS has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.17%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $3.30 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.29.DKS is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) as well.Abercrombie & Fitch, which is readying to report earnings on March 6, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.82 a share, and ANF is 29 days out from its next earnings report.For Abercrombie & Fitch, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.71 is 4.34%.DKS and ANF's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, as well as having been posted on our website.Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.Greg Case: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We want to start with a very sincere thank you to our Aon colleagues around the world for all they've done in 2023 pivotal for our clients and support each other. As we reflect on 2023, we observed that the client demand driving our Aon United journey. Trends around increasing volatility and interconnected risk have accelerated. Specifically, we see four broad areas of focus that increase the relevance of our core business and create opportunity to deliver more value to clients. These four megatrends revolve around trade and the consequence of sustained geopolitical uncertainty.Technology, particularly the rise of AI, weather reflecting the rate of natural catastrophes and workforce where the pandemic has fundamentally impacted talent. These profound transitions described in our Global Risk Management Survey and Human Capital Trends Report require clients to both deliver against today's expectations and evolve to make better decisions on new risk and people challenges. Against that backdrop, we've taken significant steps to accelerate our Aon United strategy in ways that drove performance in 2023 and set the stage to build momentum and deliver stronger performance in 2024. Most notably, we're executing our three-by-three plan to leverage our risk capital and human capital structure and capability, embed the Aon Client leadership model across the firm and utilize Aon Business Services to set a new standard of innovation and client service.We then doubled down on this plan by announcing a $900 million investment into our business to accelerate Aon Business Services as a catalyst for the three-by-three plan and the complete workforce strategy effort to reflect our simplified and more connected go-to-market strategy. We closed the year with strong operating momentum and also took action to build upon our ABS driven capability to deliver innovative and accretive new products into the middle-market by announcing our intent to acquire NFP. NFP under the leadership of Doug Hammond and an exceptional team is the premier operating platform in the middle-market segment with tremendous client relationships and distribution. And together, we can bring stronger analytics and innovation to this space and not just capability but content that can serve the middle market like Aon Cyber Quotient Evaluation or CyQI, a proprietary platform that helps clients identify, measure and manage cyber risk.NFP's operating platform will enable quick and efficient connections to Aon Business Services content driving meaningful growth in the middle market. And we're incredibly excited about the top and bottom-line growth potential for NFP, given our complementary businesses and expected synergies and the value it will create. For Aon overall and barely one month into 2024, we already feel the momentum from these actions that's demonstrated through the client benefits of our integrated risk capital and human capital capabilities. On the risk capital side, our recent weather, climate, and catastrophe report highlights the growing frequency and severity of events around the world as clients look to manage volatility, enhance resilience and unlock opportunity.To do this, organizations must have more actionable analytics, exactly the insight we bring with risk capital through the combined power of reinsurance, commercial risk analytics and expertise for our clients. We recently saw this in action at our Annual Property symposium with over 1,000 clients in insurance markets in the room where we demonstrated a new suite of advanced analytic tools that bring together content and capability across reinsurance and commercial risk. One example is our property risk analyzer giving clients a better understanding of the risk profile in real time, which allows us to work more closely together to provide better insight into the risk mitigation options and enable them to make better decisions. From the overwhelming feedback and engagement, it's clear our clients are demanding better solutions and greater support.And because of the steps we've taken and progress we've made with Aon Business Services on products and platforms, we can develop and roll these tools out more quickly for our largest clients, and the clients of all sizes deliver efficiently at scale. Equally compelling for Human Capital, our Human Capital trends report highlights the rising importance to clients, but having a unique and differentiated value proposition for employees. We see clients facing significant rising healthcare costs and lower overall population health at a time they need to provide broad health and well-being offerings is greater than ever. We also saw attracting and retaining top talent as the fourth ranked risk in our Global Risk Management Survey. Our clients realize it's more important than ever to have a compelling strategy across health, wealth and talent needs that's delivered in an efficient way to maximize the benefit rewards offering.Together, this creates significant opportunity to work with clients to design and optimize their programs including core offerings to improve colleague health. Our operations drive workers' compensation costs, choosing optimal partners in their health model and supporting top talent is a strong employee value proposition, to ultimately maximize return on investment or their people spend. All these are examples of our three-by-three plan in action. It's human capital and risk capital delivered through our Aon Client leadership model and enabled by our Aon Business Services. These three pillars reinforce and accelerate our Aon United strategy, which has driven financial performance and gives us great confidence in our outlook. On financial performance, we delivered strong results in the quarter that contribute to full-year progress against our key financial metrics.Organic revenue growth of 7% in the quarter and 7% for the full-year was highlighted by full-year double-digit growth in reinsurance solutions and health solutions. And we've maintained strong overall growth throughout the year on top of 6% organic in the prior year. In the fourth quarter, commercial risk grew 4% organically with strength in property, casualty and construction even against the headwind communicated in prior quarters of ongoing pressure from trends in the M&A and IPO markets. Wealth solutions, organic growth of 5% in Q4 reflects strong growth in retirement, which includes growth from ongoing pension risk transfer projects and work to help clients address changing regulatory requirements. Reinsurance solutions organic growth was 14% contributing to full-year organic growth of 10% with our team closed the year strong, while also helping clients prepare for and execute an early one-one renewal.Health solutions delivered 11% organic growth, reflecting the strength around the world in the core, driven by net new business and retention, as well as strong growth in the U.S. consumer benefit solutions. This performance gives us confidence in our ability to drive ongoing growth across the portfolio, fully reflecting the strength of Aon United. For the full-year, 7% organic growth and ongoing operational improvement contributed to 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth. These strong results demonstrate our progress and momentum, as well as the power of Aon United strategy and Aon Business Services platform. This performance builds on our long-term track-record of results. Over the past 12 years, we've strengthened and accelerated organic revenue growth to mid-single digits or greater, delivered over 400 basis points of adjusted operating margin, expansion and growth in EPS and free-cash flow at 11% compounded annual rate ending 2023 with nearly $3.2 billion in free cash flow.The steps we've taken to accelerate Aon United with our three-by-three plan reinforce and strengthen our long-term financial guidance for the firm including mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth in 2024 and over the long-term, adjusted operating margin expansion over the long-term and long-term double-digit free-cash flow growth. As we've communicated initiatives like our restructuring program and expected acquisition of NFP impact this guidance in the near-term and over time, we believe these initiatives will contribute to significant ongoing shareholder value creation. More important we view the opportunity is higher over the next five years than at any time in our history. And in closing, we're pleased to report another strong year of progress against our Aon United strategy, which we're accelerating with our three-by-three plan, deliver risk capital and human capital at scale fully reinforced through Aon Business Services.Looking back on a year, we delivered accelerating growth across three or four solution lines and built momentum across the firm. Including 7% full-year organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, 10% adjusted operating income growth and nearly $3.2 billion of free cash flow. Equally important, we took a series of major actions that position Aon for stronger performance in 2024 and over the coming years. Now. I would like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and long term outlook. Christa?Christa Davies: Thanks so much Greg, and good morning everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered strong operating results in the fourth quarter to finish the year strong. In the quarter, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth. The full year 2023, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of margin expansion, 6% EPS growth and generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. In the quarter, we announced out definitive agreement to acquire leading broker NFP, enabling us to unlock the fast-growing mid-markets with Aon Business Services enabled enhanced distribution and further accelerate our Aon United strategy. The steps that we've taken around Aon Business Services now enables us to address this attractive market in a compelling way that delivers risk capital and human capital at scale to clients of all sizes.The expected acquisition of NFP builds on our long-term proven track record of strategically allocating capital at scale to high return opportunities to create long-term value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. And as Greg mentioned, we see the expected acquisition and our restructuring program, reinforcing our Aon United Strategy and our three-by-three plan. We are extremely well-positioned to build on this momentum as we head into 2024. As I reflect on our results, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 7% in Q4 and for the full-year, highlighted by double-digit organic revenue growth in Reinsurance Solutions and Health Solutions. I would note that reported revenue growth of 8% in Q4 includes this favorable impact from changes in FX of 2%, and there is no net impact from changes in FX to full-year reported revenue.I'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth, was $78 million in Q4 and $274 million for the full-year. If you were to include fiduciary investment income, organic revenue growth would have been 8% in both Q4 and the full-year. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full-year 2024 and over the long-term. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement in Q4 with adjusted operating margins of 33.8%, an increase of 60 basis-points, driven by revenue growth, efficiencies from Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investment in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth. For the full-year, adjusted operating margins of 31.6% reflect margin expansion of 80 basis points.As previously communicated, there was no impact on margin from restructuring savings. Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2024 and over the long-term, as we continue our track-record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on ROIC basis. We expect restructuring savings will fall to the bottom-line and contribute to full-year adjusted operating margin expansion. Restructuring actions completed in 2023 are expected to generate $70 million of run-rate savings in 2024. At this time, we continue to expect a $100 million of run-rate savings in 2024 as we continue to execute against our plans at Aon Business Services and our business. As we've previously communicated, we conservatively modeled the expected acquisition of NFP to close mid-year 2025.While the combined adjusted operating margin will initially be lower than Aon standalone, we expect over time to continue to improve Aon's overall margins through operational improvement and the impacts from previously communicated cost synergies. Turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was flat in Q4. Operating income grew 10%, but was offset by a headwind from a higher tax-rate in the quarter and non-operating expense. For the full-year, organic revenue growth and margin expansion translated into adjusted EPS growth of 6%, overcoming a headwind from non-operating expense. I'd note, the change in other non-operating expense had a $0.15 per share or 4% unfavorable impact in Q4 and a $0.98 per share or 7% unfavorable impact for the full-year. This reflects an unfavorable impact from balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period, an increase in non-cash net periodic pension expense, as well as a gain on sale of businesses in the prior year period.Also, as noted in our earnings materials, FX translation had a favorable impact or approximately $0.03 per share in Q4 and an unfavorable impact of $0.17 per share for the full-year. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no material net translation impact results for the full-year 2024. Additionally, in 2024 we expect non-cash pension expense NOI to be $43 million, spread evenly across quarters, compared to $71 million in 2023. And as we've previously communicated based on a mid-2025 close, the expected acquisition of NFP is expected to be dilutive in 2025, breakeven to adjusted 2026 EPS and accretive in 2027 and beyond. At this time, there are no further updates on the regulatory process or deal timeline for NFP. Turning to free-cash flow, we generated $3.3 billion of free-cash flow in 2023.For the full-year, cash from operations increased $216 million Year-over-Year, or 7%, reflecting double-digit operating income growth and overall working capital optimization, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. I'd note, the negative impact to working capital, caused by temporary invoicing delays associated with the new system implementation, which we communicated last quarter persisted in Q4 and impacted our overall continued progress on working capital. Free-cash flow increased 5% as cash-flow from operations was offset in-part by a $56 million or 29% increase in CapEx. CapEx was $252 million in 2023 as we executed technology projects to drive long-term growth. Going forward, we expect CapEx to grow in-line with the business managed on a disciplined ROIC basis.Looking forward, free-cash flow will be impacted in the near-term by restructuring, higher interest expense and the expected NFP deal and integration costs. We expect to return to our trajectory of double-digit free-cash flow growth over the long-term, driven by operating income growth and a $500 million opportunity in working capital. As we contemplate the expected acquisition of NFP, the transaction strengthens our long-term free-cash flow outlook. We expect the transaction to add over $300 million of free-cash flow in 2026 and $600 million of free-cash flow in 2027. Now let me provide an update on our accelerating Aon United program which is enabling Aon Business Services and our three-by-three plan. As Greg highlighted, three-by-three plan is accelerating our Aon United strategy.We see particular opportunity around Aon Business Services as the catalyst. We are investing to standardized platforms and operations, drive data analytic-based product innovation and deliver at scale to create better tools, better experiences and greater relevance to clients and colleagues. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a $129 million of restructuring-related charges with a cash outflow of $13 million. We're pleased with the progress we made in the quarter and we've incurred 12% of total expected cash restructuring charges. The actions we've taken in 2023 are expected to generate $70 million of run-rate savings in 2024, contributing to the $100 million of cumulative savings we expect for full-year 2024. As mentioned, program savings were not material in 2023.As we've said previously, we look at the opportunity in Aon Business Services and across our client-facing capabilities. We now are delivering our strategy will result in long-term progress against our key financial metrics and will drive more value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. Turning now to capital allocation. We allocate capital based on return on capital and long-term value creation. I'd note, over time, we've driven value creation through core business results, share buyback and acquisitions. As you look historically, we have a successful track record of balancing acquisitions and dispositions of all sizes and share buyback. Given our strong outlook for free-cash flow over the long-term, we expect share repurchases to continue to remain our highest-return on capital opportunity for meaningful ongoing capital allocation.We believe we are significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the $2.7 billion of share repurchase in 2023. We expect to continue to invest organically in content and capabilities we can scale across the firm and we'll continue to assess priority as inorganic investments noting our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our global priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. Noting we ended 2023 with an ROIC of 33.1%, an increase of nearly 2,100 basis-points over the last 12 years, reflecting our track record of balancing growth and returns to create long-term value. I'd note ROIC will initially be negatively impacted after the expected acquisition of NFP.We expect it to improve over time as we execute our Aon United strategy to drive long-term value creation. Our expected acquisition of NFP is consistent with our proven capital allocation framework. It enables us to put capital to work at-scale and strengthen our free-cash flow profile in the long-term, which will continue to allocate to drive shareholder value creation. Between now and the expected close of the deal, we expect discretionary capital allocation will continue to be much more weighted towards share buyback, given the commitments we've made around NFP. Following the expected close of NFP, free-cash flow will be impacted in the near-term by deal and integration costs and higher interest expense, transaction-related debt, and as we take steps to delever our balance sheet and return metrics to levels consistent with our current credit ratings profile.Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade credit ratings. We expect to continue adding debt supported by EBITDA growth until we complete the expected acquisition of NFP and expect to maintain our current ratings. As we've previously communicated, we expect to fund the cash portion of the purchase with approximately $7 billion of new debt with $2 billion borrowed at close and $5 billion raised in 2024 across a range of maturities, subject to market conditions. Following the transaction related debt issuance in 2024, we expect to incur approximately $12.5 million of negative interest carry expense per quarter until deal close.As we previously communicated, the financing and capital management plan contemplated in this transaction is consistent with maintaining our current investment grade credit profile. We expect our credit ratios to be elevated over the 12 to 18 months post close. And we expect to bring our leverage ratios back in line with levels consistent with our credit profile, driven by substantial free cash flow generation and incremental debt capacity from EBITDA growth noting our track-record of effectively managing leverage within current ratings. In summary, in 2023, we delivered strong operational performance contributing to continued progress against our Aon United strategy. Our strong financial results and disciplined capital management enables us to return to $3.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.The steps we've taken around our three-by-three plan are accelerating our Aon United strategy catalyzed by Aon Business Services and reinforced by the restructuring program and our expected acquisition of NFP. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity to continue to drive top and bottom-line results to drive value for clients, colleagues and shareholders and look forward to building on this momentum in 2024 . With that, I'll turn the call-back over to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions.See also 35 Low-Stress High-Paying Jobs In The World and 15 Countries that Produce the Best Software Engineers.To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.Related Quotes`['AON']`

Our Risk Capital and Human Capital structure has unlocked new opportunities to grow, and Aon Business Services is a catalyst for innovation delivering new products and tools at scale across client segments and geographies.""FOURTH QUARTER 2023 FINANCIAL SUMMARYTotal revenue in the fourth quarter increased 8% to $3.4 billion compared to the prior year period reflecting 7% organic revenue growth, a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, and a 1% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other.Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased 23% to $2.6 billion compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in expense associated with 7% organic revenue growth, investments in long-term growth, a $197 million charge in connection with certain accrued actual or anticipated legal settlement expenses, and a $40 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Foreign currency translation in the fourth quarter had a $6 million, or $0.03 per share, favorable impact on U.S. GAAP net income and a $7 million, or $0.03 per share, favorable impact on adjusted net income. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, the Company would expect a favorable impact of approximately $0.03 per share, or an approximately $9 million increase in adjusted operating income, in the first quarter of 2024, and a favorable impact of approximately $0.02 per share, or an approximately $6 million increase in adjusted operating income, for full year 2024.Effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 16.7%, compared to  6.1% in the prior year period, primarily driven by changes in the geographical distribution of income and a lower net favorable impact from discrete items than in the prior year period. After adjusting to exclude the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, the adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 18.2% compared to 9.0% in the prior year period. The primary drivers of the change in the adjusted tax rate were the geographical distribution of income and a lower net favorable impact from discrete items than in the prior year period. These adjustments are discussed in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 202.0 million in the fourth quarter compared to 209.3 million in the prior year period. The Company repurchased 2.3 million class A ordinary shares for approximately $0.8 billion in the fourth quarter. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $3.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.FULL YEAR 2023 CASH FLOW SUMMARYThe full year 2023 cash flow summary provided below includes supplemental information related to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure that is described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue Growth and Free Cash Flow"" on page 9 of this press release.Cash flows provided by operations for 2023 increased $216 million, or 7%, to $3,435 million compared to the prior year period, reflecting strong operating income growth and overall working capital optimization, partially offset by a negative impact to working capital due to temporary invoicing delays associated with the implementation of a new system, and higher cash tax payments.Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, increased 5%, to $3,183 million in 2023 compared to the prior year, reflecting an increase in cash flows from operations, partially offset by a $56 million increase in capital expenditures, due primarily to ongoing investments in Aon Business Services-enabled technology platforms and technology to drive long-term-growth.FOURTH QUARTER 2023 REVENUE REVIEWThe fourth quarter revenue reviews provided below include supplemental information related to organic revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure that is described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue Growth and Free Cash Flow"" on page 9 of this press release.Three Months Ended December 31,(millions)20232022% ChangeLess:CurrencyImpactLess:FiduciaryInvestmentIncomeLess: Acquisitions, Divestitures & OtherOrganicRevenueGrowthRevenueCommercial Risk Solutions$     1,906$      1,8225 %1 %1 %(1) %4 %Reinsurance Solutions3322811816(3)14Health Solutions763678131—111Wealth Solutions37735373—(1)5Elimination(3)(4)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$     3,375$      3,1308 %2 %1 %(2) %7 %Total revenue increased $245 million, or 8%, to $3,375 million, compared to the prior year period, including organic revenue growth of 7% driven by ongoing strong retention, net new business generation, and management of the renewal book, a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, and a 1% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other.Commercial Risk Solutions organic revenue growth of 4% reflects solid growth across most major geographies driven by strong retention, management of the renewal book, and net new business generation. Growth in retail brokerage was highlighted by double-digit growth in Asia and the Pacific, driven by continued strength in core P&C. The U.S. grew modestly driven by strength in property, casualty, and construction, partially offset by the impact of external M&A and IPO markets. On average globally, exposures and pricing were positive, resulting in modestly positive market impact.Reinsurance Solutions organic revenue growth of 14% reflects strong growth in treaty, driven by strong retention and continued net new business generation, as well as strong growth in facultative placements and investment banking. Market impact was modestly positive on results in the quarter. The majority of revenue in our treaty portfolio is recurring in nature and is recorded in connection with the major renewal periods that take place throughout the first half of the year, while the second half of the year is typically driven by facultative placements, capital markets activity, and advisory work that is more transactional in nature.Health Solutions organic revenue growth of 11% reflects strong growth globally in core health and benefits brokerage primarily from net new business generation and management of the renewal book. Strength in the core was highlighted by double-digit growth in most major geographies. Results also reflect double-digit growth in Consumer Benefit Solutions and modest growth in Talent.Wealth Solutions organic revenue growth of 5% reflects strong growth in Retirement, driven by advisory demand and project-related work related to pension de-risking and ongoing impact of regulatory changes. In Investments, a modest increase in AUM-based delegated investment revenue was offset by a decline in advisory.FOURTH QUARTER 2023 EXPENSE REVIEWThree Months Ended December 31,(millions)20232022$ Change% ChangeExpensesCompensation and benefits$         1,671$         1,539$       1329 %Information technology131138(7)(5)Premises777345Depreciation of fixed assets48361233Amortization and impairment of intangible assets1926(7)(27)Other general expense52130621570Accelerating Aon United Program expenses129—129100Total operating expenses$         2,596$         2,118$       47823 %Compensation and benefits expense increased $132 million, or 9%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in expense associated with 7% organic revenue growth and a $32 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Information technology expense decreased $7 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to lower cloud costs and elevated technology investments in the prior year period.Premises expense increased $4 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year period.Depreciation of fixed assets increased $12 million, or 33%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to ongoing investments in Aon Business Services-enabled technology platforms to drive long-term growth.Amortization and impairment of intangible assets decreased $7 million, or 27%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a decrease associated with assets held for sale as part of ongoing portfolio management and assets fully amortized in the prior year period.Other general expense increased $215 million, or 70%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to a $197 million charge in connection with certain accrued actual or anticipated legal settlement expenses and $17 million of transaction costs associated with the expected acquisition of NFP.Accelerating Aon United Restructuring Program expenses were $129 million, relating to workforce optimization, asset impairments, and technology and other costs.FOURTH QUARTER 2023 INCOME SUMMARYCertain noteworthy items impacted adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margins in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, which are also described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.Three Months Ended December 31,(millions)20232022%  ChangeRevenue$     3,375$    3,1308 %Expenses2,5962,11823 %Operating income$         779$    1,012(23) %Operating margin23.1 %32.3 %Operating income - as adjusted$     1,141$    1,03810 %Operating margin - as adjusted33.8 %33.2 %Operating income decreased $233 million, or 23%, and operating margin decreased 920 basis points to 23.1%, each compared to the prior year period. Operating income, adjusted for certain items detailed on page 10 of this press release, increased $103 million, or 10%, and operating margin, adjusted for certain items, increased 60 basis points to 33.8%, each compared to the prior year period. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin reflects organic revenue growth and increased fiduciary investment income, partially offset by increased expenses and investments in long-term growth.Interest income increased $9 million compared to the prior year period, reflecting higher interest rates. Interest expense increased $14 million to $124 million compared to the prior year period, reflecting an overall increase in total debt and higher interest rates.Other income (expense) decreased $138 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a $170 million non-cash pension settlement charge in the prior year period that did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2023. Other income (expense) - as adjusted increased $32 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in non-cash net periodic pension cost.Net income attributable to Aon shareholders in the fourth quarter decreased 24% to $498 million compared to $657 million, in the prior year period. Net income attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted for certain items, in the fourth quarter decreased 4% to $785 million compared to $815 million, in the prior year period.2023 FULL YEAR SUMMARYTotal revenue in 2023 increased 7% to $13.4 billion compared to the prior year reflecting 7% organic revenue growth and a 2% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other.Net income attributable to Aon shareholders decreased to $2,564 million, or $12.51 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $2,589 million, or $12.14 per share, in the prior year. Net income per share, adjusted for certain items, increased 6% to $14.14 on a diluted basis, including an unfavorable impact of $0.17 per share from foreign currency translation, compared to $13.39 in the prior year. Certain items that impacted full year results and comparisons against the prior year are detailed in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.During 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 8.4 million class A ordinary shares for approximately $2.7 billion at an average price of $321.52 per share.

fluctuations in currency exchange, interest, or inflation rates that could impact our financial condition or results; changes in global equity and fixed income markets that could affect the return on invested assets; changes in the funded status of Aon's various defined benefit pension plans and the impact of any increased pension funding resulting from those changes; the level of Aon's debt and the terms thereof reducing Aon's flexibility or increasing borrowing costs; rating agency actions that could limit Aon's access to capital and our competitive position; volatility in Aon's global tax rate due to being subject to a variety of different factors, including the adoption and implementation of OECD tax proposals; changes in Aon's accounting estimates or assumptions on Aon's financial statements; limits on Aon's subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to Aon; the impact of legal proceedings and other contingencies, including those arising from acquisition or disposition transactions, errors and omissions and other claims against Aon (including proceeding and contingencies relating to transactions for which capital was arranged by Vesttoo Ltd.); the impact of, and potential challenges in complying with, laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Aon operates, particularly given the global nature of Aon's operations and the possibility of differing or conflicting laws and regulations, or the application or interpretation thereof, across jurisdictions in which Aon does business; the impact of any regulatory investigations brought in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S. and other countries; failure to protect intellectual property rights or allegations that Aon infringes on the intellectual property rights of others; general economic and political conditions in different countries in which Aon does business around the world; the failure to retain, attract and develop experienced and qualified personnel, whether as a result of the pending acquisition of NFP or otherwise; international risks associated with Aon's global operations, including impacts from military conflicts or political instability, such as the ongoing Russian war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict; the effects of natural or man-made disasters, including the effects of the COVID-19 and other health pandemics and the impacts of climate change; any system or network disruption or breach resulting in operational interruption or improper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data, and resulting liabilities or damage to our reputation; Aon's ability to develop, implement, update and enhance new systems; the actions taken by third parties that perform aspects of Aon's business operations and client services; the extent to which Aon is exposed to certain risks, including lawsuits, related to actions Aon may take in being responsible for making decisions on behalf of clients in Aon's investment businesses or in other advisory services that Aon currently provides, or may provide in the future; Aon's ability to continue, and the costs and risks associated with, growing, developing and integrating acquired business, and entering into new lines of business or products; Aon's ability to secure regulatory approval and complete transactions, including the pending acquisition of NFP, and the costs and risks associated with the failure to consummate proposed transactions; changes in commercial property and casualty markets, commercial premium rates or methods of compensation; Aon's ability to develop and implement innovative growth strategies and initiatives intended to yield cost savings (including the Accelerating Aon United Program), and the ability to achieve such growth or cost savings; the effects of Irish law on Aon's operating flexibility and the enforcement of judgments against Aon; adverse effects on the market price of Aon's securities and/or operating results for any reason, including, without limitation, because of a failure to consummate the pending acquisition of NFP or the failure to realize the expected benefits of the pending acquisition of NFP (including anticipated revenue and growth synergies) in the expected timeframe, or at all; significant transaction and integration costs or difficulties in connection with the pending acquisition of NFP or unknown or inestimable liabilities; and potential impact of the consummation of the pending acquisition of NFP on relationships, including with suppliers, customers, employees and regulators.Any or all of Aon's forward-looking statements may turn out to be inaccurate, and there are no guarantees about Aon's performance. The factors identified above are not exhaustive. Aon and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. In addition, results for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any future period. Further information concerning Aon and its businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect Aon's financial results, is contained in Aon's filings with the SEC. See Aon's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to Aon and its businesses. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Aon is not under, and expressly disclaims, any obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Explanation of Non-GAAP MeasuresThis communication includes supplemental information not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""), including organic revenue growth, free cash flow, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted net income attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted diluted net income per share, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted other income (expense) – pensions, adjusted other income (expense), and adjusted income before income taxes that exclude the effects of intangible asset amortization and impairment, pension settlements, Accelerating Aon United Program expenses, NFP transaction costs, certain legal settlements, capital expenditures, and certain other noteworthy items that affected results for the comparable periods. Organic revenue growth includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures (including held for sale businesses), transfers between revenue lines, fiduciary investment income, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. Currency impact represents the effect on prior year period results if they were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Reconciliations to the closest U.S. GAAP measure for each non-GAAP measure presented in this communication are provided in the attached appendices. Supplemental organic revenue growth information and additional measures that exclude the effects of certain items noted above do not affect net income or any other U.S. GAAP reported amounts. Free cash flow is cash flows from operating activity less capital expenditures. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the applicable tax impact associated with expenses for estimated intangible asset amortization and impairment, and certain other noteworthy items. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Management also uses these measures to assess operating performance and performance for compensation. Non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, Aon's Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.Investor Contact:Media Contact:Leslie FollmerWill Dunn+1 312-381-3310+1 312-381-3024investor.relations@aon.commediainquiries@aon.com  Aon plcConsolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)Three Months Ended December 31,Twelve Months Ended December 31,(millions, except per share data)20232022%Change20232022%ChangeRevenueTotal revenue$  3,375$  3,1308 %$  13,376$  12,4797 %ExpensesCompensation and benefits1,6711,5399 %6,9026,4777 %Information technology131138(5) %5345095 %Premises77735 %2942892 %Depreciation of fixed assets483633 %16715111 %Amortization and impairment of intangible assets1926(27) %89113(21) %Other general expense52130670 %1,4701,27116 %Accelerating Aon United Program expenses129—100 %135—100 %Total operating expenses2,5962,11823 %9,5918,8109 %Operating income7791,012(23) %3,7853,6693 %Interest income123300 %311872 %Interest expense(124)(110)13 %(484)(406)19 %Other income (expense)(58)(196)(70) %(163)(125)30 %Income before income taxes609709(14) %3,1693,156— %Income tax expense (1)10243137 %5415106 %Net income507666(24) %2,6282,646(1) %Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests99— %645712 %Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$      498$      657(24) %$  2,564$  2,589(1) %Basic net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$     2.49$     3.17(21) %$  12.60$  12.233 %Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$     2.47$     3.14(21) %$  12.51$  12.143 %Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding - basic200.3207.5(3) %203.5211.7(4) %Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding - diluted202.0209.3(3) %205.0213.2(4) %(1)The effective tax rate was 16.7% and 6.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 17.1% and 16.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Aon plcReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue Growth and Free Cash Flow (Unaudited)Organic Revenue Growth (Unaudited)Three Months Ended December 31,(millions)20232022% ChangeLess: CurrencyImpact (1)Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & OtherOrganic Revenue Growth (3)RevenueCommercial Risk Solutions$          1,906$          1,8225 %1 %1 %(1) %4 %Reinsurance Solutions3322811816(3)14Health Solutions763678131—111Wealth Solutions37735373—(1)5Elimination(3)(4)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$          3,375$          3,1308 %2 %1 %(2) %7 % Twelve Months Ended December 31,(millions)20232022% ChangeLess: CurrencyImpact (1)Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & OtherOrganic Revenue Growth (3)RevenueCommercial Risk Solutions$          7,043$          6,7155 %— %2 %(2) %5 %Reinsurance Solutions2,4812,19013(1)4—10Health Solutions2,4332,2249——(1)10Wealth Solutions1,4311,3675——14Elimination(12)(17)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$        13,376$        12,4797 %— %2 %(2) %7 %(1)Currency impact represents the effect on prior year period results if they were translated at current period foreign exchange rates.(2)Fiduciary investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $78 million and $41 million, respectively.

AJG, Willis Towers Watson plc WTW and Brown and Brown BRO.The increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help the industry to function smoothly.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests, against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity. Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed healthcare services. Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to rise to $628.3 billion by 2032 or at a nine-year (2023-2032) CAGR of 9.3%. Research Dive estimates the industry players to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028 at a seven-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: The operational results of the industry players are affected by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Thus, the growth of insurance brokers depends on the demand for insurance products, which, in turn, is driven by increased awareness.  Keeping this in mind, industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, improving pricing, tightening underwriting standards and designing products that are more appealing to customers and match their risk appetite. Better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials, as well as increasing awareness, is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance as well as other forms of insurance. Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and slow organic growth. Increased Adoption of Technology: Industry players are focused on leveraging technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies and alter business models. Accelerated digitalization has helped to curb costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization also accelerates claims processing, drives sales and improves retention rate. However, the expenses associated with such investments increase costs and, in turn, the expense ratio. Moreover, cyber threats lurk.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

Earnings Miss: Here's What Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) Analysts Are Forecasting For This Year`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-miss-heres-air-products-111847899.html`2024-02-07 11:18:47`It's shaping up to be a tough period for Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD), which a week ago released some disappointing first-quarter results that could have a notable impact on how the market views the stock. Air Products and Chemicals missed analyst forecasts, with revenues of US$3.0b and statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.73, falling short by 6.6% and 7.6% respectively. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Air Products and Chemicals after the latest results. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals After the latest results, the 21 analysts covering Air Products and Chemicals are now predicting revenues of US$12.9b in 2024. If met, this would reflect a reasonable 3.7% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to expand 20% to US$12.55. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$13.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$13.01 in 2024. The analysts are less bullish than they were before these results, given the reduced revenue forecasts and the small dip in earnings per share expectations.The consensus price target fell 7.5% to US$286, with the weaker earnings outlook clearly leading valuation estimates. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Air Products and Chemicals analyst has a price target of US$355 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$240. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Air Products and Chemicals shareholders.These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Air Products and Chemicals' past performance and to peers in the same industry. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Air Products and Chemicals' revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 4.9% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 9.7% over the past five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 3.3% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while Air Products and Chemicals' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, but the latest forecasts still imply the business will grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target fell measurably, with the analysts seemingly not reassured by the latest results, leading to a lower estimate of Air Products and Chemicals' future valuation.With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Air Products and Chemicals going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here..We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Air Products and Chemicals that you need to be mindful of.Have feedback on this article?

Air Products Sees $15B Hydrogen, Energy Transition Project Backlog`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-products-sees-15b-hydrogen-085818876.html`2024-02-07 08:58:18`Industrial gases company Air Products continues to strengthen its hydrogen position with a hydrogen and energy transition backlog of about $15 billion.The Pennsylvania-headquartered company has eight hydrogen projects underway, targeting an IRR of more than 10%. The projects include three blue hydrogen projects—two in Louisiana and one in the Netherlands—as well as a green hydrogen project in New York.“Air Products is pursuing a first mover growth strategy with our core industrial gases business as the first pillar and our blue and green hydrogen projects as the second pillar,” Air Products CEO Seifi Ghasemi said during the company’s Feb. 5 earnings webcast. “Executing our strategy in these two pillars, with sustainability underpinning both of them, enables us to fulfill our higher purpose as a company, which is to help solve significant energy and environmental challenges in our world.”Used mostly today for oil refining and production of ammonia, a key ingredient for fertilizers, hydrogen is seen as a promising route to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. While global focus on reducing emissions has put the spotlight on hydrogen in recent years, luring new players to the field, Air Products has been in the hydrogen business for more than 60 years.“By producing and delivering low- and zero-carbon hydrogen at the scale for heavy duty transportation and industry, we can meaningfully contribute to the goal of decarbonizing the world,” Ghasemi said. “We believe that the first mover advantage will be substantial and deliver enduring long-term shareholder value, both in terms of return to Air Products and in generating a cleaner future for everybody.”Most of the company’s planned $5 billion to $5.5 billion in planned capex for the year will go toward the NEOM green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia.Working with joint venture partners ACWA Power and NEOM Green Hydrogen Co., the $8.4 billion project will be one of the world’s largest green hydrogen projects. When complete, the plant will produce up to 600 tonnes per day of hydrogen in the form of green ammonia by year-end 2026. Developers say they will use up to 4 gigawatts of solar and wind energy as part of the process.Substantial amounts will also be used for Air Products’ sustainable aviation fuel facility in Los Angeles and its blue hydrogen facility in Canada, Ghasemi said. Located in Edmonton, Alberta, the $1.6 billion hydrogen facility will use advanced auto-thermal reforming technology. The project is currently in the construction phase, Air Products COO Samir Serhan said.“We look to bring it on stream in [second-half] fiscal year ’25 in line with our customer plans,” Serhan said.He said the company had no updates regarding the project’s deployed capital or government incentives.In North Texas, Air Projects is working with The AES Corp. to develop an approximately $4 billion green hydrogen production facility in Wilbarger County, Texas. Air Products is in the process of getting a permit and doing preliminary engineering, Ghasemi said.Also on deck for Air Products: a $4.5 billion Louisiana Clean Energy Complex, where more than 750 MMscf/d of blue hydrogen will be produced and CO2 captured and permanently sequestered underground. Startup is expected in fiscal year 2027, if all required permits and approvals are secured.Ghasemi said the EPA’s authorization to give the state of Louisiana approval over CO2 sequestration in the state could cut about a year off the timeline of getting a Class VI permit.Although Air Products reported 3% higher volumes driven by strong hydrogen demand and 2% higher pricing for first-quarter 2024, sales in the Americas of $1.3 billion were down by 10% compared to a year earlier, due to a 15% lower energy cost pass-through.Related Quotes`['APD']`

I'm very pleased to share that our employee recorded injury rate in first quarter was 78% than in 2014. And our employee lost time injury rate was at a record roll the best in the industry. Our ultimate goal will always be zero accidents and zero incidents.Now please turn to Slide #4, which summarizes our management philosophy. These principles remain fundamental to how we manage and grow our company.Now please turn to Slide #5. I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the results for this quarter. Our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.82 was 7% higher than last year. Our business performed well and we are moving forward. There were several positive contributions to this result that included: strong conversion margins, robust on-site activities in Americas and Europe and higher quality affiliate income globally.Despite the year-to-year improvement that I just mentioned, our results diverged from the guidance we have given you due to several items that were not factored in our first quarter 2024 outlook. We have given you a forecast and we are delivering less than the forecast. But again, I'd like to stress that we are 7% higher than last year.These factors that affected our guidance are, number 1, larger-than-anticipated volume headwinds from weak economic growth in China. We were too optimistic about the performance in China. Second one is lower helium demand in electronics, especially across the world. But I would like to mention that our pricing in helium stays very stable and very robust. But we have -- the volume was lower than we expected. There is a high -- we had experienced higher costs for a sale of equipment project and the impact of Argentine's currency devaluation.With this, let me talk about our revised full year guidance range. Please turn to Slide #6. We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $12.20 to $12.50, which reflects the first quarter events I just discussed. It also reflects evolving geopolitical developments and uncertainties and continued weakness in Asia and helium volumes.This new range is supported by expected positive volume contributions from several new on-site plants and improvement in our LNG sale of equipment business as well as continuing cost productivity that we always pursue. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $2.60 to $2.75. We continue to expect our CapEx to be between $5 billion and $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2024.Now please turn to Slide #7. We are proud of our adjusted earnings per share improvement since 2014, and we have delivered on a consecutive basis for the last 10 years more than 10% annual growth in our earnings. I would like to take the time to thank each and every one of our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication and commitment, which has made it possible for us to deliver these excellent results.Now please turn to Slide #8. In addition to investing in high-return projects, we believe creating shareholder value includes returning cash to our investors by paying a healthy dividend directly to them. In January, we again raised our quarterly dividend to $1.77 per share per quarter, extending our record of 42 consecutive years of dividend increase.We expect to return approximately $1.6 billion to our shareholders in 2024 while continuing to execute hard return industrial gas and clean hydrogen projects that support our customers in their sustainability journey and drive the energy transition. This balanced approach to capital allocation will allow us to meet our capital needs while maintaining our A/A2 credit rating.Now please turn to Slide #9, which shows our EBITDA margin trend since 2014. Our margins have returned to roughly 40% since the second half of fiscal year 2023, going a 1,500 basis point improvement versus 2014. And our margins are leading industry margins and they reflect the continued strength of our business model.Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer, to give you a summary of our first quarter 2024 results. Melissa?Melissa N. SchaefferThank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our first quarter results. As Seifi stated, our business fundamentals are strong. In comparison to last year, we continue to show underlying sales growth with both positive volume and price. Overall, price for the quarter was up despite lower energy costs across most regions. Volume improved 3% driven by strong on-site volume, including higher demand for hydrogen and contributions from new assets, but partially offset by weaker demand for helium, particularly in Asia.Declining natural gas prices in Europe and North America resulted in 11% lower energy cost pass-through for the company overall. This had no impact on profit but contributed to higher margins. EBITDA improved 8% as favorable volume price net of power costs and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs driven by higher planned maintenance activities and inflation.EBITDA margin of 39.2% jumped more than 500 basis points with lower energy cost pass-through contributing to about 3/4 of this improvement. ROCE remained steady at about 12%. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been about 13%. Sequentially, results were unfavorable primarily due to seasonality in the Americas and sale of equipment headwinds in our corporate segment.Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our first quarter adjusted earnings was $2.82 per share, up $0.18 or 7% compared to last year due to favorable volume, pricing and higher equity affiliate income, partially offset by unfavorable costs.Volume was $0.11 due to improvements in Americas and Europe, which more than offset shortfalls in Asia and the corporate segment. Price, net of variable costs contributed $0.15 this quarter driven by both pricing actions and lower power costs. Costs at an unfavorable impact of $0.21, driven by higher planned maintenance costs, inflation and our efforts support our growth strategy.Equity affiliate income was $0.18 higher due to the contribution of the second phase of Jazan project and positive results from our unconsolidated joint ventures across most regions. The remaining items, including lower tax rate, higher interest expense and other nonoperating expense together had a modest negative 5% impact.Before I turn the call to Dr. Serhan, I would also like to thank the people of Air Products for their commitment to the company. I am proud to be working alongside them as we continue to execute our strategy. Now to begin to review our business segment results, I'll turn the call to Dr. Serhan.Samir Jawdat SerhanThank you, Melissa. Please turn to Slide 12 for a review of our Americas segment results. Compared to last year, price and volume together were up 5%. Adverse merchant price increase of 6%, this represents a 2% price improvement for the region overall. This drove contribution margin improvement. Volume grew 3% due to strong demand for hydrogen. EBITDA was up 9%, driven by strong price as well as favorable volume and equity affiliates income, while partially offset by higher planned maintenance costs.EBITDA margin was up by almost 800 basis points, driven mostly by lower energy cost cash flow. Sequentially, EBITDA decreased 7% mainly due to seasonality as demand moderated and maintenance activities picked up during the winter.Now please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Asia segment results. The challenging economic conditions in China and the weak electronics market continued to put pressure on the region. Third to last year, our volumes were flat for the region as higher on-site activity offset lower helium demand. Price did jump 1% as we continued to focus on price over volume.EBITDA and EBITDA margin were down primarily due to the unfavorable helium volumes and higher costs. Sequentially, results improved relative to the unfavorable business mix in the previous quarter.Please turn to Slide 14 for a review of our Europe segment results. Volumes were up 9%, benefiting from better on-site activities, including the new project in Uzbekistan. Compared to last year, merchant pricing remained stable relative to the decline in energy costs, contributing to margin improvement.EBITDA was up 28% driven by favorable volume, lower power costs and stronger currencies against the U.S. dollar, which more than compensated for increased costs due to inflation and planned maintenance activities. EBITDA margin was over 1,000 basis points higher, about half of which was due to the impact of lower energy cost pass-through. Sequentially, results improved driven by favorable price, volume and cost.Now please turn to Slide 15 for a review of our Middle East and India segment results. Compared to last year, sales decreased due to lower volume, EBITDA improved due to the completion of the second phase of the Jazan project in mid-January of last year.Please now turn to Slide 16 for our corporate and other segment results. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. Despite higher sales from LNG activity, EBITDA declined due to higher costs in our non-LNG sale of equipment business, as Seifi mentioned before.Our activities related to the LNG equipment and technology business are robust. We continue to have constructive conversations with customers who are interested in our offerings, and we expect our LNG-related projects to improve the corporate segment moving forward.At this moment, I also would like to thank our teams around the world for their effort and demonstrating their determination to overcome the challenges we are facing. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing remarks. Seifi?Seifollah GhasemiThank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide #17. As I always say, our real competitive advantage is the commitment, dedication and motivation of our people. I am proud to see that commitment and motivation in action every day in our company, and I'm very proud of our people. The fundamentals of our existing business are strong and we are moving forward. The short-term issues we have discussed do not change the compelling long-term prospects of Air Products.Air Products is pursuing a first-mover growth strategy with our core industrial gases business as the first pillar and our blue and green hydrogen projects as the second pillar. Executing our strategy in these 2 pillars with sustainability underpinning both of them enables us to fulfill our higher purpose as a company, which is to help solve significant energy and environmental challenges in our world. That is our highest purpose.First, our industrial gases business and technology solutions help customers across dozens of industries improve yield, increase production, reduce energy consumption and lower emissions, in other words, to make more with less, while reducing the impact on the environment.Second, the world needs more energy and wants that energy delivered with a lower carbon footprint. At Air Products, we are demonstrating our leadership position, leveraging our decade-long experience, core competencies, core technologies and our ability to execute world-scale hydrogen projects.By producing and delivering low and zero carbon hydrogen at the scale for heavy UG transportation and industry, we can meaningfully contribute to the goal of decarbonizing the world. We believe that the first mover advantage will be substantial and deliver enduring long-term shareholder value, both in terms of return to Air Products and in generating a cleaner future for everybody.With that, we are now more than happy to take your questions.Operator(Operator Instructions) And we'll go first to Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.Jeffrey John ZekauskasWhen did the Gulf Coast ammonia projects come on? And is that a meaningful income stream for you?Seifollah GhasemiGulf Coast ammonia consists of 2 different parts, one is the hydrogen plant and the other one is the actual ammonia plant. I can comment on the hydrogen plant because we own that and that is sale of gas that is on stream and it's producing revenue. And on the other part, I don't want to comment because we don't own that facility and allow the owners to make a statement on that, if it's necessary.Jeffrey John ZekauskasIn the quarter, there was -- yes, thank you for that. In the quarter, the expense is materially higher year-over-year that your expectations for 2024, you have a large cost-cutting program, maybe losses on sale of equipment would be smaller, there was significant room for improvement, particular line. Is that the case or have things changed?Seifollah GhasemiJeff, you are absolutely right. That is the case. In the first quarter, our costs were higher because of the sale of equipment issue that you mentioned. And we expect that in the -- as we go forward, that would not be repeated, and therefore, our year-to-year cost will be lower, as I had mentioned to you before.OperatorWe'll go next to Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners.Michael Joseph HarrisonI was hoping that you could give a little bit more detail on what's going on within the helium business. Is that a situation where demand is lower or a situation where you guys are struggling to get the volumes of helium that you need? And also which regions have the biggest exposure to helium? It seems like this is mostly an Asia issue, at least in the first quarter.Seifollah GhasemiThank you for the question and that's an excellent question. Number 1, we do not have any issues with having helium molecules for sale. We are actually the best -- we have always been the supplier that has delivered helium to people when they need it. We have a tavern, we have significant production facilities around the world. So we are a very reliable supplier and we have always been.The issue with helium is that, number 1, demand is lower especially in electronics across the board and particularly in China and in Asia. And the other thing is that, as I said, we operate on the basis that we want value for the product that we are selling. So we have held on the pricing and whether we might have lost some market share, that is possible.But we have no issues delivering the product but we definitely see, as I said, a weakness in demand across the world. And in terms of Air Products, in terms of helium volumes, obviously, Asia is a significant part of that. It's not -- the other regions use a lot of helium, too, but Asia is the biggest one.Michael Joseph HarrisonAll right. That's very helpful. And then my second question is related to your guidance. It looks like the implied guidance for the first half of the year is around $5.50 in EPS and you're expecting maybe something closer to $7 in the second half. Can you talk about the visibility that you have that gives you confidence on a much better second half? And maybe help us bridge the improvement that you're expecting in the second half versus the first half, that $1.50 or so.Seifollah GhasemiWell, that's an excellent question. Obviously, the guidance is what is our best estimate at this point, right? We can't foresee the world events. But fundamentally, when you look at Air Products, during the years we consistently delivered about 46%, 47% of the year results in the first half and we delivered around 53%, 54% in the second half. So the second half is usually our strongest quarter because of seasonality. So you should take that into account.And then the other thing that we are right now, by giving you the guidance, is that we are expecting that in the second half of the year, some of the on-site projects that we have will be running very strongly, and therefore, we will have a higher income from those. That is our estimate as of today. But how the world will turn, we'll see. But that is how we bridge the gap of why we will be able to deliver the $7 versus the $5.50 in the first half.OperatorWe'll go next to John Roberts from Mizuho.John RobertsSeifi, is the weakness in China also related to on-site operations? And maybe you could separate the gasifier business from other on-site.Seifollah GhasemiJohn, first of all, thank you for your question, and I hope all is well with you. There is no weakness in on-site in China. Our on-site business is take or pay across the world, therefore we don't see any issues there. The fundamental issue is on the merchant side and helium and that is related to the economic activity.I'd just like to caution everybody on the call that the economic situation in China is not as robust as people might think. As you know, we make products that are used instantaneously. We are a great leading indicator. And things are not really that exciting in that part of the world.OperatorWe'll go next to Steve Byrne from Bank of America.Stephen V. ByrneI was just looking at the location of Jazan, and it seems to be within 100 miles of quite a few of these recent strikes in Yemen. And I just wanted to ask, is everything there okay at the plant? Or do you see any access to labor or risks of this issue going on right now?Seifollah GhasemiWell, first of all, up to now, we have not seen any incidents. None of these missiles and so on have been directed at the facility. So I mean, I can't predict the future. But up to now, there has not been any issues. The refinery is running fully. Our investment -- I mean, our performance there is great. I'm very proud of our people.We are operating 16 gasifiers, which are the largest in the world for gasifying the bottom of the refinery. And despite predictions for the worse, those things are actually working and we are producing syngas, we are supplying hydrogen to the refinery and we are making close to 4,000 megawatts of power that is delivered to the Saudi grid. So up to now, everything is fine.Stephen V. ByrneVery good. And can you provide any more detail on the CapEx target for the year, the $5 billion to $5.5 billion. Can you just highlight what are the largest projects within that list? I was just curious whether you're moving forward with the project in North Texas this year.Seifollah GhasemiRight now, in that $5 billion and $5.5 billion, there is not a significant amount of money for the project in Texas because we are in the process of getting the permit and doing the preliminary engineering. But we did spend a few hundred million, but it is not a significant part of the $5.5 billion.The $5 billion to $5.5 billion is mainly going to be spent on our continuing operations in NEOM in Saudi Arabia for our green hydrogen facility, a substantial amount of it will go to our blue hydrogen facility and other substantial amount will be our blue hydrogen facility in Canada and then obviously, our expenditure on the sustainable airline fuel facility in Los Angeles.And then obviously, we have our maintenance CapEx and about $1 billion a year that we spend on our day-to-day investments, like any other industrial gas business that they don't usually talk about it and we don't put out press releases about how many small projects won because we do win small projects like everybody else. But that is about $1 billion, too. And our maintenance CapEx is around $500 million, $600 million. So $1.5 billion is those and then the rest of it is for the big projects.OperatorWe'll go next to John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets.John Patrick McNultySo we had a question on the dividend hike that you guys announced earlier. It strikes us as kind of smaller than, I guess, what we've seen in the past from Air Products. And I guess the question is, why is that? And is it -- is there any concern from, say, the rating agencies around the comfort with your capital spending? Or is there some change why that hike would be as kind of modest as it's been? I guess how should we think about that?Seifollah GhasemiWell, for the past 6 or 7 years, I have always been telling people that I personally believe that dividend should be a percentage of the stock price. And we had given people a guidance that we target, that we pay about 2.5% of our stock price as dividend and we were doing that. But now with the stock price, where it is, and you are talking about now more than $7, it's significantly higher than that. So I don't see why we should significantly increase the dividend when the stock price is where it is.Because the shareholders are getting more than 2.5% from the stock and then 10% growth, then it becomes at least almost a guaranteed 12.5% return if they buy the stock. There is no issue with respect to our cash or cash flow and so on, but -- we also have investors who believe we shouldn't pay any dividend but obviously, that will never happen and we are never going to reduce the dividend. But the rate of increase is very directly related to the stock price, my friend.John Patrick McNultyGot it. Okay. So it's more about the yield, not necessarily the earnings growth or anything like that.Seifollah GhasemiExactly.John Patrick McNultyOkay. And then just as a follow-up question, it would just be on -- I know you mentioned earlier in kind of first half versus second half, there's a bunch of projects that should be running a little harder, running up more or coming on. I guess, can you remind us what projects aren't necessarily fully running in your first half of the year but will be in the second half of the year, just so we can kind of model that out or map that out a little bit better?Seifollah GhasemiWell, that one then I'm going to get into disclosing the operational details of our customers, and I'm not -- I don't have the privilege of doing that because of the confidentiality agreements we have. So if you give me a break, I cannot answer that question in detail. Sorry about that.OperatorWe'll go next to Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.Vincent Stephen AndrewsIf I could just ask on the helium, what was sort of the surprise in the quarter on the electronic side of the equation? Like so what's really changing with those customers? Is it something in particular or is it just the economy there is decelerating? And are we at the point with it in the electronics piece that you're comfortable that, that aspect has flattened out at a level that you're comfortable with? Maybe we could start there.Seifollah GhasemiVincent, thanks for the good question. Usually, what happens with the electronics industry, and you know this better than I do, is that they run very strongly during the third quarter of the calendar year to make all of the chips and so on which are used for all the toys and everything that people are going to buy for Christmas. And then when that period is over, usually the fourth quarter of the year for the chip makers is slower. That is the general thing.And then in addition to that, you do have economic conditions and all of that. I am not an expert in terms of the dynamics of the electronics industry, but I would like to tell you that, that is what we are seeing, that a lot of these people are slowing down. And then the other thing that might be in play is that the helium prices being high, it significantly affects the operational people at the chip manufacturing facilities to try to conserve as much helium as they can or other users. So there might be a little bit of a demand disruption, too.Vincent Stephen AndrewsOkay. And then as a follow-up, in the fiscal second quarter we obviously just had another winter storm or winter freeze in the Gulf Coast area. Are you anticipating that you're going to have some downtime associated with that or customers are going to have downtime from some plants being turned off in preparation for that weather event?Seifollah GhasemiThat's a very difficult question to answer, quite honestly. That might be the case, but I don't want to predict that, Vincent. I don't know.Vincent Stephen AndrewsWell, I just meant what has already happened, the storm that happened in January. Is that already baked in?Seifollah GhasemiYes. Dr. Serhan, do you have anything to add to that?Samir Jawdat SerhanMinor issues really that happened. We still see very strong hydrogen demand even during that phase.OperatorWe'll go next to David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.David L. BegleiterJust staying on helium, Can you quantify the impact of the year-over-year helium profit decline in Q1 and your expectations for the full year in terms of helium profit decline?Seifollah GhasemiDavid, you're asking a question that we have never answered, that is, we have never really disclosed the details of the performance of our helium business for competitive reasons. And I'm sure you understand that. So I do not want to quantify that exactly. But if you look at the -- when you compare to last year, when we compare to last year, we are still ahead. What we are trying to explain is the difference between what we delivered versus guidance versus last year, we are still ahead.But we expected -- we did not expect the weakness in helium the way it has materialized. Would it continue in the second quarter and the third -- I mean, in the second, third and fourth quarter of our fiscal year? Remains to be seen. And that is one of the reasons we lowered our guidance because we are allowing for the fact that it might continue. But we don't know for sure.David L. BegleiterUnderstood. And just on the Alberta project now that it's within 12 months hopefully of start-up, do you have timing of that project ramping up early next year? And how should we think about the earnings contribution throughout the calendar year '25 for Alberta?Seifollah GhasemiDavid, you broke up. I didn't understand which project you were referring to.David L. BegleiterThe Alberta project. When will it come on stream? And how should we think about the earnings cadence post the start-up early next year?Seifollah GhasemiSure. Excellent. I'll have Dr. Serhan answer that. Dr. Serhan?Samir Jawdat SerhanThank you for the question. We remain incredibly excited about our first blue net zero hydrogen project that's in the construction phase right now. We look to bring it on stream in fiscal year '25, in line with our customary plans. There are no updates in regard to the deployed capital and also the government incentive, we provided that already. So again, we're really fully committed to this asset and things are going well and we're aligned with our customer, IOL.David L. BegleiterWill it be online for this fiscal year?Samir Jawdat SerhanIt's in fiscal year '25, I mean, in the second half. This is really in alignment with the planned renewable refinery.Seifollah GhasemiSo basically, everything is going well for that up to now.OperatorWe'll go next to Josh Spector from UBS.Joshua David SpectorSo I wanted to follow up just on the guidance and maybe ask specifically, when you talk about the challenges and uncertainty in China and helium demand, et cetera, I guess, to hit your second half, do markets need to improve? Or are you assuming any improvement there? Or is status quo plus what you see coming online enough to get to what your expectations are today for the second half?Seifollah GhasemiNo, we don't expect any improvement, we expect things to be the way they are. I just hope that things don't get worse because of the geopolitical developments. But we are not factoring any significant improvement in world economy. No, that's correct.Joshua David SpectorOkay. That's helpful. And just on the sale of equipment. So when you talk about the increase in cost there, is that cost to execute, is that a material issue, a specific contract? Just thinking about how unique or one-off that is. And when you talk about your LNG wins and you've been talking about more projects coming online or sales in the next couple of years, is that a risk we need to think about with some of those contracts underwater or some other cost issue?Seifollah GhasemiIf I may answer the second part, the LNG thing, we expect -- the projects that you're talking about are the projects which are already under execution and we have won. So the risk on that is low. With respect to the sale of equipment thing, what we are talking about is inflation and delays in execution and all of that, that is costing us money. Okay?OperatorWe'll go over to Marc Bianchi from TD Cowen.Marc Gregory BianchiThe question was asked earlier about the large components of CapEx, and you had mentioned NEOM, the 2 blue hydrogen projects and SAF. You provided an update on Alberta just now. I'm curious if you could update us on the status of the other 3.Seifollah GhasemiWell, on the other 3 we don't have anything substantial to report other than what we have told you before. So things are going okay with them as of right now. So we do not have anything material that has happened to report to you yet.Marc Gregory BianchiOkay. Could you just remind us the start-up expectation for NEOM, Louisiana and SAF?Seifollah GhasemiNEOM, we are expecting -- I mean, December 31, 2026. With Louisiana, what we have said up to now has been fiscal year 2028. And with SAF, it is somewhere around fiscal year 2027, depending on us getting all of the permits that we need. So -- I'm sorry, with date, I'd like to correct that to 2027. I said -- I think I said '28 but it's '27. That's approximately the time line for those projects.Marc Gregory BianchiOkay. The other question I had was there have been some reports and news stories lately about natural hydrogen, so naturally occurring hydrogen deposits that could be quite meaningful. I'm curious what your view of that is and if you have any involvement.Seifollah GhasemiWe do not have any involvement in that. And I don't want to give you a scientific answer, but that's a little bit of a pie in the sky that there's hydrogen sitting there that you need to (inaudible) and it will come out at zero cost. But we are not involved in any projects like that and we are not going to get involved in that because we just do not think that, that is a reality.OperatorWe'll go next to Mike Leithead from Barclays.Michael James LeitheadSeifi, could you maybe update us on the state of your ongoing discussions for green and blue ammonia potential offtake? Should we expect some offtake announcements later this year? Or do you still believe it's better to wait until closer to project startup to formalize some of those?Seifollah GhasemiWell, on that, you're rising an excellent point. We have basically told people that do not expect any announcement about any offtake until about a year or 1.5 years before the plants come onstream. And the main reason for that is that we believe that as we get closer to the deadlines, that companies have to comply with the new environmental rules, they would certainly realize that there are not that many rear commercial facilities coming onstream that has the product, therefore, the value of our product will be higher than what people think it is today.So we are not in a hurry to sign any agreements. We think the demand is there so we are going to take our time. But in the meantime, if somebody wants to act sooner and gives us a contract -- a long-term contract at the prices that we expect, we might announce that sooner. But I wouldn't want the investors to expect any announcements soon, okay?Michael James LeitheadThat makes sense. That's great. That makes sense. And then maybe on a similar note, I believe that the Treasury Department recently came out with guidance around the green hydrogen tax credit. I think most people viewed it as fairly strict, although I also believe Air Products' plans are pretty well aligned with this guidance. Bigger picture, do you have any concerns about the strict interpretation limiting the U.S. industry's ability to take off? Or do you actually see it as advantageous for Air Products?Seifollah GhasemiNo, we absolutely disagree with that point of view that this is limiting. I mean, how is it limiting? We are complying with every single part of what the Treasury Department has put out the 3 pillars and we are committing billions of dollars to build these facilities. Other people can do the same thing. Some people are trying to get money from the government by continuing to pollute the atmosphere and we don't believe that. We believe very strongly in the 3 pillars. That means that any electricity use for production of green hydrogen needs to be additional. Otherwise, you're just going to use coal to replace that power that you use. So it has to be additional.The second thing, it has to be hourly. Because otherwise in the middle of the night when there is no sun, if somebody makes green hydrogen, then you're drawing power from the grid and that has to be replaced again from coal-fired plants and all of that. And so additionality, hourly and then the other thing is that it has to be on the same network.We are fully supportive of what the Treasury Department has put out, I'd like to applaud them for sticking to their principles that the IRA was designed not to make companies rich, but IRA was designed to save the environment. And this should not allow people to get some subsidies if they are not doing something to reduce their pollution into the atmosphere.The IRA is not a handout. The IRA is designed, that is why Congress approved it, to improve the environment, And we should all abide by that. Therefore, we are fully in line with the those rules that Treasury put out, and I really hope that they keep their nerve and execute those principles because those are the right principles, and we are fully supportive of that.And again, I'd like to stress that we are spending billions of dollars. We are -- and executing projects right now even before those rules come out, complying with those rules because we think they are the right rules, okay?OperatorWe'll go next to Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs.Patrick Duffy FischerQuestion on cash flow, if I could. At least in the first quarter, cash flow was down or operating cash flow was down double digits even though earnings was up. Will that invert throughout the year? Would you expect operating cash flow to grow roughly at the same level of EPS this year?Seifollah GhasemiDuffy, I'm glad you asked this question, but I'll have Melissa go through the details. But my friend, our EBITDA is going up. If our EBITDA is going up, the cash coming to the company is going up. What we are reporting is accounting and it's the timing of the cash. We report the number because we book it, but then we get the actual cash it's different because of our equity affiliates. But I think the best person to qualify to answer this, because I don't want to get into accounting details, Melissa, would you please explain that?Melissa N. SchaefferYes, absolutely. Thank you, Seifi. So first of all, Duffy, so our EBITDA cash eversion is stable and our distributable and investment cash flow are both positive. So that's in line with our year-over-year EBITDA improvement. Additionally, we have industry-leading DSO, so all very strong. We did see an incremental reduction in our operating cash flow to EBITDA this quarter.There are a few items that attribute to this, namely it's really timing component related to our distributions of earnings for our large equity affiliate. Again, not an issue with profit, just timing. And the second one is we do manage and look to derisk our helium supply chain and then so we are building some of our helium inventory, which obviously has an offset to operating cash, but obviously, we'll attribute to process moving forward.Seifollah GhasemiOkay, Duffy?Patrick Duffy FischerYou bet. And then just on the announcement that the EPA was given to the state of Louisiana the authority to deal with the CO2 sequestration there. Roughly, can you kind of explain how your relationship is with the state and how quickly you think that will speed up the process there and when we might get permits for Louisiana?Seifollah GhasemiDuffy, I'm glad you asked that question. We are very excited about that. I think it was the right decision and that will cut about -- we think about a year on the time line of us getting the permit for the Class 6 well. And we do have an excellent relationship with the State of Louisiana, but it's not the relationship. We are going to do the right thing by having the State of Louisiana review that. We gain time because the State of Louisiana will have less Class 6 wells to deal with than EPA.So it's just a matter of the workload and they did the right thing by distributing the workload. Therefore, now the State of Louisiana will have fewer applications, and therefore, they can approve our project by about a year faster than the federal government would have done that. So that is why it is very helpful and very impactful and gives us a lot more confidence in terms of our ability to get the Class 6 permit if we need it.OperatorWe'll go to Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.Kevin William McCarthySeifi, I wanted to come back to the helium market dynamics. I heard your comments on the demand side. My question is, have you witnessed any material changes on the supply side of the global market such as the operating status of Gazprom's Amur project in Russia? Or is it strictly a function of demand in terms of the volume shortfall that you cited in the quarter?Seifollah GhasemiWell, that is a very good question. Theoretically, whatever Amur produces in Russia, theoretically there is global sanctions on that. That, that is not supposed to be getting into the market. Is it getting into the market illegally and therefore increasing the supply of helium, and therefore that is why people are buying from other people?It could be the case. I am not sure. But the detailed dynamics on that are. And I don't want to be interpreting sanctions laws and all of that. But what you are suggesting is a possibility. We are looking into that. We haven't seen any significant factor from that yet, and at least we don't see it yet, but it might be the case.Kevin William McCarthyOkay. That's helpful. And then secondly, I had a few sort of housekeeping questions possibly for Melissa. I think you mentioned devaluation of the Argentine peso and we talked about the cost overrun from the sale of equipment project. Can you quantify the impact of some of those issues in the quarter?Seifollah GhasemiI don't think we want to quantify the details of every one of them, but the Argentine currency is easy. I'll answer that, make it a lot easy for Melissa, is that effect was about $10 million on our bottom line, for the Argentine currency about $0.03.Kevin William McCarthyOkay. And the SOE, no comment on that one?Seifollah GhasemiNo, the rest of it, we don't want to break down how much was helium, how much was the sale of equipment and how much was the slowdown in China because then we will be giving you very too much competitive information, if you don't mind.OperatorWe'll go next to Patrick Cunningham from Citi.Patrick David CunninghamCould you maybe comment on the direction of price in Europe, how sustainable these margins are going forward?Seifollah GhasemiWell, quite frankly, we did -- that is one of the areas where we did better than we expected. Our results in Europe are excellent, the margins are up 1,000 basis points, and that is because people have done a good job hanging on to the price while energy prices are going down. How this will develop in the future obviously depends on what happens to energy prices and so on. But I'm very proud of our people in terms of their performance and in terms of making sure that they maintain the pricing and we have been successful. And as Dr. Serhan was saying, our European business did very well during the quarter.Patrick David CunninghamGreat. And then maybe just a related follow-up on the Uzbekistan project. How much volume was up on Uzbekistan? And what sort of contribution should we have throughout the year? I know previously you talked about $0.35 per share. How is Uzbekistan performing relative to your expectations?Seifollah GhasemiDr. Serhan, would you like to answer that?Samir Jawdat SerhanYes. I just want to start by saying this project really has been a great fit for both Air Products and Uzbekistan. It leverages our core competencies and address the country's desire for energy independence and socioeconomic development.This project includes the world's largest ATRs, auto thermal reformer. And just to remind everybody, to produce blue hydrogen, you need to use auto-thermal reformers and those are the largest in the world, or you need to use (inaudible) units, which are the (inaudible), which is the technology we bought from GE gasification.We are excited about the operational and technological synergies by operating these large ATRs. The asset was brought onstream in October '23. We expect that to contribute around $0.35 for the full year.Seifollah GhasemiOkay?OperatorWe'll go to Mike Sison from Wells Fargo.Michael Joseph SisonI guess my first question on fiscal '24 EPS growth, the projects that's recently come onstream before that you've noted in the slide, Are those contributing what you thought they would contribute in 2024? And I guess sort of the follow-up is that the delta between the 13% growth to the 6% to 9% growth now has nothing to do with the projects, more of the other stuff that you talked about in terms of headwinds?Seifollah GhasemiWell, the thing is that -- I don't like to give you a general answer in the sense that if you're up year-on-year and in the meantime China is going down, helium volumes are lower and we have had these headwinds, then the only reason that it's going up is because some of the other projects are contributing, of course. So that's the way I would like to leave it with you, okay? Because, (inaudible) negatives and they are still going up. Therefore, the other projects are contributing, yes.Michael Joseph SisonYes, that's great. And then beyond 2024, when you think about '25, '26, '27, more of a longer-term sort of view, how do you think the growth algorithm changes or maybe doesn't change as we look out of those years in terms of EPS growth?Seifollah GhasemiI think Air Products will deliver on the average an EPS growth of the 10% that we have delivered before. That's our goal. And one year, we might be 9%, one year we might be 11%. But overall, we are going to continue on that trend. And we promised that 10 years ago, we have delivered, and I fully expect that we will continue to deliver that.OperatorWe'll go to Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.Daniel RizzoThis is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. I just want to make sure that of the projects under execution that's listed on Page 19, the next one that's going to come online is the one in Alberta, Canada, correct?Seifollah GhasemiYes. Alberta, Canada is the next one, which is going to come onstream. And as Dr. Serhan said, we expect that to be in fiscal year 2025.Daniel RizzoAre there -- and this will be my second question, should the other projects come on right behind that? Or will there be, I don't know, year like delays? Or I'm just trying to think of the cadence as these are coming online.Seifollah GhasemiWell, after that, we will have in '26 -- by the end of fiscal year '26, we will have -- by the end of calendar '26, we will have our green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia. The year after that, we will have our blue hydrogen project in Louisiana. And the year after that, we will have hopefully other projects that we will announce.OperatorWe'll go next to Laurent Favre from BNP.Laurent Guy FavreI'd like to go back to the SAF project, actually. I think you just mentioned that the start-up would be in 2027. In May last year, you had in, I guess, for startup in '25. And in August, it was still part of the group of projects that should be up and running by 2026. So I was wondering if you could talk about, I guess, what are the specific reasons for this more than 1 year delay. Is it the customer side? Or is it execution on your side?Seifollah GhasemiWell, it is related to the fact that we are building this plant in California. And you know in California, it usually takes a long time to get permits. So it is dependent on the timing of the permits for construction for that facility. Once we have a final, final ruling on the permit, then we will be able to give you a definite date about when that plant is going to come onstream.Laurent Guy FavreAnd could you size for us the potential cost of a run on top of the $2.5 billion that was initially slated? Are we talking about a material difference?Seifollah GhasemiI'm not sure I understood the question.Siddharth ManjeshwarNo. I think Laurent, on that one, the capital, we earn the return on the capital of the project. We won't anticipate any capital update there.Seifollah GhasemiThe return on the project is fixed. We are going to get a return on the capital that we spent, no matter what the capital is. Okay?OperatorAnd we'll take our last question from Sebastian Bray from Berenberg.Sebastian Christian BrayMy first one is on merchant pricing as it stands today. Is this stable in Europe or the U.S.? Has it started to decline? Or has it started to go up? The answer seems to be stable, but I wanted to double check.My second one is on guidance. Are we just assuming when setting the EPS growth rate guided for '24 the dollar rates as they stand today hold for the rest of the year?My third one is a more philosophical question on pricing. Is the desire to wait longer for the clean ammonia and clean hydrogen project offtake agreements a reaction to try and hedge out for risk that IRA subsidies maybe changed from '25, i.e., if that industry shakes out and it turns out the projects need clean -- higher clean hydrogen pricing to be economic with fewer subsidies available? Is the APD approach to say, well, we'll wait for the industry to shake out and see what comes?Seifollah GhasemiWell, you're asking a very, very good question and I would like to tell you that we are the first mover in these projects. We are investing significant amount of money being the first mover. We -- obviously, my job is try to maximize return for the investors. And if we were the first mover and we took the risk, as they say, building these facilities before we had contracts, we should get rewarded by that and not just have projects which have the standard returns but be rewarded with a higher return. That's one thing.And then the second thing is that we genuinely believe that where we are in these projects, we will have a product which will be in significant demand as we get closer to people trying to comply with the rules that are already in place, in Europe especially. By 2028, a lot of the industries have to use the products that we make, and we don't see that many people making the product. So in that case, we are not in a hurry to give it away. Obviously, our job is to maximize profit for the company, get the best that we can, and that is the philosophy that we are following.It is not because of concerns about the other things that you mentioned, no. I think that the subsidies and so on are going to get enacted. Every day that goes by. You see the governments taking action. Recently it was Japan, before it has been Europe, it's well established, U.S. with the IRA. So events as you go forward every day points in the direction that hopefully our strategy is the right strategy, and we want to take maximum advantage of that.Samir Jawdat SerhanActually Seifi, there has been report from the International Energy Agency that indicated that out of all of the projects announced for green hydrogen by 2030 to come onstream, only 7% will eventually come onstream by 2030.Seifollah GhasemiOkay. Sorry, we gave you a long answer, but I hope we addressed your issue.Sebastian Christian BrayNo, it's appreciated, Seifi. And the merchant pricing and the question on FX assumption for the rest of the year on a more tactical or short-term basis.Seifollah GhasemiYes. Well, that's again a very good question. We make our estimate -- Melissa, why don't you answer that?Melissa N. SchaefferYes. So let me give you an answer on the merchant. So merchant-on-merchant pricing was up slightly. So we had stronger merchant-merchant pricing in the Americas and Asia, which was partially offset by some small decrease in Europe. However, I do want to mention that in Europe, our conversion margin stayed strong because the power cost decreased at a faster rate than our (technical difficulty) so the conversion margin maintain strong in all 3 regions.Seifollah GhasemiAnd with respect to FX, when we give you an estimate, we give you an estimate based on the exchange rates as of today. So that is -- we are not assuming any significant change in the exchange rate.Okay. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. Operator, since there are no other questions, I would like to thank everybody for joining our call today. We again appreciate your interest in Air Products, and we look forward to discussing our results with you in 3 months. All the very best, and thank you for listening.OperatorThat does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.Related Quotes`['APD']`

Decoding Amphenol Corp (APH): A Strategic SWOT Insight`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decoding-amphenol-corp-aph-strategic-050651155.html`2024-02-09 05:06:51`Amphenol Corp demonstrates robust market presence with a diverse product portfolio in interconnect and sensor systems.Strategic positioning in various industries, including automotive and IT datacom, drives consistent revenue streams.Geographical diversification and strong customer relationships bolster Amphenol's competitive edge.Global operations expose the company to geopolitical and economic risks, requiring vigilant management.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with DXCM.On February 7, 2024, Amphenol Corp (NYSE:APH), a global leader in connectors, sensors, and interconnect systems, filed its 10-K report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. With a market capitalization of approximately $44,189 million as of June 30, 2023, and a workforce of 95,000 employees, Amphenol Corp stands as a significant player in the technology sector. The company's financial performance reflects its strategic market positioning and operational excellence, with a diverse range of products sold across various industries, including automotive, broadband communications, commercial aerospace, and more. Amphenol's financial tables reveal a company that is not only managing its current assets and liabilities effectively but also investing in growth opportunities and maintaining a healthy balance sheet to support its strategic initiatives.Market Position and Diversified Portfolio: Amphenol Corp's strength lies in its second-largest global market share in the connector industry, a testament to its strong brand and innovative product range. The company's diversified portfolio, spanning harsh environment solutions, communications solutions, and interconnect and sensor systems, allows it to mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations. This diversification is further reflected in its sales distribution, with significant contributions from the automotive (23%), industrial (25%), and IT datacom (19%) markets, showcasing a balanced revenue stream that enhances stability.Global Reach and Customer Relationships: With operations in 40 countries, Amphenol Corp's geographical diversification is a key strength. This global footprint not only provides access to emerging markets but also reduces dependency on any single region. The company's long-standing customer relationships, built on a foundation of comprehensive design capabilities and high-quality service, contribute to its strong market position. These relationships facilitate collaborative product development, allowing Amphenol to stay ahead of technological trends and customer demands.Dependence on Specific Markets: Despite its diversified portfolio, Amphenol Corp's significant revenue dependence on the automotive, industrial, and IT datacom markets could be a potential weakness. Any downturn in these industries could disproportionately affect the company's financial performance. Additionally, the company's focus on high-performance interconnect systems and components means that it must continuously invest in R&D to maintain its competitive edge, which could strain resources if not managed effectively.Operational Risks in Global Markets: Amphenol's extensive international operations expose it to risks associated with geopolitical tensions, trade policies, and economic instability. With a substantial portion of its workforce and sales outside the United States, the company must navigate complex regulatory environments and manage supply chain risks, which could impact operational efficiency and cost structures.Technological Advancements and Market Growth: The ongoing evolution of technology, particularly in the automotive and IT datacom sectors, presents significant opportunities for Amphenol Corp. The shift towards hybrid and electric vehicles, along with the proliferation of high-speed and fiber optic technologies, opens up new markets for the company's advanced interconnect products. Furthermore, the expansion of 5G networks and the increasing demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning systems offer avenues for growth.Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: Amphenol Corp has the opportunity to further solidify its market position through strategic acquisitions and partnerships. By acquiring complementary businesses or forming alliances, the company can expand its product offerings, enter new markets, and leverage synergies to enhance its competitive advantage.Intense Competition and Technological Disruption: The interconnect and sensor markets are highly competitive, with constant pressure to innovate. Amphenol Corp faces the threat of technological disruption and must continually adapt to changing customer preferences and technological advancements. Competitors with more agile innovation processes or disruptive technologies could erode Amphenol's market share.Regulatory and Environmental Challenges: Amphenol Corp operates in a regulatory environment that is becoming increasingly stringent, particularly concerning environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. Compliance with new regulations, such as those related to climate change and sustainability, could result in additional costs and operational challenges. Moreover, failure to meet these standards could damage the company's reputation and lead to financial penalties.In conclusion, Amphenol Corp (NYSE:APH) exhibits a strong market position with a diversified product portfolio and global reach, which are central to its operational strengths. However, the company must address its reliance on specific markets and manage the risks associated with its international operations. Opportunities for growth are abundant, driven by technological advancements and potential strategic acquisitions. Nonetheless, Amphenol must remain vigilant against competitive pressures and regulatory challenges that pose threats to its business. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, while capitalizing on opportunities and mitigating threats, Amphenol Corp is well-positioned to navigate the dynamic landscape of the interconnect and sensor markets.This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

What Makes Amphenol (APH) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-amphenol-aph-strong-momentum-170005909.html`2024-02-02 17:00:05`"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Amphenol (APH), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Amphenol currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for APH that show why this maker of fiber-optic products shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For APH, shares are up 3.18% over the past week while the Zacks Electronics - Connectors industry is up 2.01% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.23% compares favorably with the industry's 2.93% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Amphenol have risen 20.41%, and are up 24.77% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 16.26% and 20.81%, respectively.Investors should also take note of APH's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, APH is averaging 2,595,284 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with APH.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost APH's consensus estimate, increasing from $3.19 to $3.25 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that APH is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Amphenol on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Amphenol Corporation (APH) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amphenol-corporation-aph-hit-52-141513028.html`2024-01-31 14:15:13`Shares of Amphenol (APH) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 6.1% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $103.07 in the previous session. Amphenol has gained 3.7% since the start of the year compared to the 63.2% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 33.1% return for the Zacks Electronics - Connectors industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on January 24, 2024, Amphenol reported EPS of $0.82 versus consensus estimate of $0.77 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 5.89%.For the current fiscal year, Amphenol is expected to post earnings of $3.25 per share on $13.15 billion in revenues. This represents a 7.97% change in EPS on a 4.71% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.59 per share on $14.03 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.21% and 6.71%, respectively.Valuation MetricsAmphenol may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Amphenol has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 31.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 55.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 27X versus its peer group's average of 6.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 3.64. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Amphenol currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Amphenol meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Amphenol shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:APO) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 8, 2024Apollo Global Management, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.91, expectations were $1.72. Apollo Global Management, Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Apollo Global Management's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call which management believes are relevant in assessing financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund. I will now turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Noah Gunn: Great. Thanks, Donna. And welcome again, everyone, to our call. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the investor relations portion of our website. And in short, fourth quarter results rounded out an exceptionally strong year for both our asset management and retirement services businesses. Our 2 primary earnings streams, fee-related earnings and spread-related earnings, grew more than 25% to a record $4.9 billion in 2023. Combined with principal investing income, HoldCo financing costs and taxes, we reported record adjusted net income of $4.1 billion or $6.74 per share for the full year. One change to highlight in our financial reporting included with this morning's results.Beginning this quarter, within retirement services, you'll see spread-related earnings excluding notable items. And further down the page, we provide additional information highlighting the delta to arrive at our long-term return expectation for Athene's alternative investments. This information is useful in order to understand how we think about Athene's earnings power on a multiyear basis excluding quarterly mark-to-market fluctuations. And importantly, this change has no impact on historically reported SRE or the magnitude of historically reported notable items. So joining me to discuss our strong results in more detail and outlook for the year ahead are Marc Rowan, CEO; Scott Kleinman, co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. And with that, I'll hand over to Marc.Marc Rowan: Thanks, Noah. And it's my pleasure to actually walk through what was a very strong year both in growth and execution. If you had told me at the beginning of the year that we were going to grow 25%-plus in FRE and 26% in SRE and that we would do that successfully, we would be doing a victory lap here; and I assure you we are, in fact, doing that victory lap. Those ranges, while I wish they were recurring every year, are not the normal expectation you should have for the business. We've consistently guided all of our investors to what I believe and we believe is a long-term growth rate in FRE, which is 15% to 20% in a non-flagship year; and to low double-digit growth in SRE. 2023 was truly exceptional. Recall that, particularly in our SRE segment in our retirement services segment, we are not a near-term profit maximizer.2023 was extraordinary. We ended the year holding more than $12 billion of cash. We also used the very strong results to begin the creation of a countercyclical portfolio, which had us for the first time in a long time make a significant move into treasuries. While this costs us near-term SRE, it gives us flexibility to redeploy into very strong origination volumes, which you will hear about. In the third quarter, just -- excuse me. In the fourth quarter, just to highlight how strong originations volumes were, we did north of $30 billion of originations. We hope to continue up that pace. And having a pile of cash and a treasury portfolio will allow us to continue to grow SRE in the low double digits, which is what we seek to do. Away from earnings.Margins were up over 200 basis points. AUM hit a record $651 billion. Inflows were $160 billion. And Athene had record inflows of $66 billion. Even in inflows, Athene is not a near-term profit maximizer. This was an opportunity to really shape the kind of business and the kind of distribution that Athene wanted. And we would expect to exceed this number in terms of originations, organic originations, for Athene moving into 2024. 2024, we see as a year of continued momentum, but we also see it taking shape slightly differently than 2023. Credit, we believe, will dominate 2024. Growth at Athene and equity strategies other than PE. Martin will spend time in his remarks discussing the '24 outlook and the finer details of Q4. I thought what I would do is spend my time and provide a little bit of historical perspective and road map as to where we're going.We've just come back from our partners retreat, where all 201 Apollo partners get together and we discuss the outlook. And I began those remarks by anchoring people in history. In 2008, we were $44 billion of AUM. You fast forward. We've grown 14x. That's faster than Apple's revenue. That's faster than Microsoft's revenue. That's faster than semiconductors, truly extraordinary. I'd like to think that was all as a result of management acumen and management positioning, but we are the beneficiary of macro industry factors that drove not just us but our entire industry. Dodd-Frank; substantial money printing; for excess return in a low rate environment; and the commoditization of debt and equity markets, public markets, through indexation and correlation were the powerful tailwinds that drove our industry and allowed us to grow 14x.Some of these factors are still here, but I have to say the factors that are going to drive us going forward are different than the factors that in fact got us to 2023. As I think about the big drivers of our business, first, I think there is a fundamental rethink going on as to the difference between public and private. Most of us have grown up in an investment world where private was risky and public was safe. We had a private allocation, an alternatives bucket, illiquid allocation. And it was generally a relatively small portion of an institution or an individual's total strategic asset allocation and with good reason. Private, at least in the old days, was risky. Private equity, venture capital and hedge funds dominated the private bucket.On the other hand, public was perceived as safe. Stocks and bonds 60-40 portfolio world where public is both safe and risky and private is safe and risky; and the difference is only a matter of liquidity. I believe we are going to see a substantial pivot from institutions where they begin to think about private not just in a traditional alternatives context, but they think about private as just another investment that has a little less liquidity. And the question they'll be asking is, ""Am I being compensated for slightly less liquidity?"" I think that is nothing but a positive for our industry and for our firm. The second is this continued commoditization of public market returns. We are at an extreme of indexation and concentration and correlation.Not just between debt and equity markets, but so much of our equity market is dominated by a handful of companies that -- with outsized valuations and outsized PE that really do drive the public indices. While that's going up, that feels great. That can just as easily go in the other direction. Sophisticated investors, institutional and individual, understand this. And if they are seeking to separate themselves from the beta of the public markets and look for alpha, they will need to look for other solutions other than those in the public markets and through indexation. High net worth and the entry of individual investors into the private markets and alternatives. We are in the earliest early days of this. This hasn't even started. This is a $65 trillion market that ultimately has the potential for private markets investors such as ourselves and our peer group to be as large, if not larger than, our institutional market.For us to get there, it's going to take education. We are evangelical in this because what private investments can do for an investor's portfolio is well substantiated academically and through financial records, but the level of understanding of how private investments can be incorporated into these portfolios is very, very immature. I look at the largest pool of investable capital anywhere in the world, some $12 trillion in 401(k). These are the people in our country who need returns the most, and we force them to be daily liquid for 50 years. Why? I don't know why. I don't think there's a good reason why. And we're beginning to see cracks even in the 401(k) market of an allocation to private, which is different than an allocation to risk, but again I think this is a very powerful trend that bodes well for our firm and for our industry.Finally, that we're all getting older. Our society is getting older. Europe is getting older. Japan is getting older. Australia is getting older. Most Western markets are getting older. Most markets have done a very poor job of retirement savings. The retirement savings crisis in the U.S. is particularly acute. The numbers are well known. And I believe there is a substantial role for firms such as ours to play in [indiscernible] investor savings and allowing them to -- allowing us to provide them guaranteed lifetime income. In short, we find ourselves at $650 billion as a relatively small entity in the scheme of asset management, surrounded by 4 massive markets. The market for fixed income replacement. Think of this as a rotation institutions' and individuals' normal fixed income portfolios into private as well as public, so-called private investment grade.The second is the high net worth market, moving from traditional [indiscernible] 60-40 allocation into private market allocation. The third is rotations out of active management and into other products; and finally, the retirement market. Each of those markets offers us the opportunity to double our firm over a number of years. We just have to make sure that we are well positioned, that we make the investments today; and accept that the tailwinds that powered us to 2023 are not the same as the tailwinds that are likely to power us going forward, that the products that powered us to where we are, are not exactly the same as the products that are going to power us going forward. Fundamentally, we need to embrace change, but I like the position that we're starting from.We're starting from the only scaled player in private IG, a leading retirement services footprint, the largest hybrid ecosystem, all of which is fueled by origination, so what do we need to do? And what should you be looking for as milestones for whether in fact we are proceeding positively toward a path to take advantage of the opportunities that surround our industry and surround our firm? By far, the most important thing that we need to do is scale our origination. As you know, we have been running at roughly $100 billion of annual origination, $30 billion of which came in the fourth quarter. We need to rapidly move that up, with a goal of somewhere between $200 billion and $250 billion of origination 5 years from now. As an alternative firms that provides excess return per unit of risk, we can only grow as fast as we scale our capacity to create investments that in fact offer our clients excess return per unit of risk.If we grow too fast or simply seek to gather assets, we will commoditize our business, and ultimately we will not like the results of that, so origination, probably first and second. Capital formation. Not only do we need to continue to build out our high net worth coverage, but if we are going to serve fixed income replacement, so-called private investment grade, the sale, the way things are sold, the client base is actually completely different than the traditional client base of an alternatives firm. Building out a fixed income replacement sales force that speaks to clients in a language that they are used to speaking in [indiscernible] necessary ingredients to scale this and not just pick around the edges. Finally, new products and product creation are the heart of financial services.If I go back and look at the beginning of my 40-year career now: Levered loans, high-yield bonds, ETFs, securitized product either did not exist or in their infancy. We take for granted these 4 products as completely mainstream and dominant products, but we should not be naive to think that they are going to be the products that dominate 15 years from now. Clients and high-net-worth individuals are going to move out of public equities. I do not believe they are going to move into 10-year [indiscernible] private partnerships. I believe they're going to move into things that are more hybrid. Hybrid, again, is the midpoint between debt and equity. [Indiscernible] to offer clients non-binary outcomes while still providing attractive rates of return.The product set here, while large for us, is immature for the entire industry. And I think you will see this year introductions of new products with risk-rewards and liquidity requirements and partnerships has not seen before [indiscernible] that we and our peer group are hard at work trying to meet the needs of our investors. And truthfully could not be more excited about where we sit in this ecosystem. We are beginning to talk about our original 5-year plan in hindsight. Martin and Scott will provide some context that we are well on our way and confident of meeting the objectives that we put up in our 5-year plan. We are spending 2024 positioning ourselves to take advantage of the next new trends [indiscernible] we'll be there going forward, but it will not look like [indiscernible] the growth of the past.It will come differently but no less -- I'm no less optimistic. Finally, we're looking forward to a full Investor Day, and with us you know the definition of full means long, in October of this year. And Martin and Noah will provide you details. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.Scott Kleinman: Thanks, Marc. Echoing Marc's sentiment. We entered 2023 focused squarely on executing the growth plan we set forth, and we achieved those goals. Both our asset management and retirement services business proved resilient and often opportunistic as we navigated an uncertain investing backdrop, a changing rate paradigm and an evolving financial ecosystem. One thing that stayed constant, though, was our commitment to delivering excess return per unit of risk for our clients. Investment performance across our product suite was strong, with particularly robust returns in certain yields and hybrid strategies. For example, our direct origination portfolio appreciated 20% over the full year, while our hybrid value portfolio, credit strategies and accord funds all returned more than 15% in 2023.In our PE business, our flagship fund performance remains very solid, with Fund IX generating a gross IRR of 32% and 22% net life to-date through year-end. Importantly, we've been able to generate these attractive returns while prioritizing senior secured investment grade credit quality and a ""purchase price matters"" investment philosophy. Off the back of this strong investment performance, we're seeing growing demand for our investment solutions in the marketplace. We raised $44 billion of third-party capital in 2023, an annual record when excluding flagship PE activity, reflecting the increasing breadth of our product suite. Athene's organic inflows continued to heights, totaling $63 billion in 2023, driven by strong secular tailwinds and leading market share.Approximately $23 billion or 35% of Athene's inflows were supported by continued growth through third-party sidecar capital. All together, organic inflows totaled $107 billion across the platform during the year. As we look to 2024, we expect momentum across all avenues of capital formation to continue. In our third-party asset management business, we expect to raise a record $50 billion of capital, including annual fundraising records from both the institutional and global wealth channels. Coupled with the $70 billion of expected inflows from Athene, we expect to raise approximately $120 billion of capital this year organically, which would represent an increase of 20% on a comparable basis excluding flagship PE. In a higher interest rate backdrop and with lingering impacts of the effect on traditional private equity allocations, institutional investor focus has pivoted to asset classes that offer current income, inflation protection and access to areas of secular growth, namely credit, infrastructure and sustainability.We believe we're well positioned to capture this demand with our direct lending, asset-backed finance, opportunistic credit and infrastructure equity strategies currently in the market in addition to our first-time clean transition equity fund. We're also focused on building upon the success we've had with third-party insurers last year, who entrusted us with $13 billion of capital, and view this as an important client segment as we continue to scale our third-party credit platform. Overall, we've entered 2024 with a lot of momentum and expect a very strong first quarter for institutional fundraising. Turning to global wealth. We closed out a transformative year for the business from launching new products, expanding distribution and educating the marketplace on the benefits of alternative assets.We raised over $8 billion of capital from this channel in 2023, up more than 30% from 2022 levels, and expect to grow off that base in 2024 despite not having a flagship private equity fund in the market. We believe our growing suite of semi-liquid perpetual products is important to that success, with a few to highlight in particular. We've seen steadily growing inflows for Apollo Debt Solutions, the nontraded BDC we manage, which totaled $875 million in the fourth quarter, in addition to approximately $345 million for January 1 subscriptions, a recent monthly record. These strong inflows follow industry-leading investment performance, with Class I shares delivering an approximate 16% net return for 2023; as well as expanding distribution, with ADS now live on 5 global wirehouse platforms and 60-plus selling agreements in place with independent advisers.Looking forward, we're focused on expanding our private credit offering from corporate direct lending to asset-backed finance, which we believe will provide global wealth investors more fulsome and diversified access to our proprietary asset origination capabilities. Additionally, we're pleased with the growth we've seen in AAA, our innovative core equity replacement vehicle. Inflows from global wealth investors totaled $1.5 billion in 2023, though weighted towards the second half of the year. Looking ahead, we're focused on expanding shelf space to additional key distributors in the U.S. and Europe as well as launching additional points of access to reach different parts of the retail market. And lastly, Apollo Infrastructure Company recently launched in November to capture growing demand for private infrastructure assets.We believe the company offers differentiated access to the full spectrum of our infra platform investing across sectors and the capital structure. Initial feedback from RIAs has been positive, so far, and AIC is on track to expand distribution more broadly over the course of this year. Turning to investment activity. We had an active year of capital deployment totaling approximately $150 billion in 2023. Looking forward, we expect many of the same themes that informed our investment pipeline last year to remain pertinent in 2024, a shrinking global banking industry, lack of public market liquidity and the need for structured financing alternatives, among others. With $58 billion of dry powder at year-end, we're well equipped to capitalize on this robust opportunity set.Relatedly, debt origination volume totaled almost $100 billion in 2023, as Marc said, including $30 billion in the fourth quarter alone. It's worth mentioning that about half of this volume in both the fourth quarter and full year originated from our ecosystem of 16 proprietary platforms. Over the next couple of years, we're focused on reaching our $150 billion debt target, origination debt target, that we first laid out at Investor Day. To reach that target, scaling our origination platform volume is essential and should encompass around 50% of that longer-term goal. We think we can achieve this platform volume goal by scaling our existing portfolio, especially through some of the larger platforms like Atlas and MidCap and mid-sized platforms like Wheels and .Importantly, growth in debt origination volume has helped fuel our capital solutions business. In 2023, more than 80% of capital solutions fees were debt related, up from only 55% in 2021. Our growing high-grade alpha business is one of the important contributors to this fee mix shift, which generated approximately $10 billion of volume over the full year. In the fourth quarter specifically, we announced 3 transactions with repeat borrowers, Air France, and Vonovia, showcasing the power of incumbency for large-scale structured investment-grade financing demand. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin to go through our financials.Martin Kelly: Great. Thank you, Scott. And good morning, everyone. So as demonstrated by our results, 2023 was a very successful year of growth and execution for Apollo. We delivered on the financial targets that we laid out more than a year ago despite operating in a vastly different macro environment. In the asset management business, we achieved our 25% FRE growth target through fee revenue growth of more than 20%, coupled with decelerating expense growth, which drove the 200 basis points of margin expansion. In retirement services, we grew SRE by 26%. As Noah mentioned, you'll note a new presentation this quarter, on Page 10 of the earnings release, to separate SRE excluding notable items, which this quarter is $748 million or 141 basis points of net spread, from the difference between actual alts returns and the 11% long-term expectation, which this quarter is $132 million or 25 basis points of net spread.This change in presentation reflects both where the industry is moving to and is being required to move to, as a presentation format. Importantly, we still continue to manage the portfolio expecting the same 11% long-term returns. On this basis, our net spread, excluding notable items, for the year was 144 basis points. Considering our long-term expectations for alternatives returns, our net spread would be an additional 21 basis points higher and, combined, 30 basis points higher in 2023 versus 2022. Assisted by higher rates, this increase was driven by record organic growth, a favorable deployment backdrop and floating-rate income. With these strong results across the business, we expect to exceed our stated goal of doubling our total earnings to $5.5 billion by 2026.And we expect a mid-teens-plus compound earnings growth trajectory over the next few years. Executing on our plan for 2024 is the next important milestone to achieving that target. Before I get into the forward look, I'd like to discuss a few puts and takes in our fourth quarter results that will help form a better view of our run rate earnings power. On management fees: Management fees declined modestly quarter-over-quarter due to Fund X catch-up fees of approximately $25 million earned in the third quarter. Athene's alternatives portfolio returned 6.5% annualized in the fourth quarter, below our long-term expectation of 11%, with strong performance by the strategic origination platforms partially offset by other investments held outside AAA.Our operating tax rate benefited from large deductions related to employee stock compensation due to a higher share price as well as onetime benefits related to Athene's redomicile and new corporate tax legislation in December. Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to remain approximately 20% over the long term, subject to quarterly variability. And then lastly, Athene's cost of funds in the third quarter included a 17 basis point benefit from 2 items that we previously adjusted out as notable items. Q4 also included the full year costs of a new performance fee, which amounted to 7 basis points of costs in Q4. Combining these items provides a more appropriate comparison of the quarter-over-quarter change in cost of funds, which including these adjustments was similar to the change in fixed income returns for the quarter.So turning to our FRE outlook. We expect 15% to 20% growth, as Marc communicated. I'll walk through the key building blocks. Excluding $45 million of cyclical catch-up fees we earned in 2023 related to our flagship PE fund raise Fund X, we expect low- to mid-teens fee revenue growth in 2024 primarily driven by increasing management fees and fee-related performance fees. We expect management fee growth to be supported by the $120 billion of total organic inflows Scott highlighted as well as solid levels of capital deployment, further supported by $46 billion of fee-eligible AUM not yet earning management fees. For capital solutions, we expect another strong year of fee revenue generation currently similar to 2023 levels. The revenue from this business has grown approximately 80% in 2 years and has already exceeded our 5-year target.For expenses, we estimate our growth rate in total fee-related expenses will moderate this year to a low double-digit level. We added approximately 350 people to our total head count in 2023, at the asset manager, with approximately half the net new hires located in North America and Europe and the other half in Mumbai. We expect very targeted head count growth this year in our business, with a continued focus on growing our India team. As the pace of growth in our head count declines, we should experience a commensurate favorable slowdown in the pace of non-comp expense growth. Combining this expense outlook with a solid revenue growth picture, we expect to derive an additional 100 basis points improvement in our FRE margin to approximately 57 basis points this year, on a path to 60%-plus by 2026.Moving to retirement services. We expect to generate low double-digit growth in SRE this year based on a few underlying criteria. In terms of basis, the growth outlook is built upon the exclusion of any notables and assumes an 11% return on Athene's alternatives portfolio in line with historical experience, adjusting for the approximate $70 million of excess earnings we earned in 2023 on assets related to the ADIP buydowns and the Venerable recapture, both as we previously communicated; of organic inflows funded with existing capital resources, including third-party sidecar capital; and net spread, excluding any notable items and assuming an 11% return [indiscernible], of between 160 and 165 basis points, based on the current forward rate curve which implies approximately 5 rate cuts by the end of 2024.As it relates to interest rates and sensitivity. Athene has had a long-standing and intentional allocation to floating-rate securities while remaining duration matched. Holding floaters has and will continue to serve a range of strategic purposes, including assisting with asset-liability matching, enabling offensive positioning within the asset portfolio during periods of market stress and cushioning it against any . With the prospect of a Fed easing cycle on the horizon, we have reduced the amount of net floating-rate assets to $25 billion at year-end; and we expect it to further decline to $20 billion by the end of the first quarter. Turning to principal investing briefly. We expect our PII earnings stream to be below our multiyear average target of $1 per share in 2024, with clear dependencies on both the public and private markets for monetizations and outcomes.On capital allocation, our priorities remain unchanged. We're focused on investing in our existing capabilities to drive continued organic growth rather than making strategic investments. We also expect to continue immunizing regular-way employee stock comp grants and to begin taking steps to reduce our share count to 600 million shares by the end of 2026. We have also announced an increase in the annual dividend by 7.5% to $1.85 per share, beginning with the first quarter of 2024, implying a dividend yield of 1.8%, slightly above the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 of 1.5%.

Apollo Ramps Up Private Credit Targets After Record Earnings`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apollo-ramps-private-credit-targets-163637613.html`2024-02-08 22:30:09`(Bloomberg) -- Apollo Global Management Inc. Chief Executive Officer Marc Rowan took a “victory lap” on the firm’s record year, laying out goals to double its private credit origination business and put that asset class into retirement accounts.Most Read from BloombergBiden’s Attempt to Address Memory Issue Backfires With New GaffeA 99% Bond Wipeout Hands Hedge Funds a Harsh Lesson on ChinaChina’s Property Crisis Is Starting to Ripple Across the WorldNew York City Is Considering a Laundry Pods CrackdownPutin Takes Hard Line on Ukraine in Tucker Carlson InterviewThe firm posted record annual earnings, beating Wall Street estimates as higher interest rates powered growth at the credit-focused alternative-asset manager. Originating private credit assets to sell to its Athene annuities business, other insurance companies and individual investors is crucial for the firm’s growth, Rowan said.Apollo aims to raise its annual origination of private credit to $200 billion to $250 billion in five years, up from about $100 billion, he said on a conference call Thursday.“We can only grow as fast as we scale our capacity to create investments that in fact offer our clients excess return per unit of risk,” Rowan said.Apollo owns 16 platforms that create private credit investments and many have room to double their business — including MidCap Financial and Atlas SP, he said.The firm took in $8 billion during the year in its wealth business, including $1.5 billion to its equity-like Apollo Aligned Alternatives fund that invests across Apollo strategies.Risk MentalityThe firm is starting to see openings to put its wealth products into 401(k) accounts, Rowan indicated.“The 401(k) market is not limited by legal restriction,” he said. “It’s limited by a risk mentality.”Shares of Apollo rose 1.4% to a record high of $107.41, extending their gain this year to 15%.Apollo generated more net income in 2023 than it did over the previous decade as investors poured money into private credit amid higher interest rates and volatile public markets, including slower leveraged-loan and high-yield markets. More than 80% of the firm’s assets under management are in credit.Adjusted net income in the fourth quarter surged 31% to $1.18 billion, or $1.91 a share, the New York-based company said Thursday in a statement. That topped the $1.72 average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Fee-related earnings rose 16% to $457 million as Apollo’s 10th flagship private equity fund began to invest, mitigating an 18% decline in fees earned by its capital solutions unit.Spread-related earnings, which reflect profitability at the firm’s Athene insurance business, climbed 7.2% to $748 million. Athene’s net investment spread, or income from investing, rose 6% to $959 million, with gains in fixed income offsetting a slide in equity investments in the Athene portfolio.Investors should expect 15% to 20% fee-related earnings growth and “low double-digit growth” this year in spread-related earnings, Chief Financial Officer Martin Kelly said on the conference call.PE ExitsThe firm took a more muted tone than some of its peers on the prospect for private equity exits. Principal investing income from selling private equity assets will fall below the multiyear average target of $1 a share in 2024, Kelly said.Apollo reported $83 million of principal investing income from selling assets in 2023, a 71% decline from the previous year.The firm took in $32 billion of gross inflows during the fourth quarter, including $22 billion at Athene. Apollo expects to raise $120 billion in 2024, with $50 billion coming into asset management and $70 billion into Athene, Co-President Scott Kleinman said. The firm, which ended the year with $651 billion of assets under management, is targeting $1 trillion by 2026.Apollo originated $30 billion of private credit assets during the quarter, with about half coming from its origination platforms such as Atlas SP.Other fourth-quarter highlights:Principal investing income from selling private equity assets gained 89% to $51 millionThe direct origination portfolio gained 5.4% while the flagship private fund strategy rose 2.5%European principal finance fell 3.8%Dry powder totaled $58 billion at year-end(Updates with closing share price in ninth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekOpenAI’s Secret Weapon Is Sam Altman’s 33-Year-Old LieutenantHow Jack Dorsey’s Plan to Get Elon Musk to Save Twitter Went SouthInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went WrongA Tiny Fund Takes a Big Short on Corporate Debt Maturity WallLagging Fertility Rate Means Diapers Aren’t Just for Babies Anymore©2024 Bloomberg L.P.Related Quotes`['APO-PA']`

At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to the company’s Chief Executive Officer, Stuart Rothstein.Stuart Rothstein: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you to those of you joining us on the Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined as usual today by Scott Weiner, our Chief Investment Officer; and Anastasia Mironova, our Chief Financial Officer. In many ways, the start of 2024 feels very much like where we were at the start of 2023 for the commercial real estate sector. If you recall, entering 2023, there was significant negative sentiment concerning commercial real estate, fueled by concerns over the impact of elevated interest rates on valuations and pending debt maturities, uncertainty on the long-term use case for office properties and a lot of consensus with respect to both the path of the economy and the future trajectory of interest rates.The Fed continuing to raise rates in the first half of 2023 and the notable volatility in the 10-year treasury rates further added to the concern and uncertainty in the market. In addition, the failure of several notable regional banks, coupled with increased reserves and negative commentary from money center banks regarding their real estate portfolios further added to the generally pessimistic perspective. While there were some notable transactions throughout 2023, which started the process of revaluing real estate in a higher interest rate environment, but overall transaction volume was significantly lower than recent years as market participants, including owners, lenders, potential buyers and sellers all chose to play for time and remain cautious in the face of an uncertain economic and interest rate environment.As we enter 2024, there is increasing confidence in the Fed’s ability to engineer some type of soft landing and expectations of 100 to 150 bps of Fed rate cuts throughout the year. On the long end, the 10-year is essentially exactly where it was at the beginning of 2023. And at present, fears of that rate moving higher, as it quickly did last year, are muted. However, while there may be more optimism with respect to the economy and rates, the narrative around commercial real estate continues to focus on further asset value degradation. There is still much to be done to address loan maturities and asset level capital structures in a higher rate environment in addition to the lingering uncertainty over the long-term use case for certain assets.Pivoting away from the value debate, operating performance across much of commercial real estate has remained stable to positive. Notable exceptions include certain office markets as well as pockets of the multifamily sector that have begun to experience declining rent growth in the face of elevated supply. Over the long-term, we expect that property level operating performance will be closely aligned with the broader macroeconomic climate, and many property sectors will benefit from a notable decrease in new supply over the last few years. With respect to ARI, 2023 was a year focused on proactive asset management and maintaining excess liquidity while expanding and diversifying financing sources. Given the tailwinds from higher base rates, ARI achieved strong distributable earnings, which comfortably covered the dividend and demonstrated the earnings power of the company’s floating rate loan portfolio.During the fourth quarter, ARI strategically pivoted and deployed $536 million into two new loan transactions and the upsizing of an existing loan as we identified compelling opportunities to originate loans at attractive pricing with recent valuation, strong credit structures and lower LTVs. All three of these loans secured properties in Europe. Shifting to the portfolio. At year-end, ARI had 50 loans, totaling $8.4 billion. ARI received $1.2 billion in loan repayments and sales during 2023, including $270 million from office loans. Throughout the year, our team remained actively engaged with ARI’s borrowers, negotiating and completing paydowns and extensions where appropriate. For ARI’s focus assets, the 2 REO hotels produced stable cash flow throughout the year, with the Washington, D.C. asset generating NOI from hotel operations above pre-pandemic levels.With respect to Steinway, we closed on the sale of 1 unit in the fourth quarter, and there are 2 more units under contract. There are also active negotiations on a handful of additional units. However, nothing is done until it is done. Based on recent activity at the building, our views have not changed with respect to the nominal achievable value on sellout. But as a reminder, accounting does require a present value assessment of achievable value. Recent activity was generally consistent with previous estimates, and as such, no additional reserve was recorded during the fourth quarter. Any future change to the reserve level will be based upon assessment of both the potential nominal value of remaining units as well as the expected timing of realization.Before I turn the call over to Anastasia, let me make a few comments on ARI’s quarterly dividend. As a reminder, our quarterly dividend run rate is $0.35 per share, and it has been at that level since we proactively reduced the dividend right at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. As I have stated many times previously, the dividend is ultimately dependent on board action, and it is reviewed and discussed and ultimately declared by the Board on a quarterly basis. While it is subject to that Board approval, at present, our current modeling for the future indicates that we remain comfortable with the current dividend level of $0.35 per share. We will obviously review it with the Board on a go-forward basis, but in light of questions that we anticipated, I wanted to provide that context at this time.With that, I will turn the question over to Anastasia.Anastasia Mironova: Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. ARI had a strong year of operating results in 2023. Reported distributable earnings of $244 million or $1.69 per share, which resulted in dividend coverage of 1.21x. GAAP net income available to common stockholders was $46 million or $0.29 per diluted share of common stock. ARI portfolio ended the year with a carrying value of $8.4 billion, with a weighted average unlevered yield of 8.7%, 110 basis points higher than at the end of 2022, and notably, 380 basis points higher than at the end of 2021. As Stuart mentioned, during the quarter, we closed $536 million of new commitments across three deals. $275 million of these commitments was funded during the quarter.$212 million was funded subsequent to quarter end, and the rest will be funded in the future. We also completed $131 million of add-on fundings from previously closed loans and received $205 million in loan repayments. As of year-end, approximately 81% of the principal balance of our portfolio was covered by interest rate caps. Important to note that most cap expirations are tied to the initial of final maturity of loans, where a part of the extension conditions for the loans include putting a new cap in place. We closely monitor pending expirations and engage with our borrowers to ensure new caps are put in place upon expiration. Currently, there are not any loans in our portfolio in which we are concerned with the borrower’s ability to replace an expiring cap.In addition to interest rate caps, other structural protections for the loans in our portfolio include interest reserves and interest and carry guarantees. As of year-end, the weighted average risk rating of the portfolio was a 3.0. There was no incremental specific CECL allowance taken during the quarter. The general CECL loans stood at 38 basis points of the loan portfolio’s amortized cost basis at December 31, a 2 basis points increase as compared to a year ago. The increase in general CECL allowance was primarily attributable to a more adverse macroeconomic outlook, particularly in relation to certain asset classes. The negative impact from the macroeconomic outlook was partially offset by overall portfolio seasoning and loan repayment activity outpacing loan fundings.Notably, the outstanding principal balance of the loan portfolio decreased from $8.9 billion to $8.6 billion over the course of the year. As of December 31, our total CECL allowance was 261 basis points of the loan portfolios amortized cost basis. ARI book value per share, excluding general CECL reserves and depreciation, was $14.73, relatively flat to last quarter. With respect to our borrowings, we are in compliance with all covenants and continue to maintain strong liquidity. ARI repeated $176 million of the remaining outstanding principal balance of convertible notes that came due in October with cash on hand. With this repayment, our next corporate debt maturity is not until 2026. Picking up on Stuart’s remarks with regards to our Washington D.C. hotel, as we continue to monitor the market to determine the optimal time to sell the asset, the hotel was recently pledged to our revolving credit facility, generating an incremental leverage return for ARI.ARI ended the quarter with $278 million of total liquidity comprised of cash on hand on drawing credit capacity on existing facilities and loan proceeds held by the servicer. ARI’s debt-to-equity ratio at quarter end was at 3.0x. And with that, we’d like to open the line for questions. Operator, please go ahead.See also 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners and Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.Related Quotes`['ARI']`

Allegheny Technologies (ATI) Loses -11.75% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why a Trend Reversal May be Around the Corner`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/allegheny-technologies-ati-loses-11-143506461.html`2024-02-02 14:35:06`Allegheny Technologies (ATI) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 11.8% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for ATIThe RSI reading of 26.87 for ATI is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering ATI in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 2.3% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Moreover, ATI currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

Excluding full year 2023 voluntary defined benefit pension contributions of $272 million, cash provided by operating activities would have been $358 million.  Continued efforts to focus on operational improvements are positively impacting the inventory intensity of our business and alleviating the required investment of managed working capital in our growing business.  Fourth quarter 2023 managed working capital as a percent of sales was 31.1%.  Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $53 million and full year capital expenditures were $201 million.Cash on hand at December 31, 2023 was $744 million, and available additional liquidity under the asset-based lending (ABL) credit facility was approximately $530 million.  As of December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings on the ABL credit facility.  ATI has no significant debt maturities until 2025.During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company repurchased stock using the remaining $30 million of the $75 million repurchase plan approved by our Board of Directors in 2023.  In addition, on November 29, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $150 million of ATI stock.As of December 31, 2023, our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan is 114% funded on a financial reporting basis.  Our consolidated net pension liability, inclusive of obligations related to our qualified and nonqualifed defined benefit pension plans, was $9 million, or 97% funded on a financial reporting basis, a significant improvement compared to a $219 million liability, or 88% funded position, at December 31, 2022. Full Year 2023 ResultsFull YearY-O-Y($ in millions except per share amounts)20232022*ChangeSales$4,173.7$3,836.09 %Net income attributable to ATI$410.8$323.527 %Earnings per share$2.81$2.2326 %Non-GAAP information**Adjusted net income attributable to ATI**$373.4$351.26 %Adjusted earnings per share**$2.56$2.416 %ATI adjusted EBITDA**$634.6$612.84 % *Full year 2022 results reflect the change in accounting policy for recognizing actuarial gains and losses for the Company's defined benefit pension plans.  Additional details related to the policy change were furnished in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 19, 2024.** Detailed reconciliations of the reported information under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) to adjusted non-GAAP figures are included in accompanying financial tables. Full year results improved in 2023 as compared to 2022.  Adjusted results for 2023 exclude pre-tax special charges totaling $104.3 million.  However, the after-tax impact of the special items, including the deferred tax asset valuation allowance release, is a benefit of $37.4 million.  Pre-tax special charges primarily consist of pension related settlement and remeasurement losses, charges associated with the transformation of our European operations, and start-up costs.  Full year 2022 adjusted results excluded a loss on the sale of the Sheffield, UK operations and the costs associated with the settlement of litigation related to the 2016 idling of the Rowley, UT titanium sponge production facility.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited, dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"").  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods.  For example, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors because these measures are commonly used to analyze companies on the basis of operating performance, leverage and liquidity.  Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts to evaluate operating performance.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The

Despite shrinking by US$218m in the past week, ATI (NYSE:ATI) shareholders are still up 127% over 3 years`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/despite-shrinking-us-218m-past-190217057.html`2024-01-31 19:02:17`The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For instance the ATI Inc. (NYSE:ATI) share price is 127% higher than it was three years ago. How nice for those who held the stock! On top of that, the share price is up 11% in about a quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 16% in 90 days).Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 4.0%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. Check out our latest analysis for ATI While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, ATI moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).It is of course excellent to see how ATI has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.ATI shareholders gained a total return of 14% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 8% over half a decade It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for ATI   you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Essex Property (ESS) Q4 FFO & Revenues Beat, '24 View Issued`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/essex-property-ess-q4-ffo-170000925.html`2024-02-07 17:00:00`Essex Property Trust Inc. ESS reported fourth-quarter 2023 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $3.83, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.81. The figure also improved 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.Results reflect favorable growth in same-property revenues and net operating income (NOI). However, the same-property operating expenses partly acted as a dampener. ESS issued first-quarter and full-year 2024 guidance for core FFO per share.Total revenues of $421.7 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $419.7 million. Revenues were up 1.6% year over year.For the full-year 2023, the core FFO per share came in at $15.03, higher than the prior-year tally of $14.51, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. This was backed by 3.9% growth in revenues to $1.67 billion.In the fourth quarter, Essex Property’s same-property revenues increased 2.9% from the prior-year period, below our estimate of 3%. However, same-property operating expenses rose 4.5% year over year versus our estimate of 2.5%.Consequently, same-property NOI increased 2.3% year over year, below our estimate of 3.2%. Financial occupancies of 96.1% in the fourth quarter expanded 10 basis points (bps) year over year but fell 30 bps sequentially. The metric came below our estimate of 96.2%.Essex Property exited the fourth quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of $400.3 million, up from the $42.7 million recorded at the end of 2022.

Cashing in on the Fading American Dream with this REIT Hack`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cashing-fading-american-dream-reit-164150635.html`2024-02-07 16:41:50`"The quintessential American Dream, characterized by home ownership, stable jobs, and a white picket fence, is undergoing a profound transformation. Economic fluctuations, soaring real estate prices, and changing lifestyle preferences have made the traditional markers of success less attainable for many. However, within this shifting landscape lies a unique investment opportunity that not only acknowledges this changing dream but also capitalizes on it: AvalonBay Communities Inc. (NYSE:AVB).Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000. The surge in housing prices and the allure of urban living have led to a rental renaissance, where the freedom of renting is increasingly preferred over the burdens of home ownership. AvalonBay, with its extensive portfolio of high-quality apartment complexes, is at the forefront of this shift. The company’s properties offer a blend of convenience, amenities, and community, catering to the modern Americans desire for mobility and quality of life without the commitment of a mortgage.For investors, AvalonBay represents an opportunity to tap into the strong rental market. The company’s strategy of situating properties in high-demand urban and suburban regions ensures sustained demand and rental income stability. Furthermore, as a REIT, AvalonBay is required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders, providing a steady income stream through dividends, coupled with the potential for capital appreciation as the rental market continues to expand. Reflecting its strategic market position and confidence in its operational strategy, AvalonBay announced a quarterly dividend of $1.65 per share in the fourth quarter of 2023, leading to an annual payout rate of $4.95.Investing in AvalonBay and similar multifamily REITs offers a hedge against economic uncertainties. The rental market’s resilience, even in fluctuating economic conditions, underscores the long-term viability of this investment strategy. As the traditional American Dream continues to evolve, the demand for flexible, no-strings-attached living solutions is expected to rise, bolstering the growth prospects for multifamily REITs.AvalonBay’s commitment to sustainability and community engagement adds another layer of appeal to investors looking for socially responsible investment opportunities. The company’s efforts to enhance energy efficiency, reduce water usage, and foster community well-being align with the growing trend of ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investing. As the American Dream shifts from ownership to flexibility, investing in multifamily REITs like AvalonBay offers a way to benefit from this transformation. This investment avenue not only provides a pathway to participate in the real estate market without the direct challenges of property ownership but also aligns with the changing aspirations and realities of contemporary American life.Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000. Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

Ben?Ben Schall: Thank you, Jason. I am joined today by Kevin O’Shea, our CFO; Matt Birenbaum, our Chief Investment Officer and Sean Breslin, our Chief Operating Officer. We'd like to start by thanking our 3,000 AvalonBay Associates for delivering exceptional results in 2023. Your efforts and dedication are what make it happen, and your commitment to our purpose and culture makes us who we are as an organization. Thank you. As a brief recap on last year, as shown on Slide four, we achieved 8.6% core FFO growth for the year, a testament to our ability to grow earnings through unique internal and external drivers. Through the proactive management of our assets, same-store revenue ended the year up 6.3%, and NOI increased by 6.2%.For external growth, our developments underway continue to outperform with $575 million of completions across six projects, delivering outside stabilized yields of 7.1%. We're particularly proud of the results from our operating model transformation, where we are delivering enhanced value to customers and driving meaningful efficiencies. As highlighted on Slide five, our operating initiatives exceeded expectations in 2023, delivering $19 million of incremental annual NOI to the bottom line, which was $7 million or almost 60% higher than anticipated. Moving to Slide six and capital allocation, remain nimble in 2023, having shifted to being a net seller during the year, with four dispositions from our established regions for $445 million, $275 million of which we'd redeployed into acquisitions in our expansion regions.We also started $800 million of profitable new development during the year, including $300 million of starts in the fourth quarter at an initial projected yield of 6.7%. We also continue to build our structured investment business this year, in which we provide preferred equity or mezzanine loans to third parties for new multifamily construction. We're well positioned to underwrite this business given our development and construction expertise and our live proprietary data and we're fortunate to be building this book of business in today's environment, reflecting today's rates and asset values. The commitments we made in 2022 and 2023, which now total $192 million, are set to deliver an uplift in earnings this year and going forward. Our balance sheet is as strong as it has ever been, with a key metric summarized on Slide seven, providing strength as we manage the business and flexibility as we consider creative opportunities that may arise during 2024.Among a set of peers with strong balance sheets, we continue to experience some of the tightest credit spreads among all REITs, providing a meaningful financial advantage. Slide eight highlights our strategic focus areas for 2024. These focus areas draw upon our foundational strengths as an organization, while also recognizing our commitment to continue to evolve and our areas we are confident will drive superior growth over a multi-year period. Front and center are the next steps in our operating model transformation. At our Investor Day, we raised our target for incremental annual NOI to come from our operating initiatives to $80 million, $55 million of NOI from Horizon 1, and $25 million from Horizon 2. Second, we will continue to drive differentiated growth from our development and construction leadership.The near-term focus is on execution of our projects underway, ensuring they deliver outsized value for shareholders and while new start economics are challenging in certain of our markets, this is the type of environment in which we've typically found some of our most attractive development opportunities. Third, as a continued multi-year approach, we have set a target of shifting 80% of the portfolio to the suburbs from 70% today, and set a target of having 25% of our portfolio in our expansion regions, up meaningfully from 8% today and given the cooling of fundamentals in the Sunbelt, we believe we can make this transition at a more attractive basis than we were able to a couple of years ago. We're also making significant and very creative investments in the existing portfolio this year, ranging from apartment renovations to the creation of new Accessory Dwelling Units, or ADUs in certain markets.Finally, and as a follow-up to my comments about our balance sheet, we are confident that there will be opportunities for us to both utilize our balance sheet capacity and bring our strategic capabilities to bear, be it operational, development, or by utilizing our scale to generate value for shareholders. As we assess the year ahead and moving to Slide nine, our baseline expectation is for a slowing economic environment this year. As we have in the past, we start with consensus estimates from the National Association for Business Economics, or NABE, which forecasts positive but very modest job growth in 2024 of 55,000 jobs per month. This muted growth tempers housing demand, while other factors such as rent versus own economics should serve as a balanced apartment demand, particularly in our established regions, where it is now $2,500 per month more expensive to buy than to rent.Nevertheless, given mixed signals and what we believe is higher uncertainty in the economy and capital markets, our approach is to remain nimble and be ready to proactively adjust based on how 2024 evolves. In an environment of uncertainty, one known factor is new multifamily supply. In our established regions, we expect new apartment deliveries of 1.6% of existing stock in 2024, and expect this figure to further decline to 1.4% in 2025. Importantly, these figures are in line with historical averages for these coastal markets, and this is quite a contrast with supply dynamics in the Sunbelt, which will have twice the level of supply and this elevated supply dynamic in the Sunbelt is expected to continue at least through 2025, simply a function of the reality that it generally takes two plus years to complete and stabilize a new development project and so as we assess 2024, we expect to be relatively well positioned given the stable demand and limited supply outlook in our established regions, but are forecasting a slower year of growth.I'll now turn it to Kevin to provide an overview of our guidance for the year and the building blocks of earnings growth.Kevin O’Shea: Thanks, Ben. On Slide 11, we provide our operating and financial outlook for 2024. For the year, using the midpoint of guidance, we expect 1.4% growth in core FFO per share, driven by our same store portfolio and by stabilizing lease-up communities, partially offset by the impact of capital markets and transaction activity, as well as by slightly higher overhead costs. In our same-store residential portfolio, we expect revenue growth of 2.6% and NOI growth of 1.25% for the year and for our capital plan, we anticipate total capital uses of $1.4 billion in 2024, consisting of $1.1 billion in investment spend and $300 million in debt maturities. For our capital sources, we expect to benefit from nearly $400 million in projected free cash flow after dividends and to source $850 million in new capital, which we currently assume will be unsecured debt issued later this year.In this regard, thanks to our balance sheet strength and our A minus and A3 credit rating, we enjoy attractively priced debt today at around 5% on a 10-year unsecured debt that we can invest in development yielding in the mid-sixth range to support future earnings growth. We also project drawing upon $175 million or the $400 million in unrestricted cash on hand at yearend 2023, resulting in projected unrestricted cash at the end of this year of about $225 million. On Slide 12, we illustrate the components of our expected 1.4% growth in core FFO per share. We expect $0.15 per share of earnings growth to come from NOI growth in our same-store sources of growth with a $0.29 impact from capital markets in transaction activities. And with that summary of our outlook, I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss our operating business.Sean Breslin: All right, thanks, Kevin. Turning to Slide 13, three primary drivers will support same-store revenue growth in 2024. First, embedded rent roll growth of 1%, down approximately 50 basis points from where it was at the end of Q3 2023, which is consistent with historical trends, plus incremental lease rate growth throughout the year. Second, an outsized contribution of roughly 80 basis points from the projected 13% increase in other rental revenue, which is derived from our operating initiatives and third, about a 60 basis point improvement in underlying bad debt from residents from 2.4% in 2023 to an expected 1.8% in 2024. The cumulative growth from those three primary drivers is expected to be partially offset by a 30 basis point headwind from the projected $6 million year-over-year reduction of rent relief and a modest drag from net concessions and economic occupancy.To provide a little more detail on underlying bad debt trends from residents, we're expecting a 60 basis point improvement year-over-year, our forecast reflects an underlying bad debt rate of roughly 1.6% at year-end 2024, which is still more than double our historical pre-COVID rate. Moving to Slide 14, we expect revenue growth in our established regions to be more than double that of our expansion regions, which is primarily a function of the substantially lower level of new supply in the established regions and within our established regions, we expect better demand supply fundamentals on the East Coast as compared to the West Coast. Southern California is expected to produce the strongest same-store revenue growth, which is primarily the result of a substantial improvement in underlying bad debt on a year-over-year basis.Transitioning to Slide 15 to address our operating model transformation, we're tremendously proud of our team's focus and efforts over the last couple years, which have produced approximately $27 million in incremental NOI. We expect to recognize another roughly $9 million benefit in our consolidated portfolio during 2024. The key drivers in 2024 include Avalon Connect, our bulk Internet and managed Wi-Fi deployments, along with smart access features. In addition, we expect an incremental benefit from our shift to a new organizational model, which reflects neighborhood staffing supported by centralized teams. While we have specific plans for 2024, our focus in these areas and others will continue to deliver additional value for associates, residents and shareholders for years to come.Turning to Slide 16 to address our same-store operating expense outlook, we expect roughly 340 basis points of organic expense growth, another approximately 140 basis points from profitable operating initiatives, and roughly 75 basis points from the expiration of various tax abatement programs in the portfolio, primarily in New York City. As it relates to our initiatives, the 140 basis point increase is driven by 170 basis points from our Avalon Connect offering, which I mentioned earlier, partially offset by reductions in payroll. As I've noted in the past, the deployment of our Avalon Connect offering, which will ultimately enhance portfolio NOI by more than $30 million, will pressure expense growth during the deployment period. We expect to be fully deployed by the end of 2024, so the operating expense impact will diminish materially as we move into 2025.So now I'll turn it over to Matt to address our capital allocation activity. Matt?Matt Birenbaum: All right, great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to Slide 17, we're planning another year of accretive activity across all of our various investment platforms in 2024. We expect to break ground on seven new developments, representing $870 million of investment at a weighted average yield in the mid-6% range, grow our SIP business by another $75 million with rates on new originations in excess of 12% and expand our investments in our existing portfolio that we discussed a bit at our Investor Day, where we see opportunity to further increase our activity to roughly $100 million at yields of roughly 10%. In the investment sales market, activity levels are still low, but most market participants do expect a gradual increase in transactions as the year progresses.Our plan is to access this market as part of our portfolio management strategy, selling assets in our established regions and redeploying that capital into acquisitions in our expansion regions. We expect this activity to be roughly neutral on both a volume and return basis, buying and selling in equal amounts and at equivalent yields. As Ben mentioned, the dynamics of this trading activity look to be more favorable in '24 than they might have been in the recent past, as some short-term operating challenges in our targeted expansion regions may present the opportunity to acquire assets significantly below replacement cost. Of course, the market for all of our investment activities is highly dynamic, and we are prepared to pivot and adjust our plan in response to potential changes in the macro environment as the year evolves.Turning to our existing development underway, Slide 18 details the impressive results that continue to be generated by our current lease-ups. The four development communities that had active leasing in Q4 are delivering rents $260 per month, or 8.4% above our initial underwriting, which is translating into a 20-basis point increase in yield. As a reminder, in general, the rents we quote on our developments are current market rents as of the time we break ground, and we do not trend or update these rents until we achieve significant actual leasing velocity close to completion of the project. While market rents certainly didn't grow as much in 2023 as in prior years, there is still some lift to come when we mark the rents to market on the $855 million of lease-ups we expect to open throughout the course of 2024.We estimate this increase at roughly 5% based on where market rents are today at these specific communities, which would provide those deals with about 30 basis points of increased yield as well. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben to wrap things up. Ben Schall Thanks, Matt. Slide 19 provides our key takeaways. We were very pleased with our execution in 2023 and expect to continue to be relatively well-positioned in a year of slower growth in 2024. We will continue to evolve and execute against our strategic focus areas, including harvesting tangible benefits from the investments we are making in the transformation of our operating model and on the capital front, we will remain nimble, adjusting to the environment as it unfolds, while also being on the lookout and ready to take advantage of accretive opportunities that may present themselves this year, opportunities where we can utilize our leading balance sheet and draw upon our unique strategic capabilities.With that, I'll turn it to the operator to open the line for questions.Operator: Thank you.

AvalonBay, a prominent real estate investment trust (REIT), owns and manages a portfolio of 299 apartment communities with over 90,000 units, focusing on high-quality properties in major metropolitan areas across the United States.AvalonBay's financial performance in 2023 showcased resilience in its core FFO, which is a critical measure of a REIT's operating performance. The increase in core FFO reflects the company's ability to generate stable and growing funds from its operations, which is essential for maintaining and increasing dividend payouts to shareholders. However, the decrease in EPS, particularly for the full year, suggests that the company faced challenges that impacted its net income, such as higher operating expenses and non-core items.The company's Same Store Residential rental revenue increased by 4.5% in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, driven by a 3.4% increase in lease rates.

With 37% ownership in AvePoint, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVPT), insiders continue to have the largest holding even though they have sold shares recently`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/37-ownership-avepoint-inc-nasdaq-125101803.html`2024-01-15 12:51:01`AvePoint's significant insider ownership suggests inherent interests in company's expansionA total of 6 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Insiders have been selling lately A look at the shareholders of AvePoint, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVPT) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 37% stake, individual insiders possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Despite recent sales, insiders own the most shares in the company.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about AvePoint. View our latest analysis for AvePoint Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.AvePoint already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see AvePoint's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in AvePoint. Zhijian Lu is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 9.1% by the third-largest shareholder. Xunkai Gong, who is the second-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Top Key Executive. Additionally, the company's CEO Tianyi Jiang directly holds 8.6% of the total shares outstanding.On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 6 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.It seems insiders own a significant proportion of AvePoint, Inc.. Insiders own US$556m worth of shares in the US$1.5b company. That's quite meaningful. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.With a stake of 9.1%, private equity firms could influence the AvePoint board. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand AvePoint better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for AvePoint   you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) Annual Results Just Came Out: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting For This Year`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avery-dennison-corporation-nyse-avy-142650062.html`2024-02-03 14:26:50`Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) last week reported its latest yearly results, which makes it a good time for investors to dive in and see if the business is performing in line with expectations. It looks like the results were a bit of a negative overall. While revenues of US$8.4b were in line with analyst predictions, statutory earnings were less than expected, missing estimates by 4.4% to hit US$6.20 per share. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. Check out our latest analysis for Avery Dennison Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Avery Dennison's eleven analysts is for revenues of US$8.78b in 2024. This would reflect a satisfactory 4.9% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to soar 44% to US$9.01. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$8.86b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.14 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$218, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Avery Dennison, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$248 and the most bearish at US$154 per share. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Avery Dennison'shistorical trends, as the 4.9% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 5.7% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 2.9% annually. So although Avery Dennison is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Avery Dennison. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Avery Dennison analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Avery Dennison  you should be aware of.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

In the fourth quarter, we again delivered sequential earnings growth, with earnings up significantly compared to prior year and in line with our expectations. We grew volume sequentially and compared to prior year in both segments, significantly expanded margins, generated strong free cash flow and delivered significant growth in Intelligent Labels. Looking at the full year, while market conditions in 2023 turned out to be very different than we anticipated, and we did not deliver on our initial expectations for the full year. I am pleased with how we navigated the challenging environment. We protected margins as the industries we serve experienced significant destocking, improved service for our customers, deepened our insights on the drivers of demand and inventory throughout the value chain, continue to shift our portfolio towards high-value categories as we delivered on our growth opportunities, particularly in Intelligent Labels and generated strong free cash flow, highlighting the strength and resilience of our overall franchise.During this period, we leveraged our core strengths of productivity, cost management and capital stewardship and increased our potential in Intelligent Label solutions to minimize the impact of the low volume environment on our bottom line. More broadly, we see the reduction of excess inventory throughout the value chain as a good thing. As it positions our industries and business to return to a more normalized growth trajectory in 2024 and demonstrate the growth power of our Intelligent Labels platform in particular. Importantly, the macro uncertainty and volume impacts in 2023 have seen customers increasingly looking for help to solve some of the most complex industry challenges, such as labor efficiency and supply chain effectiveness, waste reduction, circularity and transparency and helping better connect brands and their consumers.It is clear physical items will need a digital identity to solve these challenges and customers are increasingly turning to Avery Dennison as the leader to help them better connect the physical and digital worlds. Looking forward, a more cautious outlook is prudent particularly in the near term as economic indicators are still mixed and geopolitical risks remain elevated. That said, I'm confident that 2024 will be a year of strong earnings growth. Inventory destocking in our label business is largely complete. Apparel volumes will likely recover in the second half, and we expect significant growth in our high-value solutions, in particular our Intelligent Labels platform as adoption accelerates across new categories and apparel rebounds. Now a brief summary of the year by segment.Materials group delivered strong margins and volume improved sequentially each quarter as inventory destocking continued to moderate throughout the year. As you can see on Slide 6, label volume in North America and Europe where inventory destocking was most prevalent, continued to improve at a steady pace throughout the year. As I previously indicated, we believe inventory destocking is complete in Europe and now largely complete in North America. In the fourth quarter, volume was better than we had anticipated in Europe and slightly lower than we had anticipated in North America. And demand in these regions continues to be mixed on broad macro uncertainty and slow consumption of goods. As inventory destocking concludes, we expect volume will again improve sequentially in the first quarter, a trend we have seen thus far in January.Overall, emerging market label volume was up low single digits for the year with increased momentum in the back half, particularly in India and China. Solutions group sales were up low single digits for the year, up high single digits in the second half as strong growth in high-value solutions and the impact of acquisitions more than offset a decline in base solutions. Volume and margin continued to improve throughout the year, particularly in the back half of the year as new programs in intelligent labels ramped, apparel destocking began to moderate. While apparel imports continue to be down significantly both compared to prior year in 2019, the trend in North America started to show signs of improvement in Q4, which can be seen on Slide 6.Following a relatively mixed holiday season, retailers and brands continue to factor muted sentiment into their near-term sourcing plans. We anticipate this combined with the Suez and Panama Canal shipping issues will likely see apparel industry volumes normalize mid-2024. As you can see on Slide 7, enterprise-wide intelligent labels grew low double digits in 2023, reaching roughly $850 million in revenue, including currency translation. Non-apparel categories, including logistics and food continue to ramp significantly throughout the year and were up roughly 75% for the year. In logistics, the team successfully executed the largest RFID program single wave rollout in the industry's history, making greater shipping accuracy for our customer possible.Our execution in these key rollouts in new categories is delivering significant value for our customers and compelling proof points for broader segment adoption. This growth was partially offset by a decline in apparel as retailers and brands reduced inventories throughout the year. As we continue to see adoption in categories like logistics, food and general retail as well as a rebound in apparel, we are targeting to deliver 20% or more growth in our Intelligent Labels platform in 2024, further advancing our leadership position at the intersection of the physical and digital. As I indicated, our ability to help address industry challenges, such as labor efficiency, waste, transparency and consumer connection in very large volume categories like logistics and food is increasingly resonating with customers.We continue to invest to capture the significant opportunity ahead as we grow the size of the overall industry. We continue to refine our strategies raising the bar for ourselves in the process to ensure we continue to deliver superior value creation for all of our stakeholders. The ability of our teams to drive these strategies over the long haul, while adapting to an ongoing dynamic environment has been exceptional. As you can see on Slide 10, our focus over the long-term is the success of all of our stakeholders. As such, we're making solid progress towards our long-term sustainability goals and Greg will shortly walk through our progress against our long-term financial objectives. Stepping back, the underlying fundamentals of our business are strong.We're exposed to diverse and growing markets with clear catalysts for long-term growth. We are industry leaders in our primary businesses with clear competitive advantages in scale and innovation. We have a clear set of strategies that have been key to our success over the long-term across a wide range of business cycles and we are uniquely positioned to connect the physical and digital to help address some of the most complex problems in the industries we serve. We remain confident that our strategies, along with our team's ability to execute in any environment will enable us to continue to generate superior value creation through a balance of GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns over the long-term, including delivering strong earnings growth in 2024 as we continue to unlock our significant growth opportunities and our core businesses rebound.I want to thank our entire team for their continued resilience focus on excellence and commitment to addressing the unique challenges at hand. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Greg.Greg Lovins: Thanks, Deon. Hello, everybody. I'll first provide some additional color on our fourth quarter results and our performance against our long-term targets, then walk you through our 2024 outlook. In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.16, in line with our expectations, up sequentially and up 31% compared to prior year, driven by benefits from higher volume and productivity. Compared to prior year, sales were up 3% ex-currency and 1% on an organic basis. As higher volume was partially offset by deflation related price reductions. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 16% in the quarter, up 3 points compared to prior year, with adjusted EBITDA dollars up 29% compared to prior year and also up sequentially.We generated strong adjusted free cash flow of $218 million in the fourth quarter and nearly $600 million for the full year. With our working capital metrics on target to end the year, resulting in more than 100% adjusted free cash flow conversion. We invested $285 million in fixed capital and information technology in the year, paring back investments in our base given the lower volume environment while continuing to invest in our high-value categories, particularly Intelligent Labels. And our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at year-end of 2.4%. We're continuing to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including strategic acquisitions and continuing to return cash to shareholders. In 2023, we returned nearly $400 million to shareholders through a combination of our growing dividend and share repurchases, and we deployed roughly $225 million for M&A.Turning to segment results for the fourth quarter. Materials group sales were down 4% ex currency and on an organic basis, driven by low single-digit volume growth, which was more than offset by deflation related price reductions and product mix. Inventory destocking downstream from us continued to moderate. As you can see on Slide 6, label volume in North America and Europe combined, continued to improve, particularly in Europe. Volume also continues to improve through the first four weeks of this year. Looking at label materials, organic volume trends versus prior year in the quarter North America was down slightly more than we anticipated. Given destocking in the fourth quarter at our customers and with retailers and brands managing their year-end working capital.We believe inventory destocking in North America is now largely complete. Europe was up high single digits as we began to lap the destocking, which started midway through the fourth quarter in 2022. Asia Pacific was up low single digits and Latin America was up low teens following a softer Q3 and up mid-single digits for the second half. Also compared to prior year, graphics and reflective sales were up mid-single digits organically, performance tapes in medical were down low to mid-single digits. Materials group delivered a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.2% in the fourth quarter, up 340 basis points compared to prior year driven by benefits from productivity and the net impact of pricing and raw material input costs. GAAP operating margin was 12% in the quarter, which included an impact from the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso in the latter part of the year.This impact was adjusted out of our non-GAAP financials. Regarding raw material costs, we saw low single-digit deflation sequentially in the fourth quarter and expect just modest deflation sequentially in the first quarter. As I mentioned in the last couple of quarters, following a period of significant inflation, these lower costs are largely being passed along in price reductions to our customers. Shifting now to Solutions Group. Sales were up 19% ex-currency and 14% on an organic basis, with high-value solutions up more than 20% and base solutions up mid-single digits. Base apparel solutions were up sequentially and roughly comparable to prior year. Intelligent label sales grew more than 30% in the quarter. Non-apparel categories, particularly logistics and food grew significantly, up roughly 110%, as new programs continue to roll out with apparel categories comparable to prior year.Adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.2% was up 180 basis points sequentially and up 230 basis points compared to prior year, driven primarily by higher volume. Now shifting to our long-term performance. Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials provides an update on our progress against the long-term financial targets that we communicated in 2021. And recall that this represents our fourth set of long-term goals after meeting or beating our previous three sets. The consistent execution of our key strategies enables us to continue delivering against our targets with an overriding focus on delivering GDP-plus growth and top quartile return on capital over the long-term. Through the first 3 years of the cycle, sales growth on a constant currency basis was 8% annually, above our target in GDP, driven by higher prices and volume.We expect strong volume growth in 2024 with some deflation-related price reductions as previously noted. Compared to 2020, adjusted EBITDA dollars have grown roughly 7.5% annually excluding currency translation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.1% in 2023 with the second half of the year at 16%. Looking forward, our guidance for 2024 would indicate a roughly 9% EBITDA CAGR by the end of this year, excluding currency translation. Adjusted EPS grew roughly 5.5% annually over the past 3 years, excluding currency translation, short of our target of 10%, due primarily to the inventory destocking in 2023. With strong earnings growth expected this year, we anticipate making progress against this target in 2024. And as always, our focus will continue to be the optimal balance of growth, margins and capital efficiency to drive incremental EVA over the long-term.Our return on total capital was 12% in 2023 including higher costs in the year for restructuring charges, legal fees and the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation. We expect our ROTC will be back up in the mid- to high teens in 2024. Given the diversity of our end markets, our strong competitive advantages and resilience as an organization to adjust course when needed, we're confident in our ability to make strong progress against these targets in 2024. Now shifting to our outlook for 2024. In the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be roughly similar to the fourth quarter of 2023. With continued underlying sequential improvement at least partially offset by the seasonality of solutions in both apparel and logistics and the return of some of the temporary cost measures we took in 2023 with incentive compensation as an example.As 2024 progresses, we expect our earnings will improve sequentially, driven by the normalization of label volume earlier in the year, the normalization of apparel volume mid-year Significant growth in intelligent labels as apparel rebounds and new programs rollout and ongoing productivity actions. For 2024, overall, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9 to $9.50, up 17% at the midpoint. We've outlined the full year contributing factors on Slide 18 of our supplemental presentation materials. To highlight key drivers of the midpoint of our guidance compared to prior year, we anticipate roughly 3.5% organic sales growth with high single-digit volume growth, partially offset by deflation related price reductions. We estimate overall productivity, including restructuring savings, will offset higher employee costs including wage and benefit increases and higher incentive compensation following lower payouts for 2023.We expect to make selective strategic growth investments, particularly in high-value solutions and we estimate net non-operational items, tax, interest, currency and share count to be roughly neutral. In summary, we continue to improve our results as we advance our growth initiatives and our markets normalize. We expect a strong rebound in 2024 through a variety of environments and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver exceptional value through our strategies for long-term profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation.

'You can't produce a baby in 1 month by getting nine women pregnant': Warren Buffett's take on successful investing rings truer than ever as S&P 500 crosses 5000. 3 stocks for the long haul`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cant-produce-baby-1-month-100000185.html`2024-02-10 11:00:00`"Investor optimism was on full display this week as the S&P 500 hit yet another milestone. The benchmark index briefly surpassed the 5,000 level during intraday trading on Thursday.Widely considered a proxy of the U.S. stock market, the S&P 500 is up over 5% so far this year after gaining 24% in 2023. Of course, this followed a nearly 20% plunge in 2022, its worst annual performance since 2008.Commercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years.

Try these 5 easy money hacks to help you make and save thousands of dollars in the new year (they will only take seconds)Those who stayed invested despite the screaming headlines, economic uncertainty and volatility have been rewarded with big returns.Adopting a long-term mindset is something legendary value investor Warren Buffett advocates as well. The 93-year-old, who bought his first stock at 11 and is now worth over $130 billion, espouses the buy-and-hold approach. He recommends investing in good companies, having patience and avoiding panic selling when the market is choppy.In the 1985 shareholder letter for his company, Berkshire Hathaway, he wrote, ""No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: you can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.""This good — and extremely colorful — statement (and he has made many) was in reference to Capital Cities' $3.5 billion purchase of the much larger ABC in 1985, which Berkshire helped to finance in exchange for a stake. Buffett wrote, ""For Cap Cities, ABC is a major undertaking whose economics are likely to be unexciting over the next few years. This bothers us not an iota; we can be very patient.""Ten years later, the combined company was sold to Walt Disney for $19 billion.With that in mind, here are three stocks you might want to consider adding to your watch list.The Kraft Heinz corporation is only eight years old, but the two brands that constitute it have each been around for more than a century.

Both brands have steadily grown their footprints across the world over the intervening decades.In some parts of the world, these brands are synonymous with cheese, ketchup and macaroni. Brand recognition like this takes forever to build, which is why the combined business has so much underlying value.Today, the company is worth more than $44 billion, and the stock trades at about 15 times earnings — reasonable for a low-growth consumer brand.Berkshire first acquired a stake in Heinz in 2013. Two years later, the firm put up $5 billion as part of the mega-merger that brought the two household brands together. The combined company is currently the seventh largest Berkshire holding.Read more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord.

It’s the fourth-largest position in his portfolio, which is a testament to his long-term commitment to this brand.

The company's ability to design attractive card products and payment solutions has been instrumental in acquiring and retaining customers, particularly among the Millennial and Gen Z demographics.Competitive Pressure in the Premium Card Segment: Despite its strong brand, American Express Co faces intense competition in the premium card space. Competitors are aggressively targeting high-spending customers and key business partners with compelling value propositions, which could erode American Express's market share. The company must continuously innovate and enhance its offerings to maintain its position in this highly contested segment.Regulatory Challenges and Compliance Costs: As a global financial institution, American Express Co is subject to stringent regulatory scrutiny across multiple jurisdictions.

Institutional investors are American Express Company's (NYSE:AXP) biggest bettors and were rewarded after last week's US$5.8b market cap gain`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-american-express-companys-110013005.html`2024-02-09 11:00:13`Significantly high institutional ownership implies American Express' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 12 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Recent sales by insiders If you want to know who really controls American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 65% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$151b in market cap. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 19%.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of American Express. See our latest analysis for American Express Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in American Express. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see American Express' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. American Express is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 21% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.5% and 6.1% of the stock.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 12 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of American Express Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$223m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public companies currently own 21% of American Express stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - American Express has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Capital Investments At AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) Point To A Promising Future`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/capital-investments-autozone-nyse-azo-130019265.html`2024-02-08 13:00:19`What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at AutoZone (NYSE:AZO), we liked what we saw.Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on AutoZone is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.48 = US$3.6b ÷ (US$16b - US$8.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2023).Thus, AutoZone has an ROCE of 48%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for AutoZone In the above chart we have measured AutoZone's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering AutoZone here  for free.AutoZone deserves to be commended in regards to it's returns. The company has consistently earned 48% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 72% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.On a side note, AutoZone's current liabilities are still rather high at 54% of total assets. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.In the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 219% return they've received over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.If you'd like to know more about AutoZone, we've spotted   4 warning signs,  and 2 of them are a bit unpleasant.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date.

Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $9.80 a share, just one day from its upcoming earnings release on February 6, 2024.By taking the percentage difference between the $9.80 Most Accurate Estimate and the $9.73 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Chipotle Mexican Grill has an Earnings ESP of 0.76%.CMG is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure.

13 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-aerospace-defense-stocks-113953867.html`2024-02-10 11:39:53`In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best aerospace and defense stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the high technology aerospace and defense industry and how it's shaped the modern day world, you can take a look at the 5 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In. If there's one thing that can be said with certainty, it's that the defense and aerospace industry is one of the most important in the world when it comes to shaping power politics. Global geopolitics, and as the late Henry Kissinger would describe, 'realpolitik' is based on the cold, hard reality of military superiority. Traditionally, this superiority came in the form of strength in numbers - a concept that still holds true today.However, along with this, another concept that has borne the test of time is the use of technology for warfare. Whether it's the Mongols who relied on brutal cavalry tactics, or the Ottoman use of gunpowder that made it a 'gunpowder empire', technology has shaped warfare and global power dynamics.These days, the dominant and only superpower (some would even say a hyperpower) is the United States of America. The U.S., if you're unaware, has the most powerful military in the world, fueled by the greatest number of aircraft carriers for any military and an air force whose aircraft number in the thousands. Safe to say, aerospace plays a crucial role in maintaining American global military superiority, and by effect, it also shapes the global world order.Powering the U.S. military behemoth, which also has the biggest defense budget in the world, are aerospace and defense stocks. These stocks are firms that either directly engage in providing the U.S. military, through the Department of Defense, with their combat or combat support equipment, or those that provide essential and tertiary capabilities such as the defense stock Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL) and Maxar Technologies whose advanced satellites carry the ability to remotely image any site in the world and provide military planners with invaluable information to inform their tactical and strategic decisions.Technology sits at the heart of competing when it comes to defense and aerospace stocks, and a technological edge is precisely the reason that the U.S. is at the top of the global power food chain. American jets are envied by dictators and monarchs all over the world, and no matter what their public statements against the U.S. are, it wouldn't be imprudent to assume that they would give an arm and a leg (and then some) to get a taste of what American defense and aerospace stocks have to offer.So what exactly do they offer? Well, let's start with one of the most well known defense and aerospace stocks in the world, the Bethesda, Maryland based aerospace firm Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Lockheed, if you're unaware, makes and sells fighter aircraft. While it also has other divisions, such as a space segment that aims to develop a colony on the Moon complete with a nuclear reactor in partnership with the National Aerospace and Space Administration (NASA), Lockheed Martin's bread and butter are airplanes. The firm in its current form came into being in the late 1990s as the U.S. defense industry consolidated (more on that later). Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995, after it acquired General Dynamics - perhaps one of the most consequential defense and aerospace stocks in the world.That's a tall claim. So what made Martin Marietta so special? Well, the firm bought General Dynamics in 1993 -  a deal that also saw it acquire the rights to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The F-16 is the most successful fighter aircraft in the world and is used by most of the world's leading air forces. Its success has defined modern day dog fighting - an art that bulky fighter jets such as the The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s F-15 struggled with.Lockheed has moved past dog fighting since then. For aerospace and defense stocks, the 21st century has been all about stealth. Lockheed's F-117 'Nighthawk' and the technologies used on it dominated the stealth debate for decades, and led to the development of the world's only operational fifth generation fighter aircraft, the F-22 'Raptor'. America's crown jewel, the Raptor is an air superiority fighter designed with the singular aim of ensuring that enemy fighters cannot contest the United States Air Force's control of an airspace.So, as aerospace and defense stocks continue to make magic a reality, we decided to take a look at some top stocks. Among these, the notable ones are The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).Andrey Khachatryan/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To make our list of the best aerospace and defense stocks, we ranked the 40 most valuable aerospace and defense stocks that trade in U.S. markets by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q3 2023.

15 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-countries-most-military-manpower-080712093.html`2024-02-10 08:07:12`"In this article, we list and discuss the 15 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World.According to the World Bank’s report, a total amount of $2.21 trillion was spent on military expenses worldwide in 2022. However, this comes as no surprise as countries tend to spend a significant portion of their GDP on their military to strengthen defenses and stay competitive in the world, every year. At the same time, there are also some countries with no army, navy, or air force (See: 15 Countries that have no Army, Navy, or Air Force) but continue to thrive, thanks to the agreements they have with strong countries like the US, France, and Australia to protect them against attacks of any sort. Note that the US, France, and Australia are considered “strong countries” because they have strong economies and powerful militaries (See: 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023) to serve and protect the citizens.As of 2024, the United States is the strongest military in the world, followed by China, Russia and India. But are they also the strongest when it comes to reserve military manpower? Reserve military are soldiers who have serve some years in the military and then join the Army Reserves or National Guard. Reservists get military perks as they are part of the military without devoting themselves full-time to the military. Military benefits from reserve manpower in times of emergencies as they can call reservists anytime to duty when the country is in need. Some countries are facing a decline in their active and reserve manpower despite having a high-end military. For instance, according to Pew Research, 18% of the US population was serving in the military in 1980, but the percentage dropped to 6% in 2022. They've also forecasted that although around 18.3 million veterans in the US, the numbers will decline to 12.1 million in the next 25 years — by 2048. The gradual fall in military manpower is an area of concern for the United States. But still, for now, it is the number one miliary in the world. In 2022, the US spent $877 billion on its military, which was 3.5% of its total GDP. Military spending by governments surges during wars and conflicts, and companies that manufacture and supply arms and ammunition achieve the most profitable outcomes. During the Ukraine-Russia war, the US’s big five defense contractors made huge profits in 2022 from selling weapons to Ukraine. According to Reuters, the big five MIC companies in defense industry, Boeing (NYSE: BA), General Dynamics (NYSE: GD), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC), and RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX) earned $157.5 billion in fiscal year 2023, an increase from $153.6 billion in fiscal year 2022. Moreover, in 2023, the sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments rose by 16% to a record $238 billion. As the Russia-Ukraine war is ongoing, the defense industry will continue to rise, and the MIC of the United States will continue to make profits. As reported by Global Times, War is ""good for business,"" a recruiter for BlackRock Inc (NYSE: BLK) told the O'Keefe Media Group. As of February 9, 2024, Australia pledged an additional AUD 400 million to Boeing (NYSE: BA)'s indigenous Ghost Bat autonomous drone program. The government previously signed an AUD 600 million contract with Boeing (NYSE: BA) to sustain and upgrade F/A-18F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler fleets for the Royal Australian Air Force. Similarly, in December 2023, Ordnance and Tactical Systems, a business unit of General Dynamics (NYSE: GD), was awarded a $654.5 million contract by the Army Contracting Command of Newark, NJ for the metal parts program for M1128. General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) was selected alongside IMT Defense for this contract, and both companies will be competing for each order of the contract.On the other hand, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), a US weapons manufacturer, signed contracts with some leading Saudi companies at the World Defense Show in Riyadh on 5 February 2024. The company awarded Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) subcontracts to a pair of Saudi Arabian firms, Middle East Propulsion Company (MEPC) and Arabian International Company (AIC), for locally manufacturing parts of Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) missile system.As geopolitical changes and conflicts are occurring more often than before, countries heavily depend on their military, including the army, navy, and air force, to defend the country in crucial times. In the list below, we discuss the top countries with the most reserve military manpower in the world.Glynnis Jones / ShutterstockCountries with the most reserve military manpower in the world are listed in ascending order of the size of their reserve force.

As of 2024, the total number of reserve military manpower in the country is 600,000.

As of 2024, Finland has a reserve military manpower of 870,000 which has several FDF responsibilities like domestic security duties, looking after international peacekeeping operations, etc. In Finland, every male citizen is part of the reserve until he turns 60 years of age.

Gol Accuses Latam Airlines of Attempting to Poach Pilots, Aircraft`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gol-accuses-latam-airlines-attempting-201716440.html`2024-02-09 21:35:43`(Bloomberg) -- Bankrupt Brazilian airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA accused its rival Latam Airlines Group SA of taking advantage of its recent financial trouble by trying to poach its pilots and Boeing aircraft.Most Read from BloombergGermany’s Days as an Industrial Superpower Are Coming to an EndBiden’s Attempt to Address Memory Issue Backfires With New GaffeTop Nigerian Banker Killed in Helicopter Crash in CaliforniaBezos Sells $2 Billion of Amazon Shares in First Major Stock Sale Since 2021Putin Showed Carlson Why He Really Invaded UkraineThe Sao Paulo-based airline said in court papers filed Thursday that Latam recently sent a letter to Gol’s business partners inquiring about leasing Boeing aircraft and solicited Brazilian pilots experienced in flying such aircraft in an Internet job posting. Latam has historically flown a fleet of Airbus aircraft and the Boeing models its competitor inquired about are a specific type of narrow body aircraft Gol flies, the filing said.The Brazilian airline said Latam inquired about procuring Boeing 737 aircraft the day after Gol filed Chapter 11 on Jan. 25, while its rival “is at its most vulnerable.” Gol asked Judge Martin Glenn, who is overseeing the bankruptcy, for permission to issue a subpoena for documents from Latam as it investigates the scope of the alleged solicitations.“Given the recent events in the industry, we thought you may be interested in learning that LATAM group continues to seek aircraft,” Latam allegedly said in a letter sent to its business partners on Jan. 26. The letter, a copy of which is included in Thursday’s court filing, goes on to say that Latam’s Brazilian affiliate is seeking to increase its flights in the country and region.Gol said it believes Latam is trying to interfere with its business and that its rival may have violated the Brazilian airline’s automatic bankruptcy stay which protects companies in Chapter 11.Latam has denied Gol’s allegations.Latam said Friday the company is in the market for so-called narrow body aircraft because there are supply chain problems impacting the availability of Airbus and Boeing aircraft. The company said it does fly some Boeing aircraft and flew Boeing 737 aircraft up until 2014. Even though Gol exclusively uses Boeing 737 aircraft, Latam said, “the Debtors operate just a fraction of the overall market for these incredibly popular planes.”In emails with Gol’s attorneys included in Thursday’s filing, Latam lawyer Brian Shaughnessy said “GOL’s accusations against LATAM are completely wrong and, frankly, frivolous, as well as inconsistent with well-established jurisprudence.” In a Feb. 6 email to Gol’s lawyers, Shaughnessy wrote “From our perspective, it is GOL who is trying to interfere with LATAM’s business.”Gol has already won approval from Judge Glenn to start drawing on a $950 million Chapter 11 loan provided by lenders including Elliott Investment Management LP. The airline is one of the largest in South America but has struggled with financial liabilities it incurred by the drop in travel during the pandemic, substantial debt and Brazil’s high interest rates.The case is GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, 24-10118, US Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).(Updates to include details on Latam’s Friday court filing)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekOpenAI’s Secret Weapon Is Sam Altman’s 33-Year-Old LieutenantHow Jack Dorsey’s Plan to Get Elon Musk to Save Twitter Went SouthIt’s Time to Talk About Those Taylor Swift Super Bowl BetsInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went WrongA Tiny Fund Takes a Big Short on Corporate Debt Maturity Wall©2024 Bloomberg L.P.Related Quotes`['GOLLQ', 'LTMAY', 'BA']`

The CEO of Europe’s largest airline is about to trigger a $108 million bonus that British shareholders can’t vote on because of Brexit`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-europe-largest-airline-trigger-195711304.html`2024-02-09 19:57:11`Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary could be in for a €100 million ($108 million) payday if the airline’s stock continues on its current trajectory.The Dublin-based carrier’s shares currently sit at €20.11 each. Should the stock reach €21 and stay there for 28 consecutive days, O’Leary would be eligible for stock options valued at €100 million ($108 million). But that has some analysts from Barclays worried—and British shareholders won’t even get a say on the pay package for the leader of Europe’s largest airline.As with most major bonus payouts to executives, shareholders get the opportunity to vote on whether to approve the payment. However, because of financial regulations imposed since Brexit, shareholders in the U.K. won’t get the chance to do so. Barclays analysts said the fact that not all shareholders will get to vote on the pay package presents a corporate governance risk.O’Leary already owns about 3.9% of the company, a stake valued at around $978 million.Ryanair and Barclays did not respond to requests for comment.O’Leary himself, for what it’s worth, has been a staunch critic of Brexit. As far back as 2018, O’Leary warned that complying with the EU’s laws overseeing airlines would be extremely difficult and that he could see flights between the U.K. and the continent grounded. When the U.K.’s economy struggled in late 2022 he blamed it on Brexit, which he called a “car crash.” In his usual colorful style O’Leary opined that the U.K. would eventually rejoin the EU once all the “delusional” Brexiteers died.As a result of Brexit, Ryanair implemented a new corporate policy in December 2020 that would restrict U.K. shareholders from voting on corporate matters. The rules were adopted to comply with EU regulations that require airlines from countries within the bloc be majority owned by EU nationals. U.K. shareholders had their existing shares turned into restricted shares that didn’t allow them to vote on governance issues. U.K. nationals were then banned from buying stock in the company, though they are allowed to purchase a different class of shares called American depositary receipts that are available on the Nasdaq. In 2021, when some U.K. investors violated those regulations, Ryanair forced them to sell their shares via an independent broker.That, in addition to the fact that executives have signaled they are open to using a portion of the company’s available cash for stock buybacks, raises governance concerns, according to Barclays analysts.“This would add further corporate governance complexity,” wrote Andrew Lobbenberg, the head of equity research for the European transportation sector at Barclays.In November, Ryanair announced its first-ever dividend of roughly $430 million. The stock rose 8% on the back of that announcement.In order for O’Leary to earn the bonus payment, Ryanair will also have to see net profits of €2.2 billion, which analysts expect to happen. Ryanair has cut its profit forecast for 2023, saying it had to lower prices to keep planes full for various reasons, including the Boeing disaster with Alaska Airlines.O’Leary has been the chief executive of Ryanair since 1994 and is considered to be the executive that powered the budget airline to such a prominent status in Europe. To consumers, Ryanair is known for its cheap flights across the continent. For example, a flight from London to Berlin costs just $25 dollars. To shareholders, O’Leary is known for delivering meaningful gains as he’s driven the stock price up 28% over the past 12 months. He also successfully steered the company out of the pandemic-induced travel slump that plagued airlines in 2020 and early 2021. O’Leary has brought Ryanair’s stock up 137% since it plummeted to its low of €8.45 in May 2020.The case for why Ryanair’s strong performance might not continue hinges on its relationship with Boeing. The aircraft manufacturer was slated to deliver 57 737 Max planes to Ryanair this summer. Ten of those planes were reportedly already going to be late. Now, the rest of the order could be in jeopardy as well, as Boeing contends with the fallout from its recent maintenance disaster when the door of a plane blew off mid-flight at roughly 16,000 feet. Shortly after that incident O’Leary reiterated his commitment to Boeing, saying he would be happy to purchase leftover aircraft if other airlines canceled their orders. That wasn’t without chastising Boeing publicly for ignoring what he said were repeated warnings over two years to address maintenance issues. O’Leary later said he wasn’t sure if the Federal Aviation Administration’s investigation into Boeing would delay Ryanair’s order.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comRelated Quotes`['RYAAY', 'BA']`
Analysis-Boeing strikes conciliatory tone with suppliers amid 737 MAX crisis`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-boeing-strikes-conciliatory-tone-163747086.html`2024-02-09 16:37:47`"By Valerie InsinnaSEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing executives extended an olive branch to the company's strained supply chain this week to help them deal with the fallout of the latest 737 MAX crisis, but those firms are taking a wait-and-see attitude after years of dealing with the planemaker's hard-line approach.The aerospace giant's shift in tone was underlined by a speech on Wednesday by Ihssane Mounir, Boeing's vice president of supply chain and fabrication, at an aerospace conference outside Seattle. ""We build the airplane together. There's no you and us. It's just us,"" he said.Mounir's remarks - and those of Boeing's head of supplier quality on Tuesday - were the first public addresses by Boeing to its base of more than 1,100 suppliers in the Pacific Northwest region after a Jan. 5 mid-air blowout on a Boeing 737 MAX 9 that has rocked the aerospace industry.Multiple suppliers who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity said Mounir's comments marked a shift in tone from Boeing's previous strategy for driving supply-chain efficiency and cost-reduction, exemplified by the company's notorious ""Partnering for Success"" initiative in the 2010s.The initiative, which cut supply-chain costs by 15%, was unpopular with suppliers who said Boeing had profited on the backs of a squeezed industrial base. The planemaker has said in the past that the program was necessary to assure the company's long-term competitive advantage.One supplier said this week that they were ""cautiously optimistic,"" but added that Boeing must demonstrate its willingness to give under-pressure suppliers enough time to ensure products are properly manufactured and inspected.Two other suppliers were skeptical, saying that Boeing would need to prove Mounir's comments were more than lip service.Mounir's remarks marked a return by Boeing to the Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance conference after a two-year absence.Boeing declined to comment.THE 'NEW NORMAL'Boeing is under fire from regulators and lawmakers after the MAX 9 accident near Portland, Oregon. The Federal Aviation Administration is now blocking further production increases of the company's bestselling 737 MAX. The planemaker has said it is producing 38 737s per month.The cap on 737 MAX production hit at a time when airline demand for new planes is at an all-time high and the supply chain is still struggling with the reverberations of COVID-19 that prompted an exodus of experienced workers and led to materials shortages.Boeing has told 737 suppliers to carry on with planned production rate hikes to try to mitigate financial distress to small and midsized businesses, many of which have hired workers and invested in new equipment.Instead of talk about cost-cutting and speeding up production - common during the ""Partnering for Success"" era - Mounir repeatedly emphasized that Boeing and its supply chain must work together to ensure manufacturing standards are followed and quality is uncompromised.Mounir acknowledged ""a lot of tribal knowledge"" had been lost during the pandemic, urging suppliers to join a recently launched forum where companies can share best practices.He told suppliers to speak up and said Boeing was committed to providing assistance to vulnerable companies, including obtaining raw materials, engineering help or financial relief.Analysts said Boeing may have no choice but to take suppliers' concerns more seriously, as the dwindling supply base leaves planemakers with few other options.Suppliers have yet to understand that a ""new normal"" has emerged where they have more leverage than ever to ask for beneficial contract terms, such as long-term agreements and better inflation pricing adjustments, Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag said during the conference.""You now have the strategic power in the relationship,"" she said.(Reporting by Valerie Insinna in Seattle; Editing by Matthew Lewis)Related Quotes"`['BA']`

RBA Keeps Rate at 12-Year High, Signals Higher Bar for Rate Hikes`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rba-keeps-rate-12-high-033520613.html`2024-02-06 06:31:16`(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s central bank left interest rates at a 12-year high and signaled further tightening remains possible, joining global peers in pushing back against expectations for near-term easing and sending the currency and bond yields higher.Most Read from BloombergKing Charles Treated for Cancer in New Royal Health ScareWhy NYC Apartment Buildings Are on Sale Now for 50% OffChina Tightens Some Trading Restrictions for Domestic and Offshore InvestorsXi to Discuss China Stocks With Regulators as Rescue Bets BuildEastern Europe’s Richest Woman Pivots $43 Billion Empire WestThe Reserve Bank maintained its cash rate at 4.35% — as predicted by economists — on Tuesday, and said in a post-meeting statement that “a further increase in interest rates cannot be ruled out.”At her inaugural conference following the rate decision, RBA Governor Michele Bullock reiterated the board’s hawkish stance as she emphasized that inflation remained “too high.” The messaging prompted the currency to rise against all its major peers and swaps traders to bet the RBA will trail counterparts from the Federal Reserve to the Bank of England in policy easing this year.“We are not ruling in anything or out anything,” Bullock said. She signaled that taming inflation was taking priority over the desire to provide relief to heavily-indebted mortgage holders, saying “we need to stay the course.”The governor defended the RBA’s surprise November interest-rate hike, noting it was needed to guard against upside risks to inflation. Risks now appear “fairly balanced,” she said.The Australian dollar rose as much as 0.5% to 65.17 US cents, while yields on policy sensitive three-year government bonds were up 2 basis points to 3.70%. Swaps traders now see the chance of a June rate cut at 42% from about 50% beforehand, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The RBA “retains a mild tightening bias in contrast to the Fed, BoC, ECB and BoE,” said Su-Lin Ong, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, adding the statement was “more hawkish” than markets expected.“The language around inflation is strong despite downward revisions.”The RBA also released its quarterly forecasts which showed core inflation will only hit the midpoint of its 2-3% target band in 2026. The trimmed mean measure, which smooths volatile items, came in at 4.2% in the final three months of 2023.Read more: RBA Sees Inflation Hitting 2.5% Target Mid-Point in 2026The extended timeframe for inflation to return to target suggests the RBA will stick to its view that rates need to remain at elevated levels for some time, according to money markets and economists. That suggests Australia may be one of the last dollar-bloc economies to begin easing, they said.Underlining that, rates traders expect the RBA to hold off policy easing until later in the year, while they are certain the Fed will begin cuts by June. Australia’s central bank is seen as likely to undertake two quarter-point reductions this year, while the Fed is seen delivering as many as five.“Maintaining a tightening bias signals to the fiscal authorities that it’s too early to declare the inflation fight over,” said Gareth Aird, head of Australia economics at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. “The RBA would not wish to see fiscal settings loosened until further progress on inflation has been made towards the target band.”Reinforcing that theme, Bullock noted in her press conference that Australian governments are “keenly aware” of inflation risks.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Americans may have to wait beyond March for the central bank to cut rates as officials look for more economic data to confirm that inflation is headed down to 2%. In an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes that aired Sunday evening, Powell said the “danger of moving too soon is that the job’s not quite done.”Bullock did not provide a timeline on the RBA’s next moves in either direction, saying optionality on rates is needed as the board remains squarely data-dependent.What Bloomberg Economics Says...“We think the evolution of inflation, demand and the labor market over coming months will lead the RBA to not only pivot to neutral, but to begin cutting rates as soon as May.”— James McIntyre, economist— For the full note, click hereThe RBA moved cautiously during its tightening campaign — its 4.25 percentage points of hikes was 1 point less than the US and New Zealand delivered. Another reason for expectations the RBA will be slower on the way down is the disinflation impulse so far in Australia is weaker than elsewhere, with productivity growth among the weakest in the developed world.At the same time, Australia’s labor market remains solid and the economy has shown resilience to higher borrowing costs, suggesting there’s no urgency to shift quickly to easing. Moreover, policymakers won’t want to further fuel house prices that have been driven up by a supply shortage and high immigration.“We do not expect any further rate increases by the RBA this cycle,” said Luci Ellis, chief economist at Westpac Banking Corp. and a former RBA official. “Rate cuts are still some way off, though. The RBA board will need to be sufficiently comfortable that inflation will definitely decline into the 2–3% target band.”--With assistance from Garfield Reynolds.(Adds comments from press conference from third paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekBloomberg New Economy Is Looking for World-Changing Leaders A Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin AmericaIs It Morning in Joe Biden’s America?Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion PaydayMano dura de El Salvador contra el crimen seduce a América Latina©2024 Bloomberg L.P.Related Quotes`['AGKSWG.AX', 'AGOSWG.AX', 'AMCSWG.AX', 'AMPIWA.AX', 'AMPSWG.AX', 'AMPSWH.AX', 'ANNSWG.AX', 'ANZIWA.AX', 'ANZSWG.AX', 'ANZSWH.AX', 'ANZSWJ.AX', 'ANZSWK.AX', 'ANZSWN.AX', 'ANZSWO.AX', 'ASXSWG.AX', 'ASXSWL.AX', 'BHPIWA.AX', 'BHPSWG.AX', 'BHPSWH.AX', 'BHPSWJ.AX', 'BHPSWO.AX', 'BSLSWG.AX', 'BSLSWH.AX', 'BSLSWI.AX', 'BXBIWA.AX', 'BXBSWG.AX', 'BXBSWL.AX', 'CBAIWA.AX', 'CBASWG.AX', 'CBASWJ.AX', 'CBASWK.AX', 'CBASWN.AX', 'CBASWO.AX', 'CCLSWG.AX', 'COHSWG.AX', 'CPUSWG.AX', 'CSLSWG.AX', 'CSLSWH.AX', 'CSLSWK.AX', 'CWNSWG.AX', 'CWNSWL.AX', 'FMGSWG.AX', 'GMGSWG.AX', 'GPTSWG.AX', 'HSOSWL.AX', 'IAGSWG.AX', 'IAGSWH.AX', 'ILCSWG.AX', 'ILCSWH.AX', 'ILCSWI.AX', 'IOFSWG.AX', 'IOZIWA.AX', 'IOZSWG.AX', 'IOZSWH.AX', 'IPLSWG.AX', 'LLCSWG.AX', 'MGRSWG.AX', 'MQGIWA.AX', 'MQGSWG.AX', 'MQGSWH.AX', 'MQGSWL.AX', 'NABIWA.AX', 'NABSWG.AX', 'NABSWJ.AX', 'NABSWK.AX', 'NABSWN.AX', 'NABSWO.AX', 'NCMIWA.AX', 'NCMSWG.AX', 'NCMSWK.AX', 'NCMSWL.AX', 'ORGIWA.AX', 'ORGSWG.AX', 'ORGSWH.AX', 'ORISWG.AX', 'OZLSWG.AX', 'OZLSWL.AX', 'QANSWG.AX', 'QANSWH.AX', 'QBESWG.AX', 'QBESWH.AX', 'QBESWJ.AX', 'QOZSWL.AX', 'RHCSWG.AX', 'RHCSWL.AX', 'RIOIWA.AX', 'RIOSWG.AX', 'RIOSWH.AX', 'RIOSWJ.AX', 'RIOSWO.AX', 'SHLIWA.AX', 'SHLSWG.AX', 'SHLSWL.AX', 'STOSWG.AX', 'STWSWG.AX', 'STWSWH.AX', 'STWSWI.AX', 'STWSWO.AX', 'SUNSWG.AX', 'SUNSWK.AX', 'SYDSWG.AX', 'SYISWJ.AX', 'SYISWL.AX', 'TAHSWL.AX', 'TCLSWG.AX', 'TLSIWA.AX', 'TLSSWG.AX', 'TLSSWJ.AX', 'TLSSWK.AX', 'TLSSWN.AX', 'TLSSWO.AX', 'TOLSWG.AX', 'UGLSWG.AX', 'WBC.AX', 'WBCPE.AX', 'WBCPH.AX', 'WBCPI.AX', 'WBCPJ.AX', 'WBCPK.AX', 'WBCPL.AX', 'WBCPM.AX', 'WESSWG.AX', 'WESSWK.AX', 'WFDSWL.AX', 'WORSWG.AX', 'WOWIWA.AX', 'WOWSWG.AX', 'WOWSWJ.AX', 'WOWSWL.AX', 'WOWSWO.AX', 'WPLSWG.AX', 'WPLSWH.AX', 'WPLSWJ.AX', 'WPLSWO.AX', 'RBCPF', 'RY', 'RYBPF', 'RYLBF', 'AGKIYA.AX', 'AGKIYB.AX', 'AMCIYA.AX', 'AMCIYB.AX', 'AMPIYA.AX', 'AMPIYB.AX', 'ANZIYA.AX', 'ANZIYB.AX', 'ANZIYC.AX', 'ANZIYD.AX', 'ASXIYB.AX', 'AZJIYA.AX', 'AZJIYB.AX', 'BENIYA.AX', 'BENIYB.AX', 'BHPIYA.AX', 'BHPIYB.AX', 'BHPIYD.AX', 'BOQIYA.AX', 'BOQIYB.AX', 'BXBIYA.AX', 'BXBIYB.AX', 'CBA.AX', 'CBAPG.AX', 'CBAPH.AX', 'CBAPI.AX', 'CBAPJ.AX', 'CBAPK.AX', 'CBAPL.AX', 'CBAPM.AX', 'CCLIYA.AX', 'CCLIYB.AX', 'CPUIYA.AX', 'CPUIYB.AX', 'CSLIYA.AX', 'CSLIYB.AX', 'FMGIYA.AX', 'FMGIYB.AX', 'IAGIYA.AX', 'IAGIYB.AX', 'ILUIYA.AX', 'ILUIYB.AX', 'LLCIYA.AX', 'LLCIYB.AX', 'MQGIYA.AX', 'MQGIYB.AX', 'MQGIYC.AX', 'NABIYA.AX', 'NABIYB.AX', 'NABIYC.AX', 'NABIYD.AX', 'NCMIYA.AX', 'NCMIYB.AX', 'ORGIYA.AX', 'ORGIYB.AX', 'QBEIYA.AX', 'QBEIYB.AX', 'RIOIYA.AX', 'RIOIYB.AX', 'STOIYA.AX', 'STOIYB.AX', 'STWIYA.AX', 'STWIYB.AX', 'SUNIYA.AX', 'SUNIYB.AX', 'SYDIYA.AX', 'SYDIYB.AX', 'TAHIYA.AX', 'TAHIYB.AX', 'TCLIYA.AX', 'TCLIYB.AX', 'TLSIYA.AX', 'TLSIYB.AX', 'TLSIYC.AX', 'TLSIYD.AX', 'TOLIYA.AX', 'TOLIYB.AX', 'WBCIYA.AX', 'WBCIYB.AX', 'WBCIYC.AX', 'WBCIYD.AX', 'WESIYA.AX', 'WESIYB.AX', 'WOWIYA.AX', 'WOWIYB.AX', 'WPLIYA.AX', 'WPLIYB.AX', 'BAC']`
Commercial real estate a 'manageable' problem but some banks will close: Powell`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commercial-real-estate-a-manageable-problem-but-some-banks-will-close-powell-161201936.html`2024-02-05 16:12:01`"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is predicting that more small banks will likely close or merge due to commercial real estate weaknesses, but that the problem is ultimately ""manageable.""The central bank official made this point during a ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Sunday night. It was Powell’s first comments about the industry following a new bout of turmoil cascading through the stocks of many regional banks.""I don't think there's much risk of a repeat of 2008,"" Powell said, referring to a financial crisis 16 years ago that took down some of the biggest institutions on Wall Street as well as hundreds of banks across the US.""I do think it’s a manageable problem,"" he added.The new concerns about regional banks were triggered by $116 billion commercial real estate lender New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), which shocked Wall Street last Wednesday when it slashed its dividend, reported a surprise quarterly loss, and stockpiled millions for future loan losses related to commercial real estate holdings.The stock of the Hicksville, N.Y.-based lender fell 38% on Wednesday and another 11% on Thursday, dragging the rest of the sector down with it. The stocks recovered Friday but dropped once again on Monday as New York Community Bancorp fell more than 10%.Powell acknowledged in his ""60 Minutes"" interview that some smaller banks will ""have to be closed"" or merged ""out of existence"" due to losses tied to the falling values of properties across the US that are suddenly worth much less due to the Fed’s elevated interest rates and the effect of a pandemic that emptied out many city-center buildings.But ""we looked at the larger banks' balance sheets, and it appears to be a manageable problem,"" Powell said.""There's some smaller and regional banks that have concentrated exposures in these areas that are challenged. And, you know, we're working with them. This is something we've been aware of for, you know, a long time, and we're working with them to make sure that they have the resources and a plan to work their way through the expected losses.""Regional banks are particularly vulnerable because they hold a lot more exposure to these properties than larger rivals. For banks with more than $100 billion in assets, commercial real estate loans only account for 13% of total credit. For smaller banks, they account for 44% of total bank credit.Loans tied to offices and certain multifamily housing properties are showing the most weakness. Not all segments of commercial real estate are expected to face the same problems.Demand for commercial real estate loans from US banks, meanwhile, weakened in the fourth quarter of 2023 as bank officers tightened their standards, according to a new Fed report released Monday. These officers expect standards to stay tight in 2024 on all loan categories except for residential real estate.David Chiaverini, a regional and midsized bank analyst for Wedbush Securities, told Yahoo Finance that commercial real estate ""will be managed better at some of the other banks"" than at New York Community Bancorp, which also has a high level of exposure to rent-controlled apartment complexes in New York City. Those buildings account for 22% of its loans.Chiaverini said the bank should have set aside more in reserves last year while booking a gain from its purchase of assets from the failed Signature Bank.""The severity of the issue is, I would say, mostly idiosyncratic to New York Community Bank because they were so under-reserved relative to the risk in their portfolio,"" he added.The ""perfect storm"" that could create problems for the rest of the industry, according to Chiaverini, is if inflation goes back up, forcing the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, and the US economy enters a recession. Borrowers would then have problems keeping up with their loans.If those things don’t happen, the commercial real estate pain should be ""manageable"" for the banks, he added.The Fed chair repeated that same word three times in his ""60 Minutes"" interview.""It should be manageable,"" Powell said.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRelated Quotes"`['BAC', 'WFC', 'KRE', '^GSPC', 'PNC', '^DJI', 'C', 'NYCB', 'NYCB-PA', '^KRX', 'JPM']`

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation, along with our earnings release issued this morning, which are both available on our website. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?Jose Almeida: Thank you, Clare, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us. I will begin with a brief overview of Baxter’s performance for the quarter and the year. After this, I will review our progress against the transformational actions we laid out for you just over a year ago, including the planned separation of our Kidney Care business. I will then turn it over to Joel Grade, who will walk through our results and outlook in more detail. Finally, we will open it up for your questions. As you saw this morning, Baxter reported strong performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 with top line sales exceeding our projections and bottom line results coming in at the high end of our guidance range.As a reminder, continuing operations exclude the impact of our biopharma solutions business, which we divested at the close of the third quarter. Sales from continuing operations rose 4% on a reported basis ahead of our outlook of 1% to 2% growth. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 3%, also ahead of our guidance, which projected growth of approximately 1%. Strength in the quarter was broad-based with year-over-year growth in the Healthcare Systems and Technologies, Medical Products and Therapies and Pharmaceuticals, which was slightly offset by an expected decline in Kidney Care. Relative to expectations, both of our chronic therapies and drug compounding divisions reported better-than-expected sales. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $0.88 at the top end of our prior guidance range of $0.85 to $0.88.Our fourth quarter results further reinforce our building momentum. In 2023, we focused on consistently meeting and/or exceeding our financial outlook, particularly in light of the significant supply chain and macro environmental challenges we encountered during 2022. As a testament to this focus, over the course of 2023, we were able to deliver sequential improvement every quarter, and we believe this performance provides us with a solid foundation to build off in 2024. Turning to the full year sales from continuing operations of $14.8 billion advanced 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by sales growth for all of our segments at constant currency rates. First, looking at the constant currency sales growth in the segment set to comprise our future Baxter portfolio following the planned Kidney Care separation.Sales in Healthcare Systems & Technologies were up 7% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the year. Medical Products and Therapies sales rose 4% in both the quarter and for the year, and sales in Pharmaceuticals were up 7% for both the quarter and the year. Performance in these segments was filled by strong execution across our commercial and manufacturing teams. New product launches increased the availability of electromechanical component and a more stable supply chain and macroeconomic environment relative to the significant volatility experienced last year. With respect to hospital capital spending, while we still believe there may be pockets of softer spending, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement we experienced every quarter in 2023 within our Care and Connectivity Solutions division.Our Kidney Care segment, which will be called Vantive post separation, declined 1% in the quarter and grew 1% for the year at constant rates. Strong growth in acute therapies was offset by flat growth in chronic therapies, reflecting a difficult year-over-year comparison due to certain discrete items that benefited sales in the prior year as well as lower sales in China due to the impact of government-based procurement initiatives and the lower patient census due to the pandemic. The underlying state of the Kidney Care business continues to improve and the momentum we are building is evident. Among key indicators, we are seeing renewed growth in the peritoneal dialysis patient population following the earlier impact of pandemic-driven mortality issues.Our strategic rationale and hypothesis for an independent Kidney Care business remains as strong as ever. Our team is executing and gearing up for a successful separation this year. Given overall business performance and environmental dynamics, I’m optimistic as we look ahead to the prospects for both Baxter and Vantive as separate entities. Our solid financial performance was achieved in parallel with meaningful progress against the strategic priorities we announced to open 2023. We kicked off the year with an urgency to rethink both the scope and velocity of our transformation. Since then, our team delivered executing on a range of goals to position a separated Baxter and Vantive for a new era of enhanced patient and shareholder impact, enabled by heightened strategic clarity, operational efficiency and innovation.We realigned our businesses into newly streamlined simplified operating model based on globally integrated business segments. Each segment is led by a seasoned and knowledgeable executive who has profit and loss accountability, inclusive of dedicated commercial research and development, manufacturing, supply chain and functional teams. We are already seeing the benefits of improved line of sight to our customers and greater agility to recognize and capture growth opportunities. We completed the divestiture of our biopharma solutions business at the close of Q3, which further allowed us to streamline our strategic focus on our core businesses. We are in the process of utilizing the after-tax proceeds of approximately $3.7 billion to pay down debt in line with our stated capital allocation priorities, including $2.8 billion of repayments in the fourth quarter.Finally, we continue to make progress towards separating Vantive out of Baxter. As we have consistently stated, we believe this separation will ultimately empower both companies to pursue their own unique strategic and investment priorities. Many of you had the opportunity to meet the designated Vantive CEO, Chris Toth at the JPMorgan conference last month. Chris has been hard at work building out his organization, meeting customers and setting near-term and long-term strategies. Among recent developments, Chris has onboarded Matt Harbaugh as designated Vantive CFO. Many of you may know Matt from his days as CFO at NuVasive. Meanwhile, we continue to hit key separation milestones across operational, legal, regulatory, supply chain IT domains.In summary, 2023 was a year of rebuilding and renewing our momentum. We made significant progress on an ambitious slate of strategic initiatives coupled with solid financial performance, while never losing focus on our foundational commitments to our customers and patients. Additionally, we have created a new potential to embrace more exciting opportunities to come. I do not take the accomplishments of this past year for granted, I want to thank and recognize all of the employees who hard work and commitment helped us to achieve our objectives. I have never been more impressed by what a team could achieve in a single year and that is why I’m so energized by our potential to seize on opportunities we have created together. Now we turn it over to Joel for a closer look at our fourth quarter and full year 2023 performance as well as our 2024 outlook.Joel Grade: Thanks, Joe and good morning, everyone. I’m happy to be joining the call this morning to provide some additional details on Baxter’s fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial performance as well as commentary on our financial outlook for 2024. As Joe mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, which represented another step forward in our on-going business transformation. Fourth quarter 2023 global sales of $3.9 billion increased 4% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis and compared favorably to our previously issued guidance of 1% to 2% reported and approximately 1% constant currency. Outperformance in the quarter benefited from better than expected sales in many product categories and particularly in chronic therapies and drug compounding.As compared to the prior year period, we reported solid quarterly growth in health care systems and technologies, pharmaceuticals and medical products and therapies. And collectively, sales for these three businesses, which will comprise Baxter post the separation, increased approximately 5%. As expected, Kidney Care sales declined slightly in the quarter due to the factors Joe mentioned earlier. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings totalled $0.88 per share, increasing 13% versus the prior year period. These results reflect the ongoing operational improvements we are recognizing both commercially, as well as within our supply chain network as that team successfully executes on its margin improvement programs. Lower interest expense and a benefit from foreign exchange also contributed favorably to the quarter, partially offset by the impact of a higher tax rate compared to the prior year.Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter came in at the high end of our expected range of $0.85 to $0.88 per share, primarily driven by better sales and operational performance. Now I’ll walk through performance by our reportable segments. Commentary regarding sales growth will reflect growth at constant currency rates. Sales in our Medical Products and Therapies segments were $1.3 billion, increasing 4%. Full year 2023 sales totalled $5 billion also advancing 4%. Within Medical products and therapies, fourth quarter sales from our Infusion Therapies and Technologies division totalled $1 billion and increased 4%. Sales in the quarter benefited from strength in our IV Solutions portfolio, particularly outside the United States, as well as solid performance in our infusion system portfolio.Sales from Advanced Surgery totalled $278 million and grew 6%, coming in ahead of expectations and reflecting strong growth internationally. For our Healthcare Systems & Technologies or HST segment, sales in the quarter were $795 million and increased 7%. Full year 2023 sales totalled $3 billion, advancing 3%, within the HST segment, sales in our Care & Connectivity Solutions, or CCS division or $492 million, increasing 11%. Performance in the quarter benefited from double-digit growth in all key product categories within the division, including our care communications, surgical solutions and Patient Support Systems product offerings. Growth in the quarter was partially offset by lower contribution from rental revenues. Fourth quarter United States orders within CCS continued to improve sequentially, but notably also grew on a year-over-year basis for the first time in 2023.While we are encouraged by the improvement in capital spending we’ve seen from our U.S. hospital customers, we continue to believe there may still be select pockets of cautiousness in the marketplace. Front Line Care sales in the quarter were $303 million, increasing 2%, given the improvements in electromechanical component availability over the course of 2023, we’re able to successfully address our elevated backlog and exited the year at more normalized levels. Sales in our Pharmaceuticals segment were $596 million, increasing 7%. For the full year, sales were $2.2 billion, also advancing 7%. Performance in the quarter reflected double-digit growth in our U.S. injectables portfolio driven by new product launches, as well as continued strong demand for our services within our drug compounding portfolio internationally.Other sales, which represent sales not allocated to a segment and primarily include sales of products and services provided directly through certain of our manufacturing facilities were $18 million and declined 58% during the quarter in line with our expectations. This lower level of sales reflects reduced demand for certain contract manufacturing volumes and the termination of a royalty arrangement. Moving on to Kidney Care, sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion and declined 1%. Full year 2023 sales totalled $4.5 billion and increased 1%. Within Kidney Care, global sales for chronic therapies were $950 million, declining 3%, though as mentioned earlier, came in better than expected. Sales growth in the quarter was impacted by a difficult comparison to the prior year period, which included certain discrete items in the U.S. that totalled approximately $25 million.Finally, performance in chronic therapies continues to be impacted by lower sales in China due to certain government-based procurement initiatives and a lower patient census due to the pandemic. We estimate that collectively, these country-specific factors negatively impacted sales by approximately $35 million in the quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $206 million, representing growth of 6% with strength across most regions, including double-digit growth in the United States, where we’ve now rebased this business following the pandemic-related benefits we previously experienced. Now moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin totalled 42% and represented an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year.The year-over-year improvement in gross margin primarily reflects the stabilization of macroeconomic factors and inflationary pressures that previously contributed to higher cost for raw materials, overhead and labor that impacted our margins earlier in the year. Margin improvement in the quarter also benefited from pricing initiatives in select markets and on-going margin improvement programs in our integrated supply chain network. Performance for the quarter was inline with our expectations as topline outperformance in the quarter was driven by lower-margin divisions, which drove a slightly negative gross profit mix in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totalled $829 million or 21.3% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 20 basis points versus the prior year period.Performance in the quarter benefited from our on-going transformation initiatives to enhance operational efficiencies, offset by higher bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans compared to the prior year and select investments in sales and marketing initiatives. Adjusted Research & Development spending in the quarter totalled $172 million and represented 4.4% as a percentage of sales, increasing 20 basis points versus the prior year. We have ramped up our R&D efforts, particularly increasing our investments in advancing new products across the portfolio and like SG&A, R&D expenses include the impact of higher employee incentive accruals as compared to the prior year period. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 16.2% and an increase of 30 basis points.Overall, we are very pleased with the second half margin expansion we’re able to realize with operating margins improving approximately 300 basis points in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of 2023. Net interest expense totalled $73 million in the quarter, a decrease of $44 million versus the prior year and down $55 million sequentially, driven by debt repayment of approximately $2.8 billion associated with the utilization of the proceeds from our BPS divestiture. We plan to continue to repay debt in 2024, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities. Adjusted other non-operating income, totalled $11 million in the quarter compared to an expense of $11 million in the prior year period. Year-over-year improvement was largely due to lower foreign exchange losses incurred as compared with the prior year period.The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.0% compared to 14.6% in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by statute expirations on certain tax positions benefiting the prior year period. The tax rate in the quarter came in higher than expected, primarily driven by changes in geographic earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings totalled $0.88 and increased 13% versus the prior year, primarily driven by better-than-expected sales and operational efficiencies, as well as lower interest expense, partially offset by the tax rate in the quarter. For the full year, Baxter’s adjusted earnings from continuing operations decreased 14% to $2.60 per diluted share, reflecting the impact of higher cost of goods sold, driven primarily by the macro environmental factors we previously discussed, greater annual employee bonus accruals, as well as increased non-operating expenses.These factors were partially offset by our operational and supply chain savings initiatives. With respect to cash flow, we generated free cash flow for the year of over $1 billion from continuing operations compared to $411 million in the prior year period. Going forward, cash flow generation and in particular, improving our working capital metrics is a key priority both for me and the Baxter team. To close on our full year results, we are pleased with our operating performance through 2023, which reflected both consistent progress and building momentum. And it is important to note that our teams were able to achieve this performance, while also making meaningful progress against our strategic initiatives designed to enhance our future performance and drive incremental value for all stakeholders.We look forward to building on that positive momentum as we enter 2024. Let me conclude my remarks by discussing our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance. For full year 2024, Baxter expects total sales growth of 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, as the impact from foreign exchange is currently expected to be minimal on a full year basis. Constant currency sales guidance for the full year by reportable segments is as follows; for Medical Products and Therapies, we expect sales growth of 3% to 4%; sales in our Healthcare Systems and Technology segments are expected to increase approximately 3%; we expect Pharmaceuticals sales growth of 4% to 5%. Collectively, sales for these remaining Baxter businesses are expected to increase 3% to 4% in 2024; for Kidney Care, we expect sales growth to decline 1% to 2% as compared to 2023.Factors impacting year-over-year growth are primarily driven by select market and product exits in connection with our margin expansion initiatives for this segment which we estimate will negatively impact sales by approximately $150 million. Additionally, the incremental impact from the ongoing government procurement initiatives in China is expected to total approximately $70 million in 2024. Now turning to our outlook for other P&L line items. We expect adjusted operating margin to increase by at least 50 basis points in 2024. We expect our non-operating expenses, which include net interest expense and other income and expense to total approximately $350 million in aggregate during 2024. We anticipate a full year adjusted tax rate between 22.0% and 22.5%, which reflects an approximate 100 basis point impact to the 2024 tax rate from the implementation of Pillar 2 [ph].We expect our diluted share count to increase slightly and average 510 million shares for the year. Based on all these factors, we anticipate full year adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.85 to $2.95 per diluted share. Specific to the first quarter of 2024, we expect global sales growth of approximately 1% on a reported basis and 1% to 2% on a constant currency basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.59 to $0.62 per diluted share. With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A.Operator: Thank you.

Decoding Baxter International Inc (BAX): A Strategic SWOT Insight`https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decoding-baxter-international-inc-bax-051457193.html`2024-02-09 05:14:57`Comprehensive SWOT analysis based on Baxter International Inc's latest SEC 10-K filing.Strategic evaluation of Baxter's operational shifts and market positioning.Financial overview highlighting Baxter's revenue streams and recent divestitures.Forward-looking insights into Baxter's innovation and market expansion strategies.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with BAX.On February 8, 2024, Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) filed its annual 10-K report, providing a detailed overview of its financial performance and strategic direction. The company, a leading provider of medical instruments and supplies, has recently undergone significant strategic actions, including the acquisition of Hillrom and the proposed spinoff of its Kidney Care business. Baxter's financial tables reveal a stable revenue generation with $4.45 billion from its Kidney Care segment in both 2023 and 2022, accounting for approximately 30% of its consolidated net sales. The divestiture of its BioPharma Solutions (BPS) business brought in cash proceeds of $3.96 billion, bolstering the company's financial position. This SWOT analysis delves into Baxter's internal and external factors that influence its competitive edge and future growth prospects.Robust Product Portfolio and Innovation: Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) stands out for its diversified healthcare products, which cater to a wide range of medical needs. The company's strengths are rooted in its ability to innovate and expand its product offerings. For instance, the acquisition of Hillrom has significantly enhanced Baxter's portfolio, particularly in connected care solutions like smart bed systems and patient monitoring technologies. The company's focus on innovation is evident in its investment in new product launches and geographic expansions, such as smart pump technology and surgical sealants. These initiatives not only demonstrate Baxter's commitment to growth but also position it as a leader in medical technology.Global Presence and Market Expansion: Baxter's global footprint is a testament to its strength, with manufacturing in over 20 countries and products sold in over 100. The company's strategic pillar of market expansion has been successful in leveraging its geographic reach to introduce products into new markets and increase the adoption of underpenetrated therapies. This global presence not only diversifies revenue streams but also mitigates risks associated with market-specific downturns. Baxter's ability to navigate international markets and regulatory landscapes is a competitive advantage that supports its long-term growth.Operational Complexity and Integration Challenges: Despite its strengths, Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) faces challenges related to the complexity of its operations, particularly following the integration of Hillrom. The company has acknowledged the need for a new operating model to simplify operations and better align manufacturing with commercial activities. This transition period could present risks in terms of operational efficiency and cost management. Additionally, the integration process may lead to short-term disruptions that could impact Baxter's service delivery and customer relationships.Dependence on Kidney Care Segment: Baxter's reliance on its Kidney Care segment, which accounted for about 30% of its consolidated net sales, is a potential weakness. The planned spinoff of this segment into an independent company by mid-2024 could lead to short-term financial instability and necessitate a strategic realignment. While the spinoff is aimed at enhancing stockholder value, it also exposes Baxter to the risks of losing a significant revenue contributor and the need to strengthen other segments to compensate for this change.Connected Care and Digital Health Expansion: The healthcare industry's shift towards digitalization presents significant opportunities for Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX). The company's acquisition of Hillrom, with its digitally connected offerings like smart beds and medical communications apps, positions Baxter at the forefront of the connected care revolution. The growing demand for telehealth and remote patient monitoring solutions could drive Baxter's growth in this space, as healthcare providers seek to improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency through technology.Strategic Divestitures and Capital Allocation: Baxter's recent strategic actions, including the sale of its BPS business and the proposed spinoff of its Kidney Care business, reflect a deliberate capital allocation strategy. These moves are expected to streamline Baxter's operations and focus on higher-margin segments. The capital raised from these divestitures provides Baxter with the financial flexibility to invest in growth areas, reduce debt, and potentially return value to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases.Competitive Landscape and Pricing Pressures: Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) operates in a highly competitive medical products market, where innovation and pricing are key differentiators. The company faces competition from both established players and new entrants, which could lead to pricing pressures and reduced market share. Baxter must continuously innovate and offer cost-effective solutions to maintain its competitive position and address the risk of declining demand in certain product categories.Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The medical device and healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and Baxter is subject to stringent quality and safety standards. Compliance with these regulations is critical to the company's operations. Any quality issues or regulatory non-compliance could result in product recalls, legal penalties, and damage to Baxter's reputation. Additionally, changes in healthcare policies and reimbursement rates could impact the demand for Baxter's products and services, posing a threat to its financial stability.In conclusion, Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) exhibits a strong market position with its diversified product portfolio, global presence, and strategic focus on innovation and market expansion. However, the company must navigate operational complexities, reliance on its Kidney Care segment, and the competitive landscape. Opportunities in connected care and strategic capital allocation present avenues for growth, while regulatory challenges and pricing pressures remain significant threats.
