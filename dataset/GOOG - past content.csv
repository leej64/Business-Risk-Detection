The software-as-a-service provider is expected to raise $850 million, which will make it the biggest technology IPO of the year, the Journal reports.If the record label finds success in going public, it could give the confidence for other companies to follow suit, which are otherwise in the wait-and-watch mood due to the pandemic, the Journal noted.The New York-based company was expected to price the IPO late Tuesday but delayed the move in light of the ongoing protests following George Floyd's death, according to the Journal.The music industry called for a ""Blackout Tuesday,"" and companies, including Spotify Technology S.A. (SPOT), and music divisions of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL, GOOG), and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), participated by temporarily suspending operations, The Verge reported.Warner Music is now expected to decide on the IPO pricing in a meeting early Wednesday ahead of the listing, the Journal noted.Or Sign in withThe comment was deleted!

The stock had closed the regular session 6.2% higher at $2.59.Western Union shares were up 6.2% in the after-hours at $22 after closing the regular session 3.5% higher at $20.71. Or Sign in withThe comment was deleted!
