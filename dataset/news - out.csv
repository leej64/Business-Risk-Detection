Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners`"In this article, we discuss 10 best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners. Global stocks reached their highest point in over two years, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record high on February 7, as per Reuters. This was driven by robust earnings, which helped counter concerns surrounding US regional banks and the Chinese markets. Bonds experienced slight pressure, as statements from Federal Reserve officials reinforced the expectation that the central bank might not reduce interest rates in the near future. According to Arthur Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth: ""We are at the midpoint of the 4Q earnings reporting season, and we would say that there has been more good news than bad.""In 2023, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 26.29%, recovering from the setback of 18.11% in 2022. In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts. The potential combination of declining interest rates and earnings growth is seen as a positive for stocks. However, analysts express worries about overvalued technology sector stocks, and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to introduce significant market volatility.Looking at historical data from 1921 to 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research, noted that the average S&P 500 bull market has yielded a return of 157% and lasted over four years. This historical pattern suggests the possibility of the stock market rally continuing in the foreseeable future. One notable success in the current bull market has been the performance of artificial intelligence technology as an investment theme. AI stocks were among the top performers in 2023, contributing to the market's overall positive trajectory. James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, commented: “The market’s recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI.” On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee suggests a more cautious outlook for 2024, anticipating an average year for markets rather than double-digit gains. Concerns include the S&P 500's elevated forward price/earnings ratio and a historically low equity risk premium. Valuations indicate potential sub-par annual stock returns, with estimates pointing to a 4% gain compared to the long-run average of 7%-8%. Analysts' optimistic projections for 2024 U.S. corporate earnings are questioned, with expectations of a tapering in economic growth from 7% to 4%. The market's assumption of a more aggressive Fed rate-cutting stance contrasts with public signals, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions as emergency programs wind down in 2024.Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, remarked: “As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.” Some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology For this list, we used a stock screener and selected stable companies with high single digit or low-teens revenue growth. Then, we arranged them via market cap to get the largest companies. We selected the top stocks for beginners based on revenue growth and hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter of 2023. The list is sorted in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders. Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Quarterly Revenue Growth: 14.10%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company in the United States with four segments – UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. UnitedHealthcare offers health benefit plans for employers and individuals, Medicaid plans, and children's health insurance.On January 12, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $6.16 and a revenue of $94.4 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.17 and $2.22 billion, respectively. Revenue for the period increased 14% on a year-over-year basis. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 104 hedge funds held stakes worth nearly $11 billion in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared to 111 funds in the prior quarter worth $10.1 billion. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.2 million shares worth $1.6 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best cheap stocks for beginners. Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) contributed less to portfolio performance than the majority of our holdings during the quarter. The Company reported double-digit revenue, operating earnings and earnings per share growth during their third quarter. The Company has been able to adjust pricing in its health care segment to keep up with medical cost inflation while working with its Optum units to deliver more value-based care that replaces the traditional fee for service health care model. Value-based care is a sensible, long-term growth opportunity for the Company to pursue and also differentiates it from the vast majority of healthcare providers, particularly as it relates to Medicare patients. For example, the Company’s value-based care programs provide more preventative care opportunities and home-based care visits for patients which helps save the U.S. healthcare system billions in unnecessary spending while also providing patients with better outcomes, as diseases and behaviors are caught or corrected at earlier stages. The Company has invested in several core assets over many years to execute this value-based strategy and it will become the standard of care as the proportion of people in the U.S. with healthcare insurance coverage continues to reach new highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.00%JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a global financial services company operating in four segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management. It is one of the top cheap beginner stocks to watch. On February 6, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced that it intends to initiate a substantial expansion over the next three years, involving the commencement of 500 new branches, renovation of 1,700 locations, and the hiring of 3,500 staff members. The expansion will focus on reaching low-income and rural communities in new markets. Upon completion, this initiative will result in over 1,100 added branches and more than 10,500 new hires in its Consumer Bank team since 2018. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 109 hedge funds were long JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), compared to 106 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 11.3 million shares worth $1.65 billion. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We updated the sustainable scorecard for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). JP Morgan continues to have an Average rating across Governance, Social and Environmental factors. JP Morgan is using its business to improve climate change. JP Morgan has targeted $2.5 trillion in financing between 2021 and 2030 to advance long-term solutions to address climate change and sustainable development. The Board has oversight of corporate responsibility and ESG matters, but ESG and Sustainability are addressed across the firm. JPM does listen to shareholders. After a 31% For Vote on executive compensation in 2022, the Board will not be granting any special awards to Jamie Dimon or Daniel Pinto and if awarded to other Named Executive Officers, there will be a direct performance condition associated with the award. The Compensation Committee limited the cash percentage of Dimon and Pinto’s compensation.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Quarterly Revenue Growth: 10.20%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, and other products for data centers, gaming, and embedded applications. It is one of the best cheap beginner stocks to invest in. On February 1, Citi analyst Christopher Danely observed that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, anticipating $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi suggested that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) may intentionally be underestimating, and the company's CEO expressed confidence in surpassing the $3.5 billion figure for this year. The analyst estimated that AMD could generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from its MI300, according to buy-side investors' expectations.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion. White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.60%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), a diversified software company, operates globally through three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. The Digital Media segment offers products and services for content creation and promotion, including the flagship product Creative Cloud. The Digital Experience segment provides a platform for brands and businesses to manage and optimize customer experiences. The Publishing and Advertising segment offers various products and services, such as e-learning solutions and Advertising Cloud offerings. On December 13, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $4.27 and a revenue of $5.05 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.13 and $30 million, respectively. The company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares during the fourth quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.30%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a global provider of customer relationship management technology, facilitating the connection between companies and customers. The company's services include sales tools for data management, lead monitoring, progress tracking, and analytics. Salesforce also offers a platform allowing businesses to build custom apps, an online learning platform, and Slack for collaboration. On January 30, BofA designated Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) as one of their top picks for 2024. According to BofA Analyst Brad Sills, Salesforce is strategically positioned to further gain market share in the cumulative $200 billion market. Sills highlighted Salesforce's competitive advantage with a significant market share of only 15% and a robust moat derived from its extensive installed base of over 150,000 customers in the core sales/front office category.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 122 hedge funds were bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), same as the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with roughly 15 million shares worth $4 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) ranks 6th on our list of the top cheap stocks for beginners in 2024. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners.  Suggested articles:Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks15 Best Bitcoin Wallets For iPhone and Android11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:43:39.362364`AMZN
Do Not Fight this Market: 3 Top Ranked Stock to Join the Rally`After such a strong finish in 2023 and follow through at the start of 2024, investors are wondering when the correction is coming. While it is natural to expect some sort of pull-back I think investors would be best off not trying to predict, and instead continue buying top-ranked stocks.Below we can see the Nasdaq 100 is breaking out of this bullish looking consolidation, and the S&P 500 is very nearly pushing through the 5,000 level.Image Source: TradingViewFurthermore, there are many powerful investment themes keeping the markets bid, including a robust economy, exciting technological developments, and tremendous government spending deficits. That last item is definitely worth considering when wondering when the economy is going to slowdown.Because of the massive spending behind the most recent infrastructure bill, where more than $1 trillion is going to be spent, many laid off workers are likely to be soaked up by the public sector, and spending to continue.Based on these influential economic developments, investors should focus on continuing to buy leading stocks with top Zacks ranks, because a major economic slowdown is becoming less and less likely.Here I will share three stocks with top Zacks ranks, and market beating performance over the last month. I particularly like to look for stocks showing relative strength while the market continues to grind higher.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMercadoLibreMercadoLibre MELI, is the Latin-American version of Amazon, building an e-commerce platform that continues to boom in popularity. MercadoLibre has been one of the most exciting stocks in the last few years and its returns continue to delight investors willing to own shares.In addition to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, the company is forecasting impressive growth in sales and earnings.This year, sales are expected to climb 36% YoY to $14.3 billion, while EPS are set to expand 134% to $22.30 per share. That growth is projected to continue on to the next year as well, with sales expected to grow 22.3% the following year, and EPS to increase 57.6%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to the fundamental developments in MercadoLibre, its technical advances are compelling as well. In addition to relative strength against the market, it has been forming a very nice technical trade pattern to measure a breakout trade from.For investors waiting for a technical signal to enter MELI, a move above $1764 would market a clean breakout from this bullish consolidation.Image Source: TradingViewStoneCoStoneCo STNE is a Brazilian financial technology company specializing in payment processing solutions. Founded in 2012, StoneCo provides a range of services, including electronic payments, credit card processing, and point-of-sale technology for businesses of varying sizes.StoneCo has seen earnings estimates steadily trend higher over the last 10 months, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Additionally, the company is entering a period where EPS are expected to expand significantly. Earnings are forecast to grow 167% YoY this year, and 36.1% next year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MercadoLibre, StoneCo stock is forming a convincing technical pattern. STNE stock was hit hard at the end of 2022 and traded sideways at a depressed level for nearly two years.However, at the end of 2023, the stock initiated a stage one breakout, indicating investors had been buying the depressed stock. Now over the last two months, STNE price action has built out a weekly bull flag, leading me to believe another big breakout is coming.If STNE stock trades above the $18.50 level, investors could rush in to buy the stock sending it significantly higher.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon.comFinally, one of the world's leading companies, Amazon AMZN just reported an incredibly strong quarter of financials sending the stock much higher.Following the earnings gap up, Amazon stock is forming a post earnings consolidation, a very high probability trading setup. Above $171 and AMZN should make a run at its all-time high.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon has also been garnering interest from analysts, who have been steadily upgrading earnings estimates. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 22% and current quarter earnings by 12.5%.Earnings at the e-commerce and technology giant are expected to grow by an impressive 28.1% annually over the next 3-5 years, driven by its AWS and new advertising business segments.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe great thing about investing in stocks is that the best ones offer tremendous asymmetric opportunities. There is no reason to try and predict market selloffs, because so long as you focus on buying top-tier securities, the returns take care of themselves. That is not to say that risk management isn’t key, but good investors are often optimists. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Down 61% in the Past Year, Has This E-Commerce Stock Entered Bargain Territory?`The last 12 months were a good period in general for e-commerce stocks. Companies like Amazon, Shopify, MercadoLibre, and Pinduoduo saw their share prices rise at least 30%.But the industry had its laggards too, including JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), which saw its shares fall 61% in the past year. With the stock now down 78% from its all-time high, JD.com has attracted some investors looking to take advantage of a potential bargain.But before you rush into the stock, you should understand how JD.com got here in the first place. Only then can you make an informed investment decision.JD.com is one of the more successful companies replicating Amazon's playbook.The e-commerce giant operates a first-party e-commerce business in China by selling a wide range of products directly to customers. It also operates a third-party marketplace that allows other sellers on its platform, in exchange for fees from each successful transaction.The company emphasizes low prices to encourage customers to buy more over time, and it operates a complex logistics service to offer speedy deliveries. The low prices and fast delivery leads to strong customer retention and sales growth, providing JD.com with the scale needed to drive prices even lower and continuously improve its service.Customers love the approach, which explains the company's uninterrupted growth for many years. For perspective, revenue grew revenue at a compound annual rate of 27% from 2017 to 2021. Everything seemed to be moving in the right direction until recently.Investors accustomed to such an impressive track record were disappointed when the e-commerce company reported just 10% revenue growth in 2022. Subsequent months were even more challenging for the company with revenue growth declining to just 2% in Q3 2023. Revenue from its flagship first-party e-commerce business actually fell 1% year over year, masked by a 13% increase in service revenue.To add salt to the wound, competitor PDD Holdings reported 94% top-line growth in the same quarter. Even Alibaba, which is facing its own challenges, reported 9% growth.JD.com is failing to keep up with the competition. It didn't help that previous CEO Xu Lei stepped down from his post in May 2023 after just one year, adding another layer of uncertainty to the company's future.The silver lining here is the fact the company is still profitable with a strong balance sheet. JD.com generated 39 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in free cash flow in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2023. It also had 242 billion yuan ($33.2 billion) in cash and short-term investments. With this solid financial position, JD.com can continue to invest in areas like live-streaming shopping, supply chain improvements, and other initiatives.Still, investors should be aware the path ahead remains challenging as it will have to outmaneuver rivals like Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and Douyin.So JD.com is at a crossroads. Despite its previous success, the future is far less certain now that it faces a more competitive industry and greater regulatory scrutiny.Given the recent bearish sentiment, JD.com stock trades at a significant discount to other e-commerce companies with a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is just 10.2, while Pinduoduo trades at 27.8 times earnings.Investors should monitor JD.com's rebound efforts in the coming quarters for clues of its progress. If the company can defend its position as a top three e-commerce platform in China and rekindle growth, its current stock price should prove to be a bargain.Should you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?Before you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JD.com wasn’t one of them.

3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now`"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is off to a great start in 2024. The e-commerce giant is making progress along all fronts of its multifaceted business, and its stock is up 66% over the past year.You might not realize that it's still trading below all-time highs. But the way things are going, Amazon stock is likely to surpass that in the coming months, and now is a great time to buy it.Here are three specific reasons to be confident about Amazon stock this year.Amazon made a strategic decision last year to restructure its distribution network from a national one to a regional one. The rationale was that the national network was large and cumbersome, making it take longer, on average, to get products to customers. A regional network stocked with high-selling items would get products to customers faster and at a lower cost.It now has eight regional distribution centers, and the results speak for themselves. In the 2023 fourth quarter, Amazon delivered 65% more items overnight than in the prior year. CEO Andy Jassy noted that as Amazon fulfills orders faster, customers choose it for more orders.In a first since 2018, Amazon has decreased its per-unit cost to fulfill globally, and in the U.S., fulfillment cost per unit decreased by more than $0.45 from last year. This allows Amazon to expand its selection profitably at lower average selling prices, improving its chances of gaining market share.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud services arm. Until recently, AWS sales were reliable to grow at rates around 35% in a typical quarter. That began to drop when inflation became severe, and client businesses started to cut their budgets.However, Amazon continues to lead the industry with 32% of the overall market according to Statista, and sales growth improved in the fourth quarter to 13% year over year. Jassy said the company is seeing larger deals accelerate; it announced several new deals with companies like Salesforce, BMW, and Nvidia.The company launched a robust suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services for AWS, and adoption rates are strong. The company offers three layers of AI to meet the varied needs of its clients, from the most customizable to partially customizable, with the top layer being a generative AI ""coded companion."" Last week, Amazon launched Rufus, a personal shopping generative AI application that takes customer queries and offers product recommendations based on requirements.Jassy said Amazon will continue to invest heavily in AI since it offers the opportunity to revolutionize the shopping and processing experience for its customers, and it sees this as a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years.Amazon only started to break out advertising as its own business segment in late 2021, when it grew 32% year over year, trailing AWS at 40%. With the other businesses slowing down, advertising has become the fastest-growing reporting segment, increasing 26% over last year in the 2023 fourth quarter. That was driven by sponsored ads.Advertising is a no-brainer for Amazon third-party sellers since it exposes them to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers. Amazon's top AI helps them target potential buyers with high accuracy.Amazon recently changed its streaming program to an ad-supported track, like Netflix and Walt Disney, which should pump up this segment even more. This will likely remain a strong business for Amazon in the near term, and as advertisers revisit their budgets after inflation-induced cuts, they're liable to spend more. Some percentage of that will go to Amazon.These are only part of the story. Amazon is making strides in smaller endeavors like cashierless stores, healthcare, and more. 2024 could be a banner year for Amazon, and in the long term, it's likely to add value to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks`"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 5 Stocks.Jim Cramer said in a latest program that after listening to the Fed chair Jerome Powell he believes we are at ""crossroads"" since there is still ""some inflation"" and the ""dichotomy"" of hard landing versus soft landing is being ""replaced by no landing."" Cramer said that we are ""back to reality"" and the reality, according to Cramer, is that interest rates are still ""not that high."" Cramer believes the rates are at a level where the economy can keep working. Cramer wondered how and why the Fed would cut interest rates when strong employment numbers keep coming and inflation is also not going down significantly.Jim Cramer tried to convince his viewers to invest in the stock market and said that while it would seem ""reckless"" to invest in the stock market because of the risks involved, it would be ""too late"" to invest in stocks once the Fed begins to cut interest rates. Jim Cramer said that stocks are in a win-win situation. If the economy keeps growing and the market remains strong, stocks will go up. If the economy begins to slow down, the Fed would cut rates sometime in the future, causing a rally in the stock market. Jim Cramer, however, acknowledged that stocks are risky when compared to the steady 5% income on CDs.Cramer said ""great"" stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can give you that ""5% from CDs"" in ""a week or even a day.""Cramer said that he has ""no illusions"" and he is convinced that now is the right time to buy stocks. Cramer said he thinks many investors would be inclined towards investing in low-risk index funds or parking their cash in CDs or treasuries but he thinks big money will be made by investing in individual stocks.But Jim Cramer is not bullish on all stocks. In fact over the past couple of years or so he's become quite selective in his choices and keeps recommending investors to sell or stay away from low-quality, money-losing or risky stocks and instead buy best of breed and high quality stocks.In this article we will talk about some stocks Cramer is bearish on.MethodologyFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to either stay away from or sell. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment where available. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/ASports and outdoor equipment company Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) recently went public in an IPO that fell short of expectations. Cramer had advised investors to stay away from the stock. He said:“So far, this is looking like another out of favor IPO, even if its lowball price allowed the stock to get a like, I guess you could call it a decent pop. And, I’ve got to tell you, Amer Sports is a great example of the kind of deals I wish we weren’t seeing.”One of the reasons why Cramer is bearish on Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) is the company's high exposure to China.While Cramer is bearish on the stock, Canadian billionaire Chip Wilson, who also founded Lululemon Athletica, bought $324 million worth of shares at the company’s IPO.While Cramer is bearish on companies like Amer Sports, he's recommending buying high-quality mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 9Last month, Jim Cramer was asked about Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC). Cramer recommended the questioner to ""take a pass"" on the stock. Cramer said the ""greatest inventor of our time"" Elon Musk does not like lithium companies and he is trying to figure out a way to cut our dependence on them. Cramer said he would not go against Musk.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Surgical facilities company Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on these days. When asked about Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) in a recent program on CNBC, Cramer said ""that industry is in up and down right now.""""I'm taking a hard pass,"" Cramer said of Surgery Partners.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The biggest stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is owned by Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $157 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22Jim Cramer in a recent program said he hasn’t ""liked Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) in 20 years, and it’s really rewarded my dislike.""Cramer said instead of Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) he's ""willing"" to recommend Verizon.Insider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 22 hedge funds had stakes in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD). The biggest stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) is owned by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP which owns a $37 million stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24Gene editing platform company CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) ranks sixth in our list of stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from.While Cramer said that he ""likes"" CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), the reason why he cannot recommend the stock is that CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) has been losing a lot of money. Cramer said he cannot recommend CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) stock on a ""fundamental basis.""The stock has gained about 17% over the past one year. Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) said the US FDA approved its groundbreaking gene editing therapy, Casgevy, developed with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) for those aged 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT).Unlike Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Cramer likes a lot, the CNBC host is bearish on CRSP.

3 Inspiring Underdogs That Fought Tech Giants and Won`"When it comes to success in emerging industries, size usually matters. Pioneers often fail, leaving behind the foundation for larger players to dominate. Thankfully for investors in mold-breaking upstarts, it doesn't always play out that way.Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Sonos (NASDAQ: SONO), and Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) are three companies that saw Apple and other consumer tech behemoths try to take them out. The little guys are not just surviving, but thriving against established titans with almost limitless resources. Take a bow Roku, Sonos, and Spotify.Roku founder Anthony Wood invented the digital video recorder, but it was another company that enjoyed the DVR glory. He got it right when he launched Roku a few years later, pioneering the streaming video revolution. It wasn't long before Roku was joined by some of the most valuable companies on the planet. Apple TV, Alphabet's Google Chromecast, and Amazon's Fire TV hit the market. Roku didn't flinch.Roku remains the leading operating system for smart TVs in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It has roughly double the market share of its closest rival. It doesn't matter that Google and Amazon are willing to practically give away the hardware to get folks connected. Roku has been able to sacrifice product margins, knowing it can make it up in volume.Roku is free to use, making the lion's share of its revenue from ad sharing and referrals. It's working. Average revenue per user is more than $41 over the past year. There are 75.8 million active accounts on the platform, and boy are they active. Roku users are spending an average of 3.8 hours a day streaming through the Roku hub.It doesn't seem possible. Roku is competing against Apple, a company that is used to getting people to pay a premium for its wares. Alphabet is the global leader in online advertising, putting it in the perfect position to cash in on an ad-supported industry. Amazon is the top dog in online retail, and it aggressively promotes its Fire TV dongles and smart TVs on its platform. Roku is still beating them all.Roku's enemies are also rivals of Sonos. It was 2005 when Sonos rolled out the first wireless multiroom speaker system, which streams audio seamlessly through a home. Audiophiles flocked to Sonos, but then familiar foes emerged. Apple, Amazon, and Google all had cheap smart speakers in support of their virtual assistant technologies. Sonos was in their crosshairs if they chose to go upmarket, but they missed.Sonos would go on to deliver 17 consecutive years of revenue growth before proving mortal in fiscal 2023. On Tuesday afternoon it posted financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. It was a well-received report.Revenue declined 9%, or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. It's not pretty, but analysts were bracing for a 13% decline. The bigger surprise is at the other end of the income statement. Profitability improved at Sonos, earning $0.64 a share for the seasonally potent holiday quarter, up from $0.57 a share a year earlier. Wall Street pros were settling for a sharp decline to $0.39 a share.""Despite the challenging environment, we are winning in the market and outperforming the competition,"" CEO Patrick Spence said in this week's earnings report.Rich in cash and patents, Sonos is well positioned to continue dominating its high-end niche. With analyst profit targets now likely headed higher, Sonos is cheap.Remember when everyone figured that Spotify was toast? The Swedish audio streaming service was making waves worldwide, but would it be able to succeed in the U.S. as Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Amazon Music flooded the market? It's doing pretty well, even if it had to go through three rounds of layoffs last year.There are 602 million mostly ad-supported monthly active users, a 23% increase over the past year. Getting folks to pay is the more difficult nut to crack, but Spotify has been beefing up its catalog of original content to go with its industry-leading music platform. Premium Spotify accounts have risen 15% over the past year to reach 236 million.Apple and Amazon are distant competitors. Google Play Music threw in the towel, handing its digital ambitions over to YouTube Music. It's going to be hard for the other streaming service stocks to catch up to Spotify now.Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

How Twitter's descent into chaos is paving the way for a new web`"The post-Twitter era has spurred the development and further growth of numerous social networks that prioritize brief posts, from open source standbys like Mastodon to new decentralized concepts like Bluesky, and those from smaller startups like Post, Spill, and Spoutible, to those from tech giants like Meta, which launched the Twitter-like Threads. While this is great news for people looking for a new place to land after Twitter's demise (the network under Elon Musk is now called X and headed in a different direction), it's a challenge for early adopters who want to experiment with new apps and services.Not everyone is satisfied with X's current course. Though a top-ranked app today, it's not the Twitter of years past. X takes a lax approach to content moderation, leaving advertisers and some users in search of new options. Even its owner dabbles in antisemitism and trolling, prompting more of the same from the user base. As top advertisers fled, X's ads became worse and more spammy.Elon Musk says ‘go f*ck yourself’ to advertisers leaving XThe changes at X have been swift and troublesome, leading to a flurry of activity in the social sphere as X alternatives emerged. But now there's too much of a good thing.The Twitter diaspora, so to speak, is hungry for a solution to save them from having to browse content from across half a dozen apps, in addition to the news websites, blogs, and other information sources they already consume while online.That problem is now being addressed by another group of developers -- those who aren't trying to re-create Twitter or improve upon it, but solve the problem of there being ""too many Twitters"" to keep up with.Last week, we reported on Tapestry, a new project from The Iconfactory, the app development shop best known for its work on the early Twitter client Twitterrific. Recently funded on Kickstarter after only showing off its prototype build, Tapestry aims to offer a unified app for tracking social media, news, and RSS feeds in one place. That includes posts from X, Bluesky, Mastodon, Tumblr, and others in the future, like perhaps Threads.The Iconfactory was only looking to raise $100,000 to start development of the new app. It was fully funded as of February 5 and has since exceeded that, which allows it to now chase stretch goals of $150,000 and up, which would fund additional features for the app, like muting, filtering, search, bookmarking, and more.Image Credits: The IconfactoryThe Iconfactory isn't the only developer who has seized on this moment to develop a new multi-service social app.The developer behind the popular Mac and iOS newsreader app Reeder, Silvio Rizzi, is now working on something of a Reeder replacement. Though Rizzi says Reeder will continue to be supported, the new project aims to offer more than just news feeds. In an announcement on Mastodon last week, the developer teased plans for an app that's ""not just an RSS reader,"" but instead a tool that would allow you to access content from across sources, like ""podcasts, YouTube, Mastodon, and more,"" he said.The app is expected to launch into public beta later this spring on Mac, iPhone, and iPad. (A screenshot of the app concept Rizzi posted offered a nod to Tapestry, as both projects emerged around the same time.)Image Credits: Silvio RizziMeanwhile, Tapbots, the makers of Mastodon client Ivory (and previously the Twitter app Tweetbot on which it's based), is weighing how to approach the growing number of social networks available to users. There is no single Twitter alternative, so deciding where to focus limited developer resources is key.According to Tapbots co-founder Paul Haddad, the company hasn't yet decided whether it will support Bluesky yet, but says they are thinking about it.""We’ve got our next few months pretty booked with Ivory/Mastodon features and of course are committed to the Fediverse long-term,"" he told TechCrunch, referring to the decentralized social web powered by the ActivityPub protocol. ""We do plan to take a look at Bluesky sometime after that.""However, if Tapbots chooses to support Bluesky, it may or may not be part of the Ivory app, he added.Other services are focused on the needs of power users and creators to cross-post to multiple networks at once. This includes scheduling tools like those from fedica and Postpone, as well as consumer apps like Yup. The latter offers a solution for posting to X, Bluesky, Farcaster, Lens, and Threads, though it lacks access to a Threads developer API, requiring users to disable Instagram’s two-factor authentication (2FA) to get it to work. (We do NOT recommend this.)Image Credits: YupSimilarly, an app from a Japanese developer, Sora, offers access to Mastodon, Bluesky, and the federated networks Misskey and Firefish.Then there are the various web3, blockchain-based networks, and protocols, like Farcaster and Lens, as well as other decentralized protocols that are fostering networks of their own, like Nostr (favored by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey these days). There's also the decentralized network Matrix, which offers multiple cross-platform clients.Even Reddit has inspired decentralized alternatives, like Lemmy, /kbin, and other smaller projects.Because not all the decentralized networks talk to each other, bridges between protocols are also being built, like those that connect Matrix to Nostr or Mastodon to Bluesky, among others.Quipped Columbia Journalism Review journalist and longtime tech early adopter Mathew Ingram in a post on Threads, ""We need a FriendFeed for the 2000s.""His reference recalls a former era of social networking plenty, Web 2.0, when users turned to a social networking aggregator co-founded by then-former Googlers Bret Taylor (former Salesforce Co-CEO), Gmail creator Paul Buchheit, Jim Norris, and Sanjeev Singh. FriendFeed brought together social networking websites, bookmarking sites, websites, blogs, and microblogs into one place -- something that's again in demand today following the explosion of Twitter alternatives and decentralized services.Of course, Facebook eventually acquired FriendFeed and began to dominate social media, shutting out even well-resourced competitors like Google+. Now known as Meta, the social networking giant remains unbeaten, with nearly 3.2 billion users across its family of apps. But in its rush to adopt the ActivityPub protocol in its new app Threads, also used by Mastodon, there's a hint of concern. It suggests that even Meta believes the tide could possibly turn against it, as users embrace these alternative social platforms.For some smaller apps, the decision is whether to try to compete with the growing number of alternatives or join them. For instance, the Twitter competitor, Spoutible, founded by Christopher Bouzy, the developer of a Twitter analytics service previously, announced in December that his network would ""soon"" integrate with Mastodon for cross-posting and later, Threads.""Users being able to post across various platforms positions Spoutible not just as a social media platform but as a versatile tool designed to streamline your digital communication,"" he wrote, after it was clear Spoutible was not among those favored to win the competition to be the new Twitter.Unfortunately for people in hopes of a simple cross-posting solution, Spoutible this month faced security issues when it was revealed the API had a serious vulnerability that could allow hackers to take control of user accounts. The API even returned users' 2FA (two-factor authentication) code and the reset tokens that helped users change passwords. That puts Spoutible's cross-posting plans on the back burner for the time being, if not its future altogether.Another Web 2.0 survivor, Flipboard, also recently decided integration was the best path forward. It ditched Twitter and integrated with Mastodon while rebuilding its backend to join the fediverse -- the decentralized social web. The social magazine app also became the first app to support Bluesky, Mastodon, and Pixelfed (a decentralized Instagram alternative) last May, allowing users to track updates across these social networks, as well as YouTube, all in one place.Image Credits: FlipboardAnother platform, micro.blog, is looking to address the cross-posting needs from a different angle: as the blog host. Instead of creating content directly on social platforms, users could publish to micro.blog, follow other bloggers, and engage in conversations, while also still cross-posting to more popular platforms including Mastodon, Medium, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Flickr, Bluesky, Nostr, and Pixelfed. (The Iconfactory said its forthcoming app Tapestry would also support micro.blog).Elsewhere, publishing giant WordPress acquired an ActivityPub plugin to allow WordPress blogs to join the fediverse. Newsletter platform Substack created a short-form ""Notes"" feed that resembled Twitter. Artifact, the aggregator from Instagram's co-founders, eventually pivoted to cloning Twitter before shutting down.In short, a lot is going on in the social web today. And this is by no means a definitive list of those companies and developers attacking the problem -- or adding to it. Unnamed are, of course, the wide variety of open source and smaller projects in the works, too, as is common when open APIs are available.Whether this explosion of new social networks is a temporary problem or a new state of being remains to be seen. Likely, some of the smaller ""Twitter-alts"" will eventually die off, after failing to gain traction, or will fold into the wider fediverse, as the would-be Twitter rival Pebble (formerly T2) did last year.But it's also possible that we're witnessing the rebuilding of the web in real time. One where there are many protocols, many platforms, and many ways to connect not just people, but also their media, and their ideas, along with links to websites, news, and blogs.Aggregators like Tapestry may be an initial step to figuring out how to navigate this new web, but it also calls out for a way to search it too: a new Google of sorts that plugs into all the activity now taking place beyond websites, including the information that's shared through these novel social networks across new protocols. And who is building that?Twitterrific’s team is back with Tapestry, an app for tracking social media, news, RSS and moreAs Bluesky opens to the public, CEO Jay Graber faces her biggest challenge yetThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/07/how-twitters-descent-into-chaos-is-paving-the-way-for-a-new-web/Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:43:55.594040`META
Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Magnificent 7 ETFs Rise on Blockbuster Earnings`"The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Tesla TSLA, now account for almost 30% of the S&P 500 index. They were responsible for more than 62% of the S&P 500’s total return in 2023.Most experts anticipated a broadening of the market rally in 2024; however, market leadership has narrowed further this year. These stocks have driven more than 80% of the index's rise.All these companies benefited from the AI hype in 2023, but we've seen divergent performances in 2024 as investors assess which will emerge as the biggest beneficiaries of the forthcoming AI boom.Nvidia and Meta are leading the group, while Tesla significantly lags. This divergence has expanded in the past few weeks, as all but one reported their financial results. Meta's results were particularly well-received, sending the shares of the social media giant up more than 20%.Tesla has been punished for missing both earnings and revenue estimates. The EV giant’s earnings were down almost 46% amid weakening margins. The stock has lost 26% of its value this year.While NVIDIA is yet to announce its results, its stock has already appreciated by 42% in 2024, following a 240% increase in 2023, as most other giants disclosed aggressive AI investments.The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS provides equal weight exposure to these stocks.

Meta challenges supervisory fee for EU online content rules`"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Meta Platforms has challenged a supervisory fee amounting to 0.05% of its annual worldwide net income aimed at covering EU regulators' costs of monitoring compliance with new European Union rules requiring it to do more to police content.The European Commission has said the Digital Services Act (DSA) levy applies to 20 very large online platforms, including Meta, Google, Apple and TikTok and two very large online search engines.The size of the annual fee is related to the number of average monthly active users for each company and whether it posts a profit or loss in the preceding financial year.Meta said it disagreed with the methodology used to calculate the fees.""Currently, companies that record a loss don't have to pay, even if they have a large user base or represent a greater regulatory burden, which means some companies pay nothing, leaving others to pay a disproportionate amount of the total,"" a Meta spokesperson said.The company has challenged the levy at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest. Politico was the first to report about Meta's move.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by David Gregorio)Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:43:55.594040`META
Meta accused of not taking Facebook Marketplace fraud seriously`Meta has been accused by MPs of not taking the problem of online fraud on its platforms seriously.The parent company of Facebook and Instagram came under scrutiny from the Home Affairs Select Committee after representatives from the banking sector said the “majority” of scams they see start on Meta platforms.Paul Davis, financial crime prevention director at TSB, told the committee that Facebook Marketplace is the “main place” where purchase scams originate, which, along with investment and impersonation scams, are the most common types of fraud affecting bank customers.“For those three types, which as I say are the main ones, we see about 80% start on social media,” Mr Davis told MPs.“Indeed, let’s not walk past the fact that, when I say social media there, the majority of them start from the channels owned by one company in particular, which is Meta.”🗣️We are now live and questioning banks and big tech firms on how they protect people from fraud. We are hearing from:@TSB@RevolutApp@santanderuk@Meta@BTGroup@Microsoft📺Watch here: https://t.co/tzoMPErfmQ pic.twitter.com/W9vtl7DRJe— Home Affairs Committee (@CommonsHomeAffs) February 7, 2024He added: “Facebook Marketplace doesn’t have a payments channel attached to it, it’s not like a website you might use to buy something off a high street shop, for example, or Amazon. So, you have to get bank details from the seller of that item.“What we see are customers telling us that they get bank details from the seller, send them money and then the item never turns up.”In response, Philip Milton, public policy manager for fraud at Meta, told the committee that the tech giant takes the issue “extremely seriously”.When suggested by the committee that evidence given to MPs by the banks shows Meta is not doing all it can to prevent online fraud, Mr Milton said: “I disagree with that.”He went on: “To give you an idea of the scale that we’re putting in place to tackle this kind of thing, since 2016 we’ve invested 20 billion dollars on safety and security, and that’s not slowing down – five billion of that was in the last year alone.“We have 40,000 people working across the company on safety and security. Half of that number are involved in directly reviewing content, so we invest significantly in trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening.”He added that fraud “fundamentally undermines the experience we’re trying to provide for people” and said this, combined with fraudulent advertising affecting trust in the company from advertisers and its wider reputation, means the firm is “directly incentivised” to do all it can to prevent criminal activity.However, committee member Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, argued that the five billion dollars Meta said it spent last year on safety and security equates to less than 4% of the firm’s annual revenue for the year – a figure he suggested is “not very high”.Mr Loughton also questioned whether the 20,000 people reviewing content for Meta is an adequate number given the site has “four billion active accounts”, and suggested the social media giant is not taking the issue “terribly seriously” because, as Facebook Marketplace does not have a payments channel linked to it, the site is not financially liable if fraud takes place there.“You apparently have no financial skin in the game for clamping down on fraud on Facebook Marketplace other than potential reputational damage,” he said.“Unless there’s a clear link with advertisers walking away with their revenue because they’re concerned at (banking sector research showing) 80% of fraud starting on (social media platforms) and 68% of it specifically your platforms, then you don’t really have to take it terribly seriously – and the fact you’re spending five billion dollars out of an annual revenue of 134.9 billion, which, as I say, is three and a bit percent for a people-based service, is tiny.“So you’re not taking this problem seriously, are you?”In response, Mr Milton said: “I don’t agree with that at all”, and argued that “the scale of our investment demonstrates how seriously we take this problem”, adding that it is “market-leading” levels of funding for safety and security.He added that, in response to tactics from fraudsters who demand payment or ask for an item to be sent before it is paid for, Meta has “removed the ability to ship an item on Facebook Marketplace”, and that there is “no way to pay for an item” on the platform because the firm is trying to “design out” the ability for criminals to use the platform for fraud.Related Quotes`2024-02-08 00:43:55.594040`META
Germany forced to slash DHL stake by €2.2bn to fix railways`Germany has been forced to sell off some of its stake in package deliverer DHL as it struggles to improve the country’s rail network amid a budget crisis.The KfW bank, which holds the government’s remaining stakes in previously state-held companies, said it has sold 50 million shares of Deutsche Post, the name under which it still trades on the stock exchange.The €2.2bn (£1.9bn) sale, at €43.45 each, cuts the German state’s share in the company by 4pc to 16.5pc.Germany’s finance ministry said the money would be used to strengthen the capital of Germany’s main railway operator, the state-owned Deutsche Bahn, and to improve railway infrastructure.The government has been forced to turn to share sales to help finance improvements to the rail network after a court ruling forced it to plug a big hole in this year’s budget and reconsider its wider financial plans.In November, Germany’s highest court annulled a decision made by the government in 2022 to repurpose €60bn originally meant to cushion the fallout from the pandemic for measures to help combat climate change and modernise the country.Read the latest updates below.Thanks for joining us today. My colleague Chris Price will be back in the morning, reporting on the latest company news as the London markets open.Brussels has waved through new rules that will force derivative traders to clear deals through the European Union, dealing the latest blow to the City. Our reporter Adam Mawardi has the details:London could lose control of its lucrative clearing market after EU officials backed proposals to shift more business activity to operators across the bloc.The provisional rules require banks and asset managers above a certain threshold to clear derivative contracts, such as euro interest rate swaps, through accounts with EU-based clearing houses.Vincent Van Peteghem, Belgium’s finance minister who helped negotiate the agreement with the European Parliament, said: “This will bring more clearing services to Europe and enhance our strategic autonomy.”Clearing houses serve as middlemen between buyers and sellers for financial assets and ensure deals go through even when counterparties default.They have become a crucial part of the banking system following the 2008 financial crisis which exposed the risks around derivative trading.The controversial change is designed to make EU clearing houses more attractive, effectively ending Europe’s reliance on UK-based rivals following Brexit.Read the full report...The sovereign wealth fund behind McLaren is seeking to bring in new investors to help fund the British carmaker’s growth, according to a report.McLaren’s controlling shareholder, Mumtalakat of Bahrain, is looking to raise additional investment to develop McLaren’s technology and enter new markets.

McLaren declined to comment.Ryanair is concerned by shortcomings identified by US regulators in a report into the Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 accident, the airline’s chief Michael O’Leary said on Wednesday.A door plug that flew off an Alaska Airlines MAX 9 jet mid-flight on Jan 5 appeared to be missing four key bolts, according to a preliminary report by the US National Transportation Safety Board released on Tuesday.Michael O’Leary said today:I think we’re concerned because it highlights, you know, poor production quality with Boeing. .. but we don’t think it affects our Boeing 737 fleet or the Max 8 that we operate.Ryanair, which is Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers and one of Boeing’s main customers, has ordered over 350 Max jets in recent years, but has no Max 9 aircraft.He said the last 12 aircraft Ryanair received in October-December showed quality improvements from earlier in the year, “but Boeing have clearly more to do”.He added:There’s no doubt that the increased supervision by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) in Seattle will slow things down. We’re just not sure yet whether it will affect our deliveries between now and the end of June.Boeing told The Telegraph:Ryanair is a valued customer and we are working closely with them to address their concerns. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to improve our quality and delivery performance and will support our customers every step of the way.Rishi Sunak must slash Britain’s benefits bill instead of relying on immigration if he wants to get the country’s debts under control, according to an official at the UK’s budget watchdog. Szu Ping Chan reports:Rishi Sunak must slash Britain’s benefits bill instead of relying on immigration if he wants to get the country’s debts under control, according to an official at the UK’s budget watchdog.David Miles, an executive member of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said waves of new migrants would not solve Britain’s fiscal crisis and were likely to add to pressure on public services.The former Bank of England rate-setter added that a migrant-driven upgrade to the UK’s population projections may not provide a long-term boost to the public finances. It came as analysis by Bloomberg suggested that rising migrant numbers could hand Jeremy Hunt £18bn for tax cuts next month by boosting the economy.Writing for the Telegraph, Mr Miles described welfare reforms that encouraged more people back to work as “unambiguously beneficial” for tax revenues, adding that a drive to get increase employment was “particularly great” for younger people suffering from mental health issues.By contrast, the Imperial College professor said it was “much less clear that persistently high levels of net immigration to boost the labour force can generate sustained fiscal improvements”, suggesting that relying on public investment or a sharp rise in productivity were also unlikely to bear fruit.Read the full report...Luxury online store Farfetch has been dealt a fresh blow as the owner of Bergdorf Goodman moved to end a partnership deal struck two years ago.The Telegraph understands that Neiman Marcus Group is pulling a tie-up with the British fashion retailer, which last month collapsed and was rescued by South Korea’s Coupang.Under the deal which was agreed in early 2022, Farfetch and Neiman Marcus had been working on improving the Bergdorf Goodman website and mobile app. Bergdorf Goodman is a well-known luxury US department store which has featured in shows including Gossip Girl.Farfetch also agreed to take a minority stake in Neiman Marcus under the 2022 agreement, investing $200m (£158m) into the business. It is understood to still hold this position.The end of the partnership comes in the wake of Coupang’s swoop on Farfetch, which saw the South Korean company buy the British fashion firm in a rescue deal after its value collapsed 99pc.The deal wiped out shareholders and many of the company’s bondholders.Bondholders have since demanded an investigation into the conduct of José Neves, the co-founder and chief executive of Farfetch.A spokesman for Neiman Marcus said the group had “decided to end its commercial partnership with Farfetch”.They added: “The Bergdorf Goodman website and app will continue to serve as the luxury ecommerce destination for its customers and will no longer be re-platforming onto Farfetch Platform Solutions... We appreciate Farfetch, which continues to be a minority investor in NMG.”A spokesperson for Farfetch said: “We continue to partner closely with thousands of brands and boutiques around the world to provide an elevated online luxury experience for millions of customers.”The FTSE 100 closed down 0.68pc.

Carex owner PZ Cussons was the biggest faller, down 16.41pc, followed by defence company Babcock, down 8.93pcJohn Condon writes:China used to make cheap knock offs. No longer: their products are now typically on a par with German quality but at significantly lower prices. I remember being in Chongqing [in southwestern China] where the Germans built the first line on the metro system - trains, track escalators etc etc. There are now over 10 lines all built with no German input - but to the same standard. This isn’t new. It is exactly what the Japanese and South Koreans did.So Germany is losing its export markets.Mike Doe says:It remains an unfathomable mystery why Europe, and in particular Germany, has chosen to sacrifice its automotive industry and its associated jobs on the altar of net zero to benefit the Chinese Communist Party.Robert Young writes:So Germany forced into fire sale of state assets to fund its crumbling railway and road infrastructure! The glory days of the German economy are now well and truly over as it collapses into deep recession and gloom.Rob Houghton comments on the high price of German exports:German products, and especially cars, are now hugely expensive to buy. I suspect the Chinese are going to fill the gap.Joshua Tamworth says:Isn’t it strange that the elite always forecast the German economy more positively than actuals, and the UK more negatively than actuals.For something like 20 quarters in a row.You’d conclude that there’s conscious and unconscious bias towards the EU, and its positive impact on the economy.Italy’s government will offer targeted tax breaks to help farmers facing hardship, a minister told the Italian parliament on Wednesday, amid a wave of protests across continental Europe.Farmers have staged demonstrations to express their anger about low prices for produce, rising costs, cheap imports and burdens imposed by the EU’s climate change policies.The protests have eased in France and Germany for now but appear to be growing in intensity in countries such as Spain and Italy, where groups of farmers have congregated outside Rome with their tractors.The Italian government appears set to partially restore an income tax break which had been dropped in the budget law for 2024, accepting one of the farmers’ key requests.“A measure aimed at providing tax exemption for those agricultural entrepreneurs who need effective support ... is being studied,” Italian minister Luca Ciriani said.“It is clear that the main priority for this government in managing public resources is to use them to support the weakest,” added Mr Ciriani, a member of Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party.He said the tax breaks could be included in a government decree currently being examined in parliament.The US carmaker is moving away from expensive models to lure mainstream drivers, writes Melissa Lawford:Ford is to launch a range of cheap electric vehicles as it seeks to compete with Chinese manufacturers and Tesla.The US carmaker’s chief executive Jim Farley on Tuesday announced plans to move away from big, expensive electric vehicles (EVs) to lower cost models that will convince mainstream car buyers to go electric, after years of secret development in a so-called skunkworks hived off from the main business.High prices are the biggest factor holding back everyday consumers from purchasing EVs over petrol vehicles, Mr Farley said.Speaking to analysts on a conference call, he said Ford had “made a bet in silence two years ago” to start developing cheap EVs.Mr Farley said: “We’re also adjusting our capital, switching more focus onto smaller EV products.Read on to find out what Ford management is “ruthlessly focused” on...Britain’s top technology firm, Arm Holdings, is issuing its quarterly results this evening - the second since it floated in New York.The chip designer makes money by licensing designs that others manufacture, and its technology is used in electronics from companies including Apple and Samsung.The company is expected to do well from demand for artificial intelligence services, with companies such as Microsoft attracted to the energy efficiency offered by Arm processors.Sara Russo, an analyst at brokers Sanford C. Bernstein, said:We expect positive long-term value commentary around Arm-based servers and laptops, but continue to believe we will have to wait for full-year 2025 for any significant recovery in royalty rates.Arm shares are up 2.1pc in trading today.The US trade deficit narrowed in 2023 to the smallest in three years, American government data showed Wednesday, while the country imported more goods from Mexico than China for the first time in about two decades.The latest figures add to a series of positive economic news for President Joe Biden, who has been working to boost sentiment on his handling of the economy as his November reelection campaign picks up pace.For all of 2023, the overall trade gap was $773.4bn, down 18.7 percent from the $951.2bn figure in the prior year, US Commerce Department figures showed.In 2022, the country saw the biggest deficit in government data dating back to 1960.But the latest numbers showed a fall in the goods deficit last year, with imports of products dropping more than exports.Purchases of supplies like crude oil and fuel oil fell, while Americans bought less consumer goods like clothing and cell phones as well.This was partly due to the unravelling of consumption patterns during the Covid-19 pandemic, during which people cooped up at home spent on items including electronics as they worked remotely.Meanwhile, exports of services increased last year, particularly in the travel sector, and the services surplus widened.Surprisingly resilient consumption last year has helped to support the US economy, but analysts expect higher interest rates to slow consumer spending and add pressure on imports.Shares in Snap, the company behind the social media app Snapchat, have plunged 34pc today after it released disappointing results and gave an uninspiring forecast for 2024.The stock market reaction wiped $958m off chief executive Evan Spiegel’s stake in the firm.In the final quarter of 2023, revenue rose 5pc to $1.36bn in the fourth quarter of 2023, missing the $1.38bn average of analysts’ estimates and disappointing investors after strong results for the quarter from Facebook owner Meta.The company continued to lose money, posting a loss of $1.3bn, although this was at a slightly lower level than in 2023.The company is continuing to forecast losses this year, with revenue growing by 11pc to 15pc.The company pre-empted the results by announcing on Monday that it would lay off about 10pc of its workforce, amounting to about 500 employees.Mr Spiegel said: “2023 was a pivotal year for Snap, as we transformed our advertising business and continued to expand our global community, reaching 414 million daily active users.“Snapchat enhances relationships with friends, family, and the world, and this unique value proposition has provided a strong foundation to build our business for long-term growth.”That’s all from me today. My colleague Alex Singleton will keep you furnished with the latest essential updates.The boss of Sainsbury’s has refused to rule out job losses under plans to slash costs by £1bn as the chain revealed it will cut general merchandise and clothing space and expand its food offering.The UK’s second biggest supermarket unveiled a strategy update that will see it boost food space across all its near-600 supermarkets, while focusing expansion efforts on 180 of its “highest potential” sites, which will see about 10pc more space dedicated to food.But it will also cut its general merchandise and clothing offering across many shops, with between 20pc to 30pc less store space for non-food ranges in the 180 shops.The retailer suggested jobs may be in the firing line, as it said it would cut costs by £1bn over the next three years, while investing in technology and artificial intelligence (AI).Chief executive Simon Roberts refused to rule out job losses as the group plans to use AI to increase automation.He said the group would look to “protect jobs as much as possible” by being flexible and to “re-skill” and “re-deploy where we can”.Our retail editor Hannah Boland has the

closer to wrenching control over euro clearing back from London today after reaching a key political agreement on new clearing rules.Our reporter Michael Bow has the latest:Officials from the EU Council and the EU Parliament backed a package of measures from the European Commission forcing banks clearing euro-derivatives trading to send a minimum portion of trades through EU-based institutions.The plan is designed to reduce reliance on London as a clearing centre post-Brexit.Despite broad support in Brussels, the proposals lack specific demands on the amount of clearing needed to be provided inside the EU.More than 90pc of euro-denominated clearing is done at London’s LCH, prompting fears in Brussels about a lack of oversight from the EU.UK and EU officials are still debating rules over equivalence, which allow the UK to clear euro-denominated contracts.Carlsberg has plunged to a £4.7bn loss after the Kremlin commandeered its Russian business.Our senior business reporter Daniel Woolfson has the details:Carlsberg’s Russian business unit, Baltika Breweries, was seized by Russian authorities last year after the Danish brewer tried to sell it and exit the country.The brewer said on Tuesday that the incident resulted in the company making a loss of 40.8bn Danish krone (£4.7bn) for the year.Carlsberg employed around 8,400 people in Russia prior to the seizure, and had been looking to sell the business amid pressure on consumer brands to leave Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.Read how the seizure of Carlsberg’s Russian business comes amid a

lower-than-expected sales revenue for the last quarter of 2023.Alibaba posted a 5pc increase in sales to 260.3bn yuan (£29bn) for the three months to December, slightly missing analyst estimates.Net income sank to 14.4bn yuan (£1.6bn), down 77pc compared to the same time last year.The Hangzhou-based business attributed the drastic drop in net income to the decrease in value of its equity investments and a decrease in income from operations due to that.Alibaba’s New York-listed stock price fell about 4pc in premarket trading following the report.Alibaba chief executive Eddie Wu said: “Our top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing.”Electric cars cannot be advertised as completely “zero emission” because of the carbon dioxide that is generated when they are made and charged, the advertising watchdog has declared.Our industry editor Matt Oliver has the details:In a ruling that will change how electric vehicles (EVs) are promoted, the Advertising Standards Authority has banned carmakers from referring to them as zero emission unless they make clear this is only while driving.The decision emerged as the regulator criticised BMW for describing its range of EVs as “zero emission cars” in Google searches.In the ruling, the ASA said: “We understood that when electric vehicles were driven no emissions were produced, unlike a car with a petrol or diesel engine where emissions came from the tailpipe.“However, in other circumstances, such as the manufacture or charging of an electric vehicle using electricity from the national grid, emissions were generated.”The ruling comes as demand for electric cars has waned.When was the last time you had a Breakaway bar? For many of you, the answer is “I have no idea” or “a very long time ago” and that is the way it is likely to stay forever.The Breakaway and Yorkie biscuit bars are to disappear from shelves following a decline in sales, maker Nestle has announced.The Yorkie Biscuit is not to be confused with Yorkie chocolate bars, which Nestle said are “staying for good”.Nestle said the chocolate-covered Breakaway will no longer be produced from March, to make way for new products.Breakaway fans can still buy the bar throughout February and March at Sainsbury’s while stocks last.The Breakaway, made with wholemeal, oat and coconut flours, was launched in 1970 by Rowntree Mackintosh before being acquired by Nestle in 1988.It follows Nestle blaming falling sales on its decision in November to discontinue the Caramac bar after 64 years.US stock indexes were subdued in premarket trading as investors grapple with uncertainty about the outlook for interest rate cuts.Ford jumped 6pc in premarket trading after the car maker increased its first-quarter dividend and decided to scale back investments in new capacity for loss-making electric vehicles. General Motors also added 1.4pc.On the flip side, Snap slumped 32.3pc after missing quarterly revenue estimates, as the Snapchat-owner struggled to compete for advertising dollars against heavyweights such as Meta and Alphabet. Peer Pinterest shed 3.8pc.Uber announced its first full-year operating profit and forecast quarterly core profit and gross bookings above estimates. However, its shares were last down 1.7pc ahead of the opening bell.Wall Street has been relatively quiet this week following a stellar performance in the months before which saw the benchmark S&P 500 hit record highs.In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc, the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq 100 was up 0.1pc.Uber secured its first full-year operating profit as its number of bookings jumped in the run-up to Christmas in what its boss said was a “standout quarter to cap off a standout year”.Operating income swung from a loss of $1.8bn (£1.4bn) to a profit of $1.1bn (£870m).Gross bookings - which includes deliver orders, ride hailing and driver earnings - grew 22pc to $37.6bn (£29.8bn) in the final three months of 2023.The number of trips and monthly active platform consumers grew 24pc and 15pc, respectively, compared to the same period the previous year.Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said:2023 was an inflection point for Uber, proving that we can continue to generate strong, profitable growth at scale.Our audiences are larger and more engaged than ever, with our platform powering an average of nearly 26 million daily trips last year.The German economy is already threatened by recession after output shrank 0.3pc in the final three months of last year.Our economics editor Szu Ping Chan analyses the backdrop for Europe’s largest economy:Analysts believe the German economy could shrink again in the current quarter as ailing manufacturers struggle to adapt to a world without cheap Russian energy after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.Stefan Schilbe, HSBC’s chief German economist, said there was “little hope for a change in trend” in the coming months.He added: “Nationwide strikes by rail and airport workers are likely to weigh on output in January and February. In addition, the global economic climate remains subdued, coupled with high geopolitical risks amid the situation in the Red Sea, high interest rates, and domestic energy prices still well above their pre-pandemic level. So German manufacturers face more of the same weakness at the beginning of this year.”The country is also struggling to deal with a property crisis driven by plunging prices and a collapse in building activity.Analysts highlighted that car production was bouncing back, though Carsten Brzeski at ING said an ongoing decline in energy-intensive production “could lengthen the process of bottoming out”.Mr Brzeski said: “Germany wouldn’t be Germany these days if there weren’t new problems weighing on the short-term outlook: strikes and supply chain disruptions as a result of the military conflict in the Red Sea have made another contraction in the German economy in the first quarter of the year even more likely.”Oil prices have edged higher after a two-day gain amid the geopolitical risk in the Middle East - and some analysts think prices could be about to shift higher.Brent crude was last up 0.6pc to tip above $79 a barrel after climbing 1.6pc over the previous two sessions, while West Texas Intermediate was up 0.6pc to just under $74.Houthi rebels said they targeted two ships in the southern Red Sea, the latest in a string of attacks that has forced a major re-routing of global trade. The US has vowed more strikes against Iranian forces and their proxies in the region.However, the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute has kept a lid on price rises for now after it said US nationwide crude inventories rose 674,000 barrels last week.Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at Swedish bank SEB, said signs of a revival in the global economy will eventually push prices higher as Saudi Arabia decides against increasing production. He said:With emerging signs of a global revival, it is very unlikely that Saudi/OPEC+ will cave in and switch from “price over volume” to “volume over price”.A potential revival implies a stronger demand impulse down the road.And if you look upon the world economy with the eyes of an optimist your take would probably be: Chinese policy has shifted focus to growth, Biden’ infrastructure stimulus package is stimulating the economy significantly, the EU is crawling out of the woods as natural gas prices have come down, India marches on, inflation globally is fading and interest rate cuts are coming.Philip Milton, public policy manager for fraud at Meta, told the Home Affairs Select Committee that the tech giant took the issue of fraud on the platform “extremely seriously”.Responding to evidence from the banking sector about large-scale fraud occurring on Facebook Marketplace, Mr Milton said fraud “fundamentally undermines the experience we’re trying to provide for people” and said this, combined with fraudulent advertising impacting trust in the company from advertisers, meant the tech giant was “directly incentivised” to do all it can to prevent criminal activity.When suggested by the committee that the evidence to MPs from the banks showed Meta was not doing all it could to prevent online fraud, Mr Milton said:I disagree with that. To give you an idea of the scale that we’re putting in place to tackle this kind of thing, since 2016 we’ve invested 20 billion dollars on safety and security, and that’s not slowing down - five billion of that was in the last year alone.We have 40,000 people working across the company on safety and security. Half of that number are involved in directly reviewing content, so we invest significantly in trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening.A quick look at the energy markets, where wholesale gas prices remain subdued as mild winter weather reduces demand for heating.Europe’s benchmark contract fell as much as 2.6pc today and was last down 0.2pc to less than €29 per megawatt hour.Prices have fallen more than 30pc since October as temperatures remained above usual levels, keeping already extra-full storage sites well stocked.The UK equivalent contract was down 0.7pc, having fallen as much as 3.2pc in early trading.The pound has risen against the dollar as the latest figures showed house prices in Britain rose at their fastest annual pace in a year - supporting bets that the Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates soon.Sterling was up 0.3pc to $1.26 as property values jumped for the fourth month in a row, according to Halifax.The pound was also up 0.2pc against the euro, which is worth 85p, as Bank of England policymaker Sarah Breeden said the next few months were “incredibly important” in assessing the impact of wages on inflation.Tumbling inflation and slowing pay growth could open the way to lower interest rates in the coming months, the Bank of England’s newest monetary policymaker has hinted.Our deputy economics editor Tim Wallace has the latest:Sarah Breeden, who joined the Monetary Policy Committee in November, said last year’s worries over the persistence of inflation have started to fade.In December “the question I was focused on was whether there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures which might mean we needed to tighten further,” she said.“As I have become more confident that persistence is likely to evolve as embodied within our forecast, I have become less concerned that rates might need to be tightened further. Instead my focus, and indeed the focus of many on the MPC, has shifted to thinking about how long rates need to remain at their current level.”Inflation stood at 4pc in December, lower than the Bank of England predicted but still twice its 2pc target.Ms Breeden said she will look for more evidence on wages and inflation before moving interest rates from their current level of 5.25pc.“The next few months will be incredibly important for my assessment of wage and price persistence, with the majority of this year’s wage setting processes set to conclude by April,” she said.Eight in 10 of the most commons financial frauds faced by consumers begin on social media, MPs have been told.Paul Davis, financial crime prevention director at TSB, told the Home Affairs Committee:The three main types of fraud that impact our customers are purchase scams, they’re the most common, although they tend to be lower value; investment scams, which are a bit less common but tend to be very high value; and impersonation scams.For those three types, which as I say are the main ones, we see about 80pc start on social media.Indeed, let’s not walk past the fact that when I say social media there, the majority of them start from the channels owned by one company in particular, which is Meta.He added: “For purchase scams, we find Facebook Marketplace is the main place where those scams originate.”Shares in Imperial Leather maker PZ Cussons have plunged after the consumer goods giant revealed it had swung to a loss, as it continues to be rocked by volatility in the Nigerian economy.The Manchester-based maker of household brands including Imperial Leather, Carex and St.Tropez said “we have clearly had our challenges” as it unveiled its half-year results.The company showed it swung to a statutory pre-tax loss of £94.2m in the six months to December, down from a profit of £40.5m the previous year.Revenues fell by nearly 18pc over the same period, from £336.9m to £277.1m.The business has a major market in Nigeria, which represents more than a third of its total sales, and has regularly stressed a prolonged slump in the value of the naira, the country’s currency, has wiped money from its sales.It said the currency is about 70pc weaker than a year ago, which represents the biggest drop in value in its history. Inflation in the region is also at a 30-year high of nearly 30pc.PZ Cussons said this led to foreign exchange losses of about £88m, dragging on its profits and sales.Shares in PZ Cussons were down as much as 20.1pc to take it to the bottom of the FTSE 250.Siemens Energy swung to a €1.6bn (£1.3bn) net profit thanks to a one-off gain from the sale of a subsidiary to its parent company.Our energy editor Jonathan Leake has the latest:The troubled German-based company, which makes wind turbines used in many UK wind farms, is recovering from a financial crisis caused partly by quality issues in some of its onshore models and partly by industry-wide inflation and supply problems.Last year those crises forced it to seek financial guarantee from the German government for some of its projects.Siemens Energy has become a vital part of the UK wind industry. It owns a turbine blade factory in Hull that employs 1,200 people and which supplies many of the windfarms being built around the UK. Overall the company employs 6,000 people in the UK.President and chief executive Christian Bruch said the company was getting back on course.He said: “The solid first quarter is encouraging... our focus remains on solving the quality problems in our onshore wind business and making the most of the growth potential for the rest of the company.”Pandora, the world’s biggest jewellery maker, said its performance since the start of the year has been “healthy” with high single-digit sales growth, as it announced a share buyback programme after a strong run.Pandora, which sells charm bracelets, has been a rare bright spot among retailers and brands targeting aspirational consumers with affordable luxury items.The company aims for organic revenue growth of 6pc-9pc in 2024, after reporting strong sales of its silver charms and bracelets which have helped its share price to more than double since the start of last year.Soren Lontoft Hansen, senior analyst at Sydbank, said: “Despite the worldwide macroeconomic uncertainties… the company is manoeuvring strongly and better than the market.”The growth target is in line with a goal set in October for a 7-9pc compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2026.Pandora also announced a share buyback programme of up to 4 billion Danish krona (£457.1m), and a dividend of 18 Danish crowns per share. Its shares rose 0.5pc at the open.UK shares have edged downwards in early trading amid a a sell-off in precious mining stocks and uncertainty over interest rate cuts.The blue-chip FTSE 100 was down 0.2pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 index was flat.It was a good start for housebuilders after house prices rose at their the strongest annual rate in a year last month, adding to tentative signs of momentum in the property market.Developers across the FTSE 100 and 250 gained as much as 1.7pc before settling at gains of 0.1pc as a merger between Barratt and Redrow was also announced.Barratt Developments shares dropped as much as 8.9pc to the bottom of the FTSE 100 while Redrow shares climbed as much as 16.7pc to the peak of the FTSE 250.However, markets were dragged down by precious metal miners, which shed as much as 1.2pc on lower gold prices, ahead of speeches by Federal Reserve officials through the week.Soap maker PZ Cussons forecast a lower annual profit and slashed its interim dividend, sending its shares as much as 16.6pc lower to the bottom of FTSE 250.Analysts have been bashing away at their keyboards to make sense of Barratt’s takeover of rival housebuilder Redrow.Quilter Cheviot property fund research analyst Oli Creasey said:By some measures, Barratt is already the largest public housebuilder in the UK. It isn’t the most valuable company by market cap, but the volume of houses built in the past year is ahead of any of its peers.So we wouldn’t categorise this transaction as a need to build scale. However, there is likely to be a some element of cost synergies to be harvested as a result of combining two companies in the same industry, and a limited amount of geographical overlap.Looking at share prices, the deal is an attractive one for Redrow shareholders, who get a boost to the undisturbed share price, and become holders in a much larger business.It is less clear what the advantage is for Barratt, although given the structure of the deal, there’s limited downside – the all-share deal means that no cash needs to change hands, and the balance sheet strength is unchanged.It should also be noted that at a price equal to 1.2x Redrow’s NAV, it isn’t a particularly expensive price being paid, and will create the undisputed largest public housebuilder in the UK.German industrial production fell for a seventh straight month, official data showed, marking its longest series of declines since the period after reunification in the early 1990s.Output plunged by 1.6pc in December compared to the previous month, federal statistics agency Destatis said, following a revised 0.2pc fall in November.The drop was far worse than the 0.35pc decline predicted by analysts at FactSet and caps the longest run of falls since 1993.Melanie Debono at Pantheon Macroeconomics described the figures as “ugly”, adding: “The recession in industry will continue this quarter.”The sharper-than-expected decline was driven by steep falls in the chemical industry and the construction sector. The car industry meanwhile saw a 4pc rise in production.For the whole of 2023, industrial output was 1.5pc lower than a year earlier, Destatis said, and still below pre-pandemic levels.Germany’s crucial industrial sector, which used to be heavily reliant on cheap Russian gas imports, has been reeling ever since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine pushed energy costs higher.Higher interest rates and weaker export demand have added to the economic headwinds, as its economy shrank by 0.3pc last year.Capital Economics economist Franziska Palmas said that industry “remains a significant drag on growth”.She added: “We expect this to continue throughout 2024.”Die reale #Produktion im Produzierenden Gewerbe ist Dezember 2023 gegenüber November 2023 voraussichtlich um 1,6 % gesunken. Im Gesamtjahr 2023 lag sie um 1,5 % unter dem Vorjahr.

It also cancelled Ocean 2, also off the New Jersey coast, where construction was planned to start in 2028.The company recorded losses of 20.2bn Danish Kroner - about £2.2bn. This was despite operating profits of 19bn Danish kroner - about £2.2bn.TotalEnergies has reported the highest profit in its history - but still missed analyst expectations despite outperforming peers like Shell and BP.The French company said profit came in at $21.4bn (£17bn) in 2023, an increase of 4pc on the previous year but below predictions of $23.7bn.Its bottom line put the French energy conglomerate ahead of Shell, BP, Exxon-Mobil and Chevron, which all reported lower earnings in the face of weaker energy prices.However, TotalEnergies’s 2022 net profit had been weighed down by a huge exceptional charge - $15bn - from its withdrawal from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.Once non-recurring items were stripped out, profits suffered a sharp downturn last year, with adjusted net profit falling 36pc to $23.2bn.Oil and gas prices dropped some 10pc on average last year from 2022 when spiking oil prices had boosted earnings at energy companies worldwide.Chairman Patrick Pouyanne called the results “robust”, saying in a statement they had been achieved in “an uncertain environment”. Hydrocarbons had performed well, he said.It has been a mixed story for the shares of Barratt and Redrow after the announcement of their merger.Barratt shares have slipped 3.7pc - perhaps as shareholders bulk at the idea of holding 67.2pc of a combined company.Meanwhile, Redrow shares have surged by as much as 17pc after recommending the takeover, which values the business at £2.5bn.Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:The economic winds have not been kind to the housebuilders and Barratt Developments and Redrow clearly believe they’ll be stronger together, giving the new combined company much bigger clout to capitalise on the structural need for housing in the UK.Redrow’s share price has struggled to regain its pre-pandemic form and with Barratt enjoying a strong balance sheet and hefty cash reserves it clearly decided the time was right to make a move.Clearly market conditions are still going to be tougher while interest rates stay elevated.However, the latest signs are that recovery is underway, with the Halifax house price index pointing to renewed sentiment among buyers, as better mortgage deals have landed.The FTSE 100 opened higher following large gains on Wall Street and after Chinese regulators issued another set of market-enhancing policies.The UK’s blue chip index began the day up 0.1pc to 7,688.72 while the midcap FTSE 250 rose 0.2pc to 19,208.63.Sainsbury’s has unveiled plans to overhaul its supermarkets with a focus on creating more food space and revealed aims to slash costs by £1bn over the next three years.The UK’s second biggest supermarket chain said it would cut its general merchandise offering and clothing offering across many sites to create more space for food and ensure it is offering full grocery ranges in more stores.In its strategy update, the group said it will also “tighten the focus” of its non-food ranges, while adding there would be more changes for its Argos store estate, having already shut a raft of sites to bring many within supermarkets since it bought the retailer.The new plan - called Next Level Sainsbury’s - will see it cut costs by £1bn over the next three years, focusing on technology investments to deliver automation and savings.The increase in house prices for a fourth month in a row puts Britain about halfway towards a 3pc increase in house prices this year already, according to economists.Andrew Wishart, senior property economist at Capital Economics, said:The Halifax index has a track record of being quick to respond to changes in mortgage rates, so the large increases of 1.1pc in December and 1.3pc in January reflect the swift drop in the average quoted mortgage rate from 5pc in November to about 4.5pc in January.Fixed mortgage rates are unlikely to fall any further in the near term, which will restrain future monthly gains in the Halifax index.As the increase mirrored a large rise in the Nationwide index for the same month, there is little doubt that house prices made a strong start to the year.He added: “While we doubt that will continue (prices would rise by over 10pc this year if it did), our non-consensus call that house prices will rise this year looks like the right one.”The tie-up between Barratt and Redrow is expected to eventually lead to savings of at least £90m a year, the companies said.It comes as British housebuilders recover from the worst downturn since the financial crisis as high property prices and mortgage rates triggered a slump in sales last year.Last summer house price falls in July were more widespread than at any point since 2009, according to Rics’ UK residential market survey of estate agents.Redrow chief executive Matthew Pratt said:Redrow and Barratt combined creates a leading UK homebuilder.Together, we’ll be in a much better position to offer a broader range of high-quality and energy efficient homes to customers.He added: “The Redrow brand, with its premium, characterful homes, has an excellent reputation and will remain a key part of the Combined Group. As with Barratt, Redrow’s fifty-year success story is based on its people, products and supply chain partners. Both businesses are a great fit and there are many exciting opportunities to innovate and share knowledge across a range of different areas.”House builder Barratt will merge with its rival developer Redrow as the sector consolidates after the downturn caused by high interest rates.Barratt said it will buy the entire issued and to be issued share capital of its rival as part of the deal, creating a combined group which will be renamed as Barratt Redrow.The merger deal will offer Redrow shareholders 1.44 of new Barratt shares at a premium of 27.2pc, valuing the developer at £2.5bn.Once the takeover is complete, Redrow shareholders will hold approximately 32.8pc of the combined group and Barratt shareholders will hold approximately 67.2pc.Barratt chief executive David Thomas said the combined businesses “would leverage the respective strengths of both Barratt and Redrow, delivering significant benefits to our people, our supply chains, and - most importantly - our customers”.Redrow founder Steve Morgan added that Barratt is a home builder he has “long admired,” while chief executive Matthew Pratt said the combined companies “creates a leading UK homebuilder”House prices rose last month as falling mortgage rates increased the number of potential buyers, according to an industry survey.Property values increased by 1.3pc in January compared to the previous month, according to the Halifax house price index.It was the fourth monthly gain in a row after six consecutive falls before that.The survey found that average house prices increased to £291,029, which was £3,900 more than last month.Compared to the same month last year, property prices grew by 2.5pc, which was the highest annual growth since January 2023.Halifax Mortgages director Kim Kinnaird said:The recent reduction of mortgage rates from lenders as competition picks up, alongside fading inflationary pressures and a still-resilient labour market has contributed to increased confidence among buyers and sellers. This has resulted in a positive start to 2024’s housing market.However, while housing activity has increased over recent months, interest rates remain elevated compared to the historic lows seen in recent years and demand continues to exceed supply.For those looking to buy a first home, the average deposit raised is now £53,414, around 19pc of the purchase price. It’s not surprising that almost two thirds (63pc) of new buyers getting a foot on the ladder are now buying in joint names.Looking ahead, affordability challenges are likely to remain and further modest falls should not be ruled out, against a backdrop of broader uncertainty in the economic environment.Thanks for joining me. House prices increased for a fourth month in a row following the recent reduction in mortgage rates from lenders, according to the latest Halifax house price index.Average house prices increased to £291,029, which was £3,900 more than last month.1) Lockdown generation lacks basic workplace skills, says City grandee | Employers have noticed the negative impact on young recruits of lockdown measures, according to Baroness McGregor-Smith2) Bank of England pushed Britain into recession, economists say | Threadneedle Street has refused to communicate interest rates plan, economists say3) Why resurgent Ireland can’t afford to reunite – yet | Financial burden of absorbing the North could weigh down Dublin’s buoyant economy4) AI will trigger global surge in gas demand, says BP boss | Boom in tools such as ChatGPT means data centres require more power5) Jeremy Warner: The cost of lockdown is still becoming more devastating by the day | Young Britons will continue to pay the price of lost education for a generation to comeAsian stocks firmed on Wednesday as investors waited to see if Beijing’s increasingly frantic efforts to prop up its sagging share markets would actually work, while bonds enjoyed a reprieve from recent selling.In recent days, China’s regulators have announced further curbs on short selling and state investors said they were expanding their stock buying plans.Bloomberg News also reported President Xi Jinping would discuss the stock market with financial regulators, though there was no confirmation this had happened or what was discussed.However, the jury is very much out on how effective all this will prove and the blue chip index inched up 0.4% in choppy early trade, while Shanghai stocks added 0.9%.Tokyo’s blue-chip Nikkei shares drifted lower as investors digested corporate earnings.The benchmark Nikkei 225 index eased 0.1pc, or 40.74 points, to end at 36,119.92, while the broader Topix index added 0.4pc, or 10.70 points, at 2,549.95.Wall Street drifted higher during a quiet Tuesday as the bond market calmed down following some sharp swings.The S&P 500 rose 0.2pc, to 4,954.23, and nearly returned to its all-time high set at the end of last week.

Options Trader Wagers That Meta Shares Will Double Again`(Bloomberg) -- An options trader appears to be looking to parlay a winning bet on Meta Platforms Inc. into an even bigger windfall if the tech giant doubles — again — in the next 18 months.Most Read from BloombergHaley Loses Nevada Primary to ‘None of These Candidates’ OptionChina Replaces Top Markets Regulator as Xi Tries to End RoutTesla Asks Which Jobs Are Critical, Stoking Layoff FearsUS Commercial Real Estate Contagion Is Now Moving to EuropeTrump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals CourtEarly Wednesday, a trader sold a block of 19,000 call options that expire in June 2025 and allow the holder to purchase 1.9 million shares at $600, in exchange for twice as many calls with a $950 strike price expiring a year later, collecting $11.4 million.Holders of call options in Meta and other megacap tech stocks have seen ballooning profits, both from the increase in share prices that makes the options more valuable, but also the seeming unquenchable demand from investors looking to bet on further gains. Unlike most stocks, where there is a pronounced premium for bearish option contracts versus bullish as investors look to protect against losses, the incessant tech rally has flipped that on its head.“Meta is an example of a stock with skew to the calls,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group, adding that it’s rare to see this in an large cap equity and is an indication of “panic to the upside.”Selling the earlier calls — which appear to have been bought in mid-July when Meta was trading around $309 a share — likely netted millions of dollars in profits, though it’s hard to be sure as the position may have been rolled in July from an even lower level as shares rallied.While $950 seems like a far-away level, Meta shares doubled from November 2022 to March 2023, and doubled again between then and January.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went WrongThe Story Elon Musk Doesn’t Want to Talk AboutLayoffs Show That Tech Jobs Aren’t Sacred AnymoreHSBC’s New ‘Wise Killer’ App Vies for FX CustomersThe Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

Why Snap (SNAP) Stock Is Nosediving`Shares of social network Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) fell 34.5% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and average revenue per user (ARPU) missing analysts' expectations amid elevated expectations around changes in the direct response business. User growth was steady, with DAU (daily active users) ahead of estimates as net additions in Europe and the Rest of the World more than offset the customer attrition recorded in North America. This North America attrition is sure to ring alarm bells about competition, with Meta (NASDAQ:META) recently reporting very encouraging results.While next quarter's revenue guidance was in line, adjusted EBITDA guidance was well below. This shows that Snap's growth is coming at higher costs or less efficiency than expected. Moreover, the ARPU miss and the weakness in North America DAU indicate a challenging road ahead if the company aims to surpass expectations in the upcoming quarter. During the earnings call, management hinted at potential growth investments in North America and Europe and expressed optimism about avoiding further declines in North America in Q1. Overall, this was a mediocre quarter for Snap as the market was likely expecting more, considering the strong result reported by Meta earlier in the season.The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Snap? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.Snap's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 26 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Snap and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company gained 7.1% on the news that Meta reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector also suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024.Snap is down 29.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $11.33 per share it is trading 35.1% below its 52-week high of $17.45 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Snap's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,326.Do you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners`"In this article, we discuss 10 best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners. Global stocks reached their highest point in over two years, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record high on February 7, as per Reuters. This was driven by robust earnings, which helped counter concerns surrounding US regional banks and the Chinese markets. Bonds experienced slight pressure, as statements from Federal Reserve officials reinforced the expectation that the central bank might not reduce interest rates in the near future. According to Arthur Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth: ""We are at the midpoint of the 4Q earnings reporting season, and we would say that there has been more good news than bad.""In 2023, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 26.29%, recovering from the setback of 18.11% in 2022. In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts. The potential combination of declining interest rates and earnings growth is seen as a positive for stocks. However, analysts express worries about overvalued technology sector stocks, and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to introduce significant market volatility.Looking at historical data from 1921 to 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research, noted that the average S&P 500 bull market has yielded a return of 157% and lasted over four years. This historical pattern suggests the possibility of the stock market rally continuing in the foreseeable future. One notable success in the current bull market has been the performance of artificial intelligence technology as an investment theme. AI stocks were among the top performers in 2023, contributing to the market's overall positive trajectory. James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, commented: “The market’s recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI.” On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee suggests a more cautious outlook for 2024, anticipating an average year for markets rather than double-digit gains. Concerns include the S&P 500's elevated forward price/earnings ratio and a historically low equity risk premium. Valuations indicate potential sub-par annual stock returns, with estimates pointing to a 4% gain compared to the long-run average of 7%-8%. Analysts' optimistic projections for 2024 U.S. corporate earnings are questioned, with expectations of a tapering in economic growth from 7% to 4%. The market's assumption of a more aggressive Fed rate-cutting stance contrasts with public signals, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions as emergency programs wind down in 2024.Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, remarked: “As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.” Some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology For this list, we used a stock screener and selected stable companies with high single digit or low-teens revenue growth.

The Company reported double-digit revenue, operating earnings and earnings per share growth during their third quarter. The Company has been able to adjust pricing in its health care segment to keep up with medical cost inflation while working with its Optum units to deliver more value-based care that replaces the traditional fee for service health care model. Value-based care is a sensible, long-term growth opportunity for the Company to pursue and also differentiates it from the vast majority of healthcare providers, particularly as it relates to Medicare patients. For example, the Company’s value-based care programs provide more preventative care opportunities and home-based care visits for patients which helps save the U.S. healthcare system billions in unnecessary spending while also providing patients with better outcomes, as diseases and behaviors are caught or corrected at earlier stages. The Company has invested in several core assets over many years to execute this value-based strategy and it will become the standard of care as the proportion of people in the U.S. with healthcare insurance coverage continues to reach new highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.00%JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, and other products for data centers, gaming, and embedded applications. It is one of the best cheap beginner stocks to invest in. On February 1, Citi analyst Christopher Danely observed that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, anticipating $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi suggested that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) may intentionally be underestimating, and the company's CEO expressed confidence in surpassing the $3.5 billion figure for this year. The analyst estimated that AMD could generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from its MI300, according to buy-side investors' expectations.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion. White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.60%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), a diversified software company, operates globally through three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.30%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a global provider of customer relationship management technology, facilitating the connection between companies and customers.

(NYSE:CRM), same as the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with roughly 15 million shares worth $4 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) ranks 6th on our list of the top cheap stocks for beginners in 2024. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners.  Suggested articles:Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks15 Best Bitcoin Wallets For iPhone and Android11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:47:16.818508`AMZN
Do Not Fight this Market: 3 Top Ranked Stock to Join the Rally`After such a strong finish in 2023 and follow through at the start of 2024, investors are wondering when the correction is coming. While it is natural to expect some sort of pull-back I think investors would be best off not trying to predict, and instead continue buying top-ranked stocks.Below we can see the Nasdaq 100 is breaking out of this bullish looking consolidation, and the S&P 500 is very nearly pushing through the 5,000 level.Image Source: TradingViewFurthermore, there are many powerful investment themes keeping the markets bid, including a robust economy, exciting technological developments, and tremendous government spending deficits. That last item is definitely worth considering when wondering when the economy is going to slowdown.Because of the massive spending behind the most recent infrastructure bill, where more than $1 trillion is going to be spent, many laid off workers are likely to be soaked up by the public sector, and spending to continue.Based on these influential economic developments, investors should focus on continuing to buy leading stocks with top Zacks ranks, because a major economic slowdown is becoming less and less likely.Here I will share three stocks with top Zacks ranks, and market beating performance over the last month. I particularly like to look for stocks showing relative strength while the market continues to grind higher.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMercadoLibreMercadoLibre MELI, is the Latin-American version of Amazon, building an e-commerce platform that continues to boom in popularity. MercadoLibre has been one of the most exciting stocks in the last few years and its returns continue to delight investors willing to own shares.In addition to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, the company is forecasting impressive growth in sales and earnings.This year, sales are expected to climb 36% YoY to $14.3 billion, while EPS are set to expand 134% to $22.30 per share. That growth is projected to continue on to the next year as well, with sales expected to grow 22.3% the following year, and EPS to increase 57.6%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to the fundamental developments in MercadoLibre, its technical advances are compelling as well. In addition to relative strength against the market, it has been forming a very nice technical trade pattern to measure a breakout trade from.For investors waiting for a technical signal to enter MELI, a move above $1764 would market a clean breakout from this bullish consolidation.Image Source: TradingViewStoneCoStoneCo STNE is a Brazilian financial technology company specializing in payment processing solutions. Founded in 2012, StoneCo provides a range of services, including electronic payments, credit card processing, and point-of-sale technology for businesses of varying sizes.StoneCo has seen earnings estimates steadily trend higher over the last 10 months, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Additionally, the company is entering a period where EPS are expected to expand significantly. Earnings are forecast to grow 167% YoY this year, and 36.1% next year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MercadoLibre, StoneCo stock is forming a convincing technical pattern. STNE stock was hit hard at the end of 2022 and traded sideways at a depressed level for nearly two years.However, at the end of 2023, the stock initiated a stage one breakout, indicating investors had been buying the depressed stock. Now over the last two months, STNE price action has built out a weekly bull flag, leading me to believe another big breakout is coming.If STNE stock trades above the $18.50 level, investors could rush in to buy the stock sending it significantly higher.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon.comFinally, one of the world's leading companies, Amazon AMZN just reported an incredibly strong quarter of financials sending the stock much higher.Following the earnings gap up, Amazon stock is forming a post earnings consolidation, a very high probability trading setup. Above $171 and AMZN should make a run at its all-time high.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon has also been garnering interest from analysts, who have been steadily upgrading earnings estimates. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 22% and current quarter earnings by 12.5%.Earnings at the e-commerce and technology giant are expected to grow by an impressive 28.1% annually over the next 3-5 years, driven by its AWS and new advertising business segments.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe great thing about investing in stocks is that the best ones offer tremendous asymmetric opportunities. There is no reason to try and predict market selloffs, because so long as you focus on buying top-tier securities, the returns take care of themselves. That is not to say that risk management isn’t key, but good investors are often optimists. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Down 61% in the Past Year, Has This E-Commerce Stock Entered Bargain Territory?`The last 12 months were a good period in general for e-commerce stocks. Companies like Amazon, Shopify, MercadoLibre, and Pinduoduo saw their share prices rise at least 30%.But the industry had its laggards too, including JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), which saw its shares fall 61% in the past year. With the stock now down 78% from its all-time high, JD.com has attracted some investors looking to take advantage of a potential bargain.But before you rush into the stock, you should understand how JD.com got here in the first place. Only then can you make an informed investment decision.JD.com is one of the more successful companies replicating Amazon's playbook.The e-commerce giant operates a first-party e-commerce business in China by selling a wide range of products directly to customers. It also operates a third-party marketplace that allows other sellers on its platform, in exchange for fees from each successful transaction.The company emphasizes low prices to encourage customers to buy more over time, and it operates a complex logistics service to offer speedy deliveries. The low prices and fast delivery leads to strong customer retention and sales growth, providing JD.com with the scale needed to drive prices even lower and continuously improve its service.Customers love the approach, which explains the company's uninterrupted growth for many years. For perspective, revenue grew revenue at a compound annual rate of 27% from 2017 to 2021. Everything seemed to be moving in the right direction until recently.Investors accustomed to such an impressive track record were disappointed when the e-commerce company reported just 10% revenue growth in 2022. Subsequent months were even more challenging for the company with revenue growth declining to just 2% in Q3 2023. Revenue from its flagship first-party e-commerce business actually fell 1% year over year, masked by a 13% increase in service revenue.To add salt to the wound, competitor PDD Holdings reported 94% top-line growth in the same quarter. Even Alibaba, which is facing its own challenges, reported 9% growth.JD.com is failing to keep up with the competition. It didn't help that previous CEO Xu Lei stepped down from his post in May 2023 after just one year, adding another layer of uncertainty to the company's future.The silver lining here is the fact the company is still profitable with a strong balance sheet. JD.com generated 39 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in free cash flow in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2023. It also had 242 billion yuan ($33.2 billion) in cash and short-term investments. With this solid financial position, JD.com can continue to invest in areas like live-streaming shopping, supply chain improvements, and other initiatives.Still, investors should be aware the path ahead remains challenging as it will have to outmaneuver rivals like Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and Douyin.So JD.com is at a crossroads. Despite its previous success, the future is far less certain now that it faces a more competitive industry and greater regulatory scrutiny.Given the recent bearish sentiment, JD.com stock trades at a significant discount to other e-commerce companies with a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is just 10.2, while Pinduoduo trades at 27.8 times earnings.Investors should monitor JD.com's rebound efforts in the coming quarters for clues of its progress. If the company can defend its position as a top three e-commerce platform in China and rekindle growth, its current stock price should prove to be a bargain.Should you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?Before you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JD.com wasn’t one of them.

3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now`"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is off to a great start in 2024. The e-commerce giant is making progress along all fronts of its multifaceted business, and its stock is up 66% over the past year.You might not realize that it's still trading below all-time highs. But the way things are going, Amazon stock is likely to surpass that in the coming months, and now is a great time to buy it.Here are three specific reasons to be confident about Amazon stock this year.Amazon made a strategic decision last year to restructure its distribution network from a national one to a regional one. The rationale was that the national network was large and cumbersome, making it take longer, on average, to get products to customers. A regional network stocked with high-selling items would get products to customers faster and at a lower cost.It now has eight regional distribution centers, and the results speak for themselves. In the 2023 fourth quarter, Amazon delivered 65% more items overnight than in the prior year. CEO Andy Jassy noted that as Amazon fulfills orders faster, customers choose it for more orders.In a first since 2018, Amazon has decreased its per-unit cost to fulfill globally, and in the U.S., fulfillment cost per unit decreased by more than $0.45 from last year. This allows Amazon to expand its selection profitably at lower average selling prices, improving its chances of gaining market share.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud services arm. Until recently, AWS sales were reliable to grow at rates around 35% in a typical quarter. That began to drop when inflation became severe, and client businesses started to cut their budgets.However, Amazon continues to lead the industry with 32% of the overall market according to Statista, and sales growth improved in the fourth quarter to 13% year over year. Jassy said the company is seeing larger deals accelerate; it announced several new deals with companies like Salesforce, BMW, and Nvidia.The company launched a robust suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services for AWS, and adoption rates are strong. The company offers three layers of AI to meet the varied needs of its clients, from the most customizable to partially customizable, with the top layer being a generative AI ""coded companion."" Last week, Amazon launched Rufus, a personal shopping generative AI application that takes customer queries and offers product recommendations based on requirements.Jassy said Amazon will continue to invest heavily in AI since it offers the opportunity to revolutionize the shopping and processing experience for its customers, and it sees this as a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years.Amazon only started to break out advertising as its own business segment in late 2021, when it grew 32% year over year, trailing AWS at 40%. With the other businesses slowing down, advertising has become the fastest-growing reporting segment, increasing 26% over last year in the 2023 fourth quarter. That was driven by sponsored ads.Advertising is a no-brainer for Amazon third-party sellers since it exposes them to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers. Amazon's top AI helps them target potential buyers with high accuracy.Amazon recently changed its streaming program to an ad-supported track, like Netflix and Walt Disney, which should pump up this segment even more. This will likely remain a strong business for Amazon in the near term, and as advertisers revisit their budgets after inflation-induced cuts, they're liable to spend more. Some percentage of that will go to Amazon.These are only part of the story. Amazon is making strides in smaller endeavors like cashierless stores, healthcare, and more. 2024 could be a banner year for Amazon, and in the long term, it's likely to add value to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks`"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 5 Stocks.Jim Cramer said in a latest program that after listening to the Fed chair Jerome Powell he believes we are at ""crossroads"" since there is still ""some inflation"" and the ""dichotomy"" of hard landing versus soft landing is being ""replaced by no landing."" Cramer said that we are ""back to reality"" and the reality, according to Cramer, is that interest rates are still ""not that high."" Cramer believes the rates are at a level where the economy can keep working. Cramer wondered how and why the Fed would cut interest rates when strong employment numbers keep coming and inflation is also not going down significantly.Jim Cramer tried to convince his viewers to invest in the stock market and said that while it would seem ""reckless"" to invest in the stock market because of the risks involved, it would be ""too late"" to invest in stocks once the Fed begins to cut interest rates. Jim Cramer said that stocks are in a win-win situation. If the economy keeps growing and the market remains strong, stocks will go up. If the economy begins to slow down, the Fed would cut rates sometime in the future, causing a rally in the stock market. Jim Cramer, however, acknowledged that stocks are risky when compared to the steady 5% income on CDs.Cramer said ""great"" stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can give you that ""5% from CDs"" in ""a week or even a day.""Cramer said that he has ""no illusions"" and he is convinced that now is the right time to buy stocks. Cramer said he thinks many investors would be inclined towards investing in low-risk index funds or parking their cash in CDs or treasuries but he thinks big money will be made by investing in individual stocks.But Jim Cramer is not bullish on all stocks. In fact over the past couple of years or so he's become quite selective in his choices and keeps recommending investors to sell or stay away from low-quality, money-losing or risky stocks and instead buy best of breed and high quality stocks.In this article we will talk about some stocks Cramer is bearish on.MethodologyFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to either stay away from or sell. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment where available. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/ASports and outdoor equipment company Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) recently went public in an IPO that fell short of expectations. Cramer had advised investors to stay away from the stock. He said:“So far, this is looking like another out of favor IPO, even if its lowball price allowed the stock to get a like, I guess you could call it a decent pop. And, I’ve got to tell you, Amer Sports is a great example of the kind of deals I wish we weren’t seeing.”One of the reasons why Cramer is bearish on Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) is the company's high exposure to China.While Cramer is bearish on the stock, Canadian billionaire Chip Wilson, who also founded Lululemon Athletica, bought $324 million worth of shares at the company’s IPO.While Cramer is bearish on companies like Amer Sports, he's recommending buying high-quality mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 9Last month, Jim Cramer was asked about Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC). Cramer recommended the questioner to ""take a pass"" on the stock. Cramer said the ""greatest inventor of our time"" Elon Musk does not like lithium companies and he is trying to figure out a way to cut our dependence on them. Cramer said he would not go against Musk.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Surgical facilities company Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on these days. When asked about Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) in a recent program on CNBC, Cramer said ""that industry is in up and down right now.""""I'm taking a hard pass,"" Cramer said of Surgery Partners.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The biggest stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is owned by Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $157 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth.

3 Inspiring Underdogs That Fought Tech Giants and Won`"When it comes to success in emerging industries, size usually matters. Pioneers often fail, leaving behind the foundation for larger players to dominate. Thankfully for investors in mold-breaking upstarts, it doesn't always play out that way.Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Sonos (NASDAQ: SONO), and Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) are three companies that saw Apple and other consumer tech behemoths try to take them out. The little guys are not just surviving, but thriving against established titans with almost limitless resources. Take a bow Roku, Sonos, and Spotify.Roku founder Anthony Wood invented the digital video recorder, but it was another company that enjoyed the DVR glory. He got it right when he launched Roku a few years later, pioneering the streaming video revolution. It wasn't long before Roku was joined by some of the most valuable companies on the planet. Apple TV, Alphabet's Google Chromecast, and Amazon's Fire TV hit the market. Roku didn't flinch.Roku remains the leading operating system for smart TVs in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It has roughly double the market share of its closest rival. It doesn't matter that Google and Amazon are willing to practically give away the hardware to get folks connected. Roku has been able to sacrifice product margins, knowing it can make it up in volume.Roku is free to use, making the lion's share of its revenue from ad sharing and referrals. It's working. Average revenue per user is more than $41 over the past year. There are 75.8 million active accounts on the platform, and boy are they active. Roku users are spending an average of 3.8 hours a day streaming through the Roku hub.It doesn't seem possible. Roku is competing against Apple, a company that is used to getting people to pay a premium for its wares. Alphabet is the global leader in online advertising, putting it in the perfect position to cash in on an ad-supported industry. Amazon is the top dog in online retail, and it aggressively promotes its Fire TV dongles and smart TVs on its platform. Roku is still beating them all.Roku's enemies are also rivals of Sonos. It was 2005 when Sonos rolled out the first wireless multiroom speaker system, which streams audio seamlessly through a home. Audiophiles flocked to Sonos, but then familiar foes emerged. Apple, Amazon, and Google all had cheap smart speakers in support of their virtual assistant technologies. Sonos was in their crosshairs if they chose to go upmarket, but they missed.Sonos would go on to deliver 17 consecutive years of revenue growth before proving mortal in fiscal 2023. On Tuesday afternoon it posted financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. It was a well-received report.Revenue declined 9%, or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. It's not pretty, but analysts were bracing for a 13% decline. The bigger surprise is at the other end of the income statement. Profitability improved at Sonos, earning $0.64 a share for the seasonally potent holiday quarter, up from $0.57 a share a year earlier. Wall Street pros were settling for a sharp decline to $0.39 a share.""Despite the challenging environment, we are winning in the market and outperforming the competition,"" CEO Patrick Spence said in this week's earnings report.Rich in cash and patents, Sonos is well positioned to continue dominating its high-end niche. With analyst profit targets now likely headed higher, Sonos is cheap.Remember when everyone figured that Spotify was toast? The Swedish audio streaming service was making waves worldwide, but would it be able to succeed in the U.S. as Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Amazon Music flooded the market? It's doing pretty well, even if it had to go through three rounds of layoffs last year.There are 602 million mostly ad-supported monthly active users, a 23% increase over the past year. Getting folks to pay is the more difficult nut to crack, but Spotify has been beefing up its catalog of original content to go with its industry-leading music platform. Premium Spotify accounts have risen 15% over the past year to reach 236 million.Apple and Amazon are distant competitors. Google Play Music threw in the towel, handing its digital ambitions over to YouTube Music. It's going to be hard for the other streaming service stocks to catch up to Spotify now.Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

How Twitter's descent into chaos is paving the way for a new web`"The post-Twitter era has spurred the development and further growth of numerous social networks that prioritize brief posts, from open source standbys like Mastodon to new decentralized concepts like Bluesky, and those from smaller startups like Post, Spill, and Spoutible, to those from tech giants like Meta, which launched the Twitter-like Threads. While this is great news for people looking for a new place to land after Twitter's demise (the network under Elon Musk is now called X and headed in a different direction), it's a challenge for early adopters who want to experiment with new apps and services.Not everyone is satisfied with X's current course. Though a top-ranked app today, it's not the Twitter of years past. X takes a lax approach to content moderation, leaving advertisers and some users in search of new options. Even its owner dabbles in antisemitism and trolling, prompting more of the same from the user base. As top advertisers fled, X's ads became worse and more spammy.Elon Musk says ‘go f*ck yourself’ to advertisers leaving XThe changes at X have been swift and troublesome, leading to a flurry of activity in the social sphere as X alternatives emerged. But now there's too much of a good thing.The Twitter diaspora, so to speak, is hungry for a solution to save them from having to browse content from across half a dozen apps, in addition to the news websites, blogs, and other information sources they already consume while online.That problem is now being addressed by another group of developers -- those who aren't trying to re-create Twitter or improve upon it, but solve the problem of there being ""too many Twitters"" to keep up with.Last week, we reported on Tapestry, a new project from The Iconfactory, the app development shop best known for its work on the early Twitter client Twitterrific. Recently funded on Kickstarter after only showing off its prototype build, Tapestry aims to offer a unified app for tracking social media, news, and RSS feeds in one place. That includes posts from X, Bluesky, Mastodon, Tumblr, and others in the future, like perhaps Threads.The Iconfactory was only looking to raise $100,000 to start development of the new app. It was fully funded as of February 5 and has since exceeded that, which allows it to now chase stretch goals of $150,000 and up, which would fund additional features for the app, like muting, filtering, search, bookmarking, and more.Image Credits: The IconfactoryThe Iconfactory isn't the only developer who has seized on this moment to develop a new multi-service social app.The developer behind the popular Mac and iOS newsreader app Reeder, Silvio Rizzi, is now working on something of a Reeder replacement. Though Rizzi says Reeder will continue to be supported, the new project aims to offer more than just news feeds. In an announcement on Mastodon last week, the developer teased plans for an app that's ""not just an RSS reader,"" but instead a tool that would allow you to access content from across sources, like ""podcasts, YouTube, Mastodon, and more,"" he said.The app is expected to launch into public beta later this spring on Mac, iPhone, and iPad. (A screenshot of the app concept Rizzi posted offered a nod to Tapestry, as both projects emerged around the same time.)Image Credits: Silvio RizziMeanwhile, Tapbots, the makers of Mastodon client Ivory (and previously the Twitter app Tweetbot on which it's based), is weighing how to approach the growing number of social networks available to users. There is no single Twitter alternative, so deciding where to focus limited developer resources is key.According to Tapbots co-founder Paul Haddad, the company hasn't yet decided whether it will support Bluesky yet, but says they are thinking about it.""We’ve got our next few months pretty booked with Ivory/Mastodon features and of course are committed to the Fediverse long-term,"" he told TechCrunch, referring to the decentralized social web powered by the ActivityPub protocol. ""We do plan to take a look at Bluesky sometime after that.""However, if Tapbots chooses to support Bluesky, it may or may not be part of the Ivory app, he added.Other services are focused on the needs of power users and creators to cross-post to multiple networks at once. This includes scheduling tools like those from fedica and Postpone, as well as consumer apps like Yup. The latter offers a solution for posting to X, Bluesky, Farcaster, Lens, and Threads, though it lacks access to a Threads developer API, requiring users to disable Instagram’s two-factor authentication (2FA) to get it to work. (We do NOT recommend this.)Image Credits: YupSimilarly, an app from a Japanese developer, Sora, offers access to Mastodon, Bluesky, and the federated networks Misskey and Firefish.Then there are the various web3, blockchain-based networks, and protocols, like Farcaster and Lens, as well as other decentralized protocols that are fostering networks of their own, like Nostr (favored by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey these days). There's also the decentralized network Matrix, which offers multiple cross-platform clients.Even Reddit has inspired decentralized alternatives, like Lemmy, /kbin, and other smaller projects.Because not all the decentralized networks talk to each other, bridges between protocols are also being built, like those that connect Matrix to Nostr or Mastodon to Bluesky, among others.Quipped Columbia Journalism Review journalist and longtime tech early adopter Mathew Ingram in a post on Threads, ""We need a FriendFeed for the 2000s.""His reference recalls a former era of social networking plenty, Web 2.0, when users turned to a social networking aggregator co-founded by then-former Googlers Bret Taylor (former Salesforce Co-CEO), Gmail creator Paul Buchheit, Jim Norris, and Sanjeev Singh. FriendFeed brought together social networking websites, bookmarking sites, websites, blogs, and microblogs into one place -- something that's again in demand today following the explosion of Twitter alternatives and decentralized services.Of course, Facebook eventually acquired FriendFeed and began to dominate social media, shutting out even well-resourced competitors like Google+. Now known as Meta, the social networking giant remains unbeaten, with nearly 3.2 billion users across its family of apps. But in its rush to adopt the ActivityPub protocol in its new app Threads, also used by Mastodon, there's a hint of concern. It suggests that even Meta believes the tide could possibly turn against it, as users embrace these alternative social platforms.For some smaller apps, the decision is whether to try to compete with the growing number of alternatives or join them. For instance, the Twitter competitor, Spoutible, founded by Christopher Bouzy, the developer of a Twitter analytics service previously, announced in December that his network would ""soon"" integrate with Mastodon for cross-posting and later, Threads.""Users being able to post across various platforms positions Spoutible not just as a social media platform but as a versatile tool designed to streamline your digital communication,"" he wrote, after it was clear Spoutible was not among those favored to win the competition to be the new Twitter.Unfortunately for people in hopes of a simple cross-posting solution, Spoutible this month faced security issues when it was revealed the API had a serious vulnerability that could allow hackers to take control of user accounts. The API even returned users' 2FA (two-factor authentication) code and the reset tokens that helped users change passwords. That puts Spoutible's cross-posting plans on the back burner for the time being, if not its future altogether.Another Web 2.0 survivor, Flipboard, also recently decided integration was the best path forward. It ditched Twitter and integrated with Mastodon while rebuilding its backend to join the fediverse -- the decentralized social web. The social magazine app also became the first app to support Bluesky, Mastodon, and Pixelfed (a decentralized Instagram alternative) last May, allowing users to track updates across these social networks, as well as YouTube, all in one place.Image Credits: FlipboardAnother platform, micro.blog, is looking to address the cross-posting needs from a different angle: as the blog host. Instead of creating content directly on social platforms, users could publish to micro.blog, follow other bloggers, and engage in conversations, while also still cross-posting to more popular platforms including Mastodon, Medium, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Flickr, Bluesky, Nostr, and Pixelfed. (The Iconfactory said its forthcoming app Tapestry would also support micro.blog).Elsewhere, publishing giant WordPress acquired an ActivityPub plugin to allow WordPress blogs to join the fediverse. Newsletter platform Substack created a short-form ""Notes"" feed that resembled Twitter. Artifact, the aggregator from Instagram's co-founders, eventually pivoted to cloning Twitter before shutting down.In short, a lot is going on in the social web today. And this is by no means a definitive list of those companies and developers attacking the problem -- or adding to it. Unnamed are, of course, the wide variety of open source and smaller projects in the works, too, as is common when open APIs are available.Whether this explosion of new social networks is a temporary problem or a new state of being remains to be seen. Likely, some of the smaller ""Twitter-alts"" will eventually die off, after failing to gain traction, or will fold into the wider fediverse, as the would-be Twitter rival Pebble (formerly T2) did last year.But it's also possible that we're witnessing the rebuilding of the web in real time. One where there are many protocols, many platforms, and many ways to connect not just people, but also their media, and their ideas, along with links to websites, news, and blogs.Aggregators like Tapestry may be an initial step to figuring out how to navigate this new web, but it also calls out for a way to search it too: a new Google of sorts that plugs into all the activity now taking place beyond websites, including the information that's shared through these novel social networks across new protocols. And who is building that?Twitterrific’s team is back with Tapestry, an app for tracking social media, news, RSS and moreAs Bluesky opens to the public, CEO Jay Graber faces her biggest challenge yetThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/07/how-twitters-descent-into-chaos-is-paving-the-way-for-a-new-web/Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:47:27.822602`META
Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Magnificent 7 ETFs Rise on Blockbuster Earnings`"The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Tesla TSLA, now account for almost 30% of the S&P 500 index. They were responsible for more than 62% of the S&P 500’s total return in 2023.Most experts anticipated a broadening of the market rally in 2024; however, market leadership has narrowed further this year. These stocks have driven more than 80% of the index's rise.All these companies benefited from the AI hype in 2023, but we've seen divergent performances in 2024 as investors assess which will emerge as the biggest beneficiaries of the forthcoming AI boom.Nvidia and Meta are leading the group, while Tesla significantly lags. This divergence has expanded in the past few weeks, as all but one reported their financial results. Meta's results were particularly well-received, sending the shares of the social media giant up more than 20%.Tesla has been punished for missing both earnings and revenue estimates. The EV giant’s earnings were down almost 46% amid weakening margins. The stock has lost 26% of its value this year.While NVIDIA is yet to announce its results, its stock has already appreciated by 42% in 2024, following a 240% increase in 2023, as most other giants disclosed aggressive AI investments.The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS provides equal weight exposure to these stocks.

Meta challenges supervisory fee for EU online content rules`"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Meta Platforms has challenged a supervisory fee amounting to 0.05% of its annual worldwide net income aimed at covering EU regulators' costs of monitoring compliance with new European Union rules requiring it to do more to police content.The European Commission has said the Digital Services Act (DSA) levy applies to 20 very large online platforms, including Meta, Google, Apple and TikTok and two very large online search engines.The size of the annual fee is related to the number of average monthly active users for each company and whether it posts a profit or loss in the preceding financial year.Meta said it disagreed with the methodology used to calculate the fees.""Currently, companies that record a loss don't have to pay, even if they have a large user base or represent a greater regulatory burden, which means some companies pay nothing, leaving others to pay a disproportionate amount of the total,"" a Meta spokesperson said.The company has challenged the levy at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest. Politico was the first to report about Meta's move.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by David Gregorio)Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:47:27.822602`META
Meta accused of not taking Facebook Marketplace fraud seriously`Meta has been accused by MPs of not taking the problem of online fraud on its platforms seriously.The parent company of Facebook and Instagram came under scrutiny from the Home Affairs Select Committee after representatives from the banking sector said the “majority” of scams they see start on Meta platforms.Paul Davis, financial crime prevention director at TSB, told the committee that Facebook Marketplace is the “main place” where purchase scams originate, which, along with investment and impersonation scams, are the most common types of fraud affecting bank customers.“For those three types, which as I say are the main ones, we see about 80% start on social media,” Mr Davis told MPs.“Indeed, let’s not walk past the fact that, when I say social media there, the majority of them start from the channels owned by one company in particular, which is Meta.”🗣️We are now live and questioning banks and big tech firms on how they protect people from fraud. We are hearing from:@TSB@RevolutApp@santanderuk@Meta@BTGroup@Microsoft📺Watch here: https://t.co/tzoMPErfmQ pic.twitter.com/W9vtl7DRJe— Home Affairs Committee (@CommonsHomeAffs) February 7, 2024He added: “Facebook Marketplace doesn’t have a payments channel attached to it, it’s not like a website you might use to buy something off a high street shop, for example, or Amazon. So, you have to get bank details from the seller of that item.“What we see are customers telling us that they get bank details from the seller, send them money and then the item never turns up.”In response, Philip Milton, public policy manager for fraud at Meta, told the committee that the tech giant takes the issue “extremely seriously”.When suggested by the committee that evidence given to MPs by the banks shows Meta is not doing all it can to prevent online fraud, Mr Milton said: “I disagree with that.”He went on: “To give you an idea of the scale that we’re putting in place to tackle this kind of thing, since 2016 we’ve invested 20 billion dollars on safety and security, and that’s not slowing down – five billion of that was in the last year alone.“We have 40,000 people working across the company on safety and security. Half of that number are involved in directly reviewing content, so we invest significantly in trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening.”He added that fraud “fundamentally undermines the experience we’re trying to provide for people” and said this, combined with fraudulent advertising affecting trust in the company from advertisers and its wider reputation, means the firm is “directly incentivised” to do all it can to prevent criminal activity.However, committee member Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, argued that the five billion dollars Meta said it spent last year on safety and security equates to less than 4% of the firm’s annual revenue for the year – a figure he suggested is “not very high”.Mr Loughton also questioned whether the 20,000 people reviewing content for Meta is an adequate number given the site has “four billion active accounts”, and suggested the social media giant is not taking the issue “terribly seriously” because, as Facebook Marketplace does not have a payments channel linked to it, the site is not financially liable if fraud takes place there.“You apparently have no financial skin in the game for clamping down on fraud on Facebook Marketplace other than potential reputational damage,” he said.“Unless there’s a clear link with advertisers walking away with their revenue because they’re concerned at (banking sector research showing) 80% of fraud starting on (social media platforms) and 68% of it specifically your platforms, then you don’t really have to take it terribly seriously – and the fact you’re spending five billion dollars out of an annual revenue of 134.9 billion, which, as I say, is three and a bit percent for a people-based service, is tiny.“So you’re not taking this problem seriously, are you?”In response, Mr Milton said: “I don’t agree with that at all”, and argued that “the scale of our investment demonstrates how seriously we take this problem”, adding that it is “market-leading” levels of funding for safety and security.He added that, in response to tactics from fraudsters who demand payment or ask for an item to be sent before it is paid for, Meta has “removed the ability to ship an item on Facebook Marketplace”, and that there is “no way to pay for an item” on the platform because the firm is trying to “design out” the ability for criminals to use the platform for fraud.Related Quotes`2024-02-08 00:47:27.822602`META
Germany forced to slash DHL stake by €2.2bn to fix railways`Germany has been forced to sell off some of its stake in package deliverer DHL as it struggles to improve the country’s rail network amid a budget crisis.The KfW bank, which holds the government’s remaining stakes in previously state-held companies, said it has sold 50 million shares of Deutsche Post, the name under which it still trades on the stock exchange.The €2.2bn (£1.9bn) sale, at €43.45 each, cuts the German state’s share in the company by 4pc to 16.5pc.Germany’s finance ministry said the money would be used to strengthen the capital of Germany’s main railway operator, the state-owned Deutsche Bahn, and to improve railway infrastructure.The government has been forced to turn to share sales to help finance improvements to the rail network after a court ruling forced it to plug a big hole in this year’s budget and reconsider its wider financial plans.In November, Germany’s highest court annulled a decision made by the government in 2022 to repurpose €60bn originally meant to cushion the fallout from the pandemic for measures to help combat climate change and modernise the country.Read the latest updates below.Thanks for joining us today. My colleague Chris Price will be back in the morning, reporting on the latest company news as the London markets open.Brussels has waved through new rules that will force derivative traders to clear deals through the European Union, dealing the latest blow to the City. Our reporter Adam Mawardi has the details:London could lose control of its lucrative clearing market after EU officials backed proposals to shift more business activity to operators across the bloc.The provisional rules require banks and asset managers above a certain threshold to clear derivative contracts, such as euro interest rate swaps, through accounts with EU-based clearing houses.Vincent Van Peteghem, Belgium’s finance minister who helped negotiate the agreement with the European Parliament, said: “This will bring more clearing services to Europe and enhance our strategic autonomy.”Clearing houses serve as middlemen between buyers and sellers for financial assets and ensure deals go through even when counterparties default.They have become a crucial part of the banking system following the 2008 financial crisis which exposed the risks around derivative trading.The controversial change is designed to make EU clearing houses more attractive, effectively ending Europe’s reliance on UK-based rivals following Brexit.Read the full report...The sovereign wealth fund behind McLaren is seeking to bring in new investors to help fund the British carmaker’s growth, according to a report.McLaren’s controlling shareholder, Mumtalakat of Bahrain, is looking to raise additional investment to develop McLaren’s technology and enter new markets.

McLaren declined to comment.Ryanair is concerned by shortcomings identified by US regulators in a report into the Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 accident, the airline’s chief Michael O’Leary said on Wednesday.A door plug that flew off an Alaska Airlines MAX 9 jet mid-flight on Jan 5 appeared to be missing four key bolts, according to a preliminary report by the US National Transportation Safety Board released on Tuesday.Michael O’Leary said today:I think we’re concerned because it highlights, you know, poor production quality with Boeing. .. but we don’t think it affects our Boeing 737 fleet or the Max 8 that we operate.Ryanair, which is Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers and one of Boeing’s main customers, has ordered over 350 Max jets in recent years, but has no Max 9 aircraft.He said the last 12 aircraft Ryanair received in October-December showed quality improvements from earlier in the year, “but Boeing have clearly more to do”.He added:There’s no doubt that the increased supervision by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) in Seattle will slow things down. We’re just not sure yet whether it will affect our deliveries between now and the end of June.Boeing told The Telegraph:Ryanair is a valued customer and we are working closely with them to address their concerns. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to improve our quality and delivery performance and will support our customers every step of the way.Rishi Sunak must slash Britain’s benefits bill instead of relying on immigration if he wants to get the country’s debts under control, according to an official at the UK’s budget watchdog. Szu Ping Chan reports:Rishi Sunak must slash Britain’s benefits bill instead of relying on immigration if he wants to get the country’s debts under control, according to an official at the UK’s budget watchdog.David Miles, an executive member of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said waves of new migrants would not solve Britain’s fiscal crisis and were likely to add to pressure on public services.The former Bank of England rate-setter added that a migrant-driven upgrade to the UK’s population projections may not provide a long-term boost to the public finances. It came as analysis by Bloomberg suggested that rising migrant numbers could hand Jeremy Hunt £18bn for tax cuts next month by boosting the economy.Writing for the Telegraph, Mr Miles described welfare reforms that encouraged more people back to work as “unambiguously beneficial” for tax revenues, adding that a drive to get increase employment was “particularly great” for younger people suffering from mental health issues.By contrast, the Imperial College professor said it was “much less clear that persistently high levels of net immigration to boost the labour force can generate sustained fiscal improvements”, suggesting that relying on public investment or a sharp rise in productivity were also unlikely to bear fruit.Read the full report...Luxury online store Farfetch has been dealt a fresh blow as the owner of Bergdorf Goodman moved to end a partnership deal struck two years ago.The Telegraph understands that Neiman Marcus Group is pulling a tie-up with the British fashion retailer, which last month collapsed and was rescued by South Korea’s Coupang.Under the deal which was agreed in early 2022, Farfetch and Neiman Marcus had been working on improving the Bergdorf Goodman website and mobile app. Bergdorf Goodman is a well-known luxury US department store which has featured in shows including Gossip Girl.Farfetch also agreed to take a minority stake in Neiman Marcus under the 2022 agreement, investing $200m (£158m) into the business. It is understood to still hold this position.The end of the partnership comes in the wake of Coupang’s swoop on Farfetch, which saw the South Korean company buy the British fashion firm in a rescue deal after its value collapsed 99pc.The deal wiped out shareholders and many of the company’s bondholders.Bondholders have since demanded an investigation into the conduct of José Neves, the co-founder and chief executive of Farfetch.A spokesman for Neiman Marcus said the group had “decided to end its commercial partnership with Farfetch”.They added: “The Bergdorf Goodman website and app will continue to serve as the luxury ecommerce destination for its customers and will no longer be re-platforming onto Farfetch Platform Solutions... We appreciate Farfetch, which continues to be a minority investor in NMG.”A spokesperson for Farfetch said: “We continue to partner closely with thousands of brands and boutiques around the world to provide an elevated online luxury experience for millions of customers.”The FTSE 100 closed down 0.68pc.

No longer: their products are now typically on a par with German quality but at significantly lower prices. I remember being in Chongqing [in southwestern China] where the Germans built the first line on the metro system - trains, track escalators etc etc. There are now over 10 lines all built with no German input - but to the same standard. This isn’t new. It is exactly what the Japanese and South Koreans did.So Germany is losing its export markets.Mike Doe says:It remains an unfathomable mystery why Europe, and in particular Germany, has chosen to sacrifice its automotive industry and its associated jobs on the altar of net zero to benefit the Chinese Communist Party.Robert Young writes:So Germany forced into fire sale of state assets to fund its crumbling railway and road infrastructure! The glory days of the German economy are now well and truly over as it collapses into deep recession and gloom.Rob Houghton comments on the high price of German exports:German products, and especially cars, are now hugely expensive to buy. I suspect the Chinese are going to fill the gap.Joshua Tamworth says:Isn’t it strange that the elite always forecast the German economy more positively than actuals, and the UK more negatively than actuals.For something like 20 quarters in a row.You’d conclude that there’s conscious and unconscious bias towards the EU, and its positive impact on the economy.Italy’s government will offer targeted tax breaks to help farmers facing hardship, a minister told the Italian parliament on Wednesday, amid a wave of protests across continental Europe.Farmers have staged demonstrations to express their anger about low prices for produce, rising costs, cheap imports and burdens imposed by the EU’s climate change policies.The protests have eased in France and Germany for now but appear to be growing in intensity in countries such as Spain and Italy, where groups of farmers have congregated outside Rome with their tractors.The Italian government appears set to partially restore an income tax break which had been dropped in the budget law for 2024, accepting one of the farmers’ key requests.“A measure aimed at providing tax exemption for those agricultural entrepreneurs who need effective support ... is being studied,” Italian minister Luca Ciriani said.“It is clear that the main priority for this government in managing public resources is to use them to support the weakest,” added Mr Ciriani, a member of Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party.He said the tax breaks could be included in a government decree currently being examined in parliament.The US carmaker is moving away from expensive models to lure mainstream drivers, writes Melissa Lawford:Ford is to launch a range of cheap electric vehicles as it seeks to compete with Chinese manufacturers and Tesla.The US carmaker’s chief executive Jim Farley on Tuesday announced plans to move away from big, expensive electric vehicles (EVs) to lower cost models that will convince mainstream car buyers to go electric, after years of secret development in a so-called skunkworks hived off from the main business.High prices are the biggest factor holding back everyday consumers from purchasing EVs over petrol vehicles, Mr Farley said.Speaking to analysts on a conference call, he said Ford had “made a bet in silence two years ago” to start developing cheap EVs.Mr Farley said: “We’re also adjusting our capital, switching more focus onto smaller EV products.Read on to find out what Ford management is “ruthlessly focused” on...Britain’s top technology firm, Arm Holdings, is issuing its quarterly results this evening - the second since it floated in New York.The chip designer makes money by licensing designs that others manufacture, and its technology is used in electronics from companies including Apple and Samsung.The company is expected to do well from demand for artificial intelligence services, with companies such as Microsoft attracted to the energy efficiency offered by Arm processors.Sara Russo, an analyst at brokers Sanford C. Bernstein, said:We expect positive long-term value commentary around Arm-based servers and laptops, but continue to believe we will have to wait for full-year 2025 for any significant recovery in royalty rates.Arm shares are up 2.1pc in trading today.The US trade deficit narrowed in 2023 to the smallest in three years, American government data showed Wednesday, while the country imported more goods from Mexico than China for the first time in about two decades.The latest figures add to a series of positive economic news for President Joe Biden, who has been working to boost sentiment on his handling of the economy as his November reelection campaign picks up pace.For all of 2023, the overall trade gap was $773.4bn, down 18.7 percent from the $951.2bn figure in the prior year, US Commerce Department figures showed.In 2022, the country saw the biggest deficit in government data dating back to 1960.But the latest numbers showed a fall in the goods deficit last year, with imports of products dropping more than exports.Purchases of supplies like crude oil and fuel oil fell, while Americans bought less consumer goods like clothing and cell phones as well.This was partly due to the unravelling of consumption patterns during the Covid-19 pandemic, during which people cooped up at home spent on items including electronics as they worked remotely.Meanwhile, exports of services increased last year, particularly in the travel sector, and the services surplus widened.Surprisingly resilient consumption last year has helped to support the US economy, but analysts expect higher interest rates to slow consumer spending and add pressure on imports.Shares in Snap, the company behind the social media app Snapchat, have plunged 34pc today after it released disappointing results and gave an uninspiring forecast for 2024.The stock market reaction wiped $958m off chief executive Evan Spiegel’s stake in the firm.In the final quarter of 2023, revenue rose 5pc to $1.36bn in the fourth quarter of 2023, missing the $1.38bn average of analysts’ estimates and disappointing investors after strong results for the quarter from Facebook owner Meta.The company continued to lose money, posting a loss of $1.3bn, although this was at a slightly lower level than in 2023.The company is continuing to forecast losses this year, with revenue growing by 11pc to 15pc.The company pre-empted the results by announcing on Monday that it would lay off about 10pc of its workforce, amounting to about 500 employees.Mr Spiegel said: “2023 was a pivotal year for Snap, as we transformed our advertising business and continued to expand our global community, reaching 414 million daily active users.“Snapchat enhances relationships with friends, family, and the world, and this unique value proposition has provided a strong foundation to build our business for long-term growth.”That’s all from me today. My colleague Alex Singleton will keep you furnished with the latest essential updates.The boss of Sainsbury’s has refused to rule out job losses under plans to slash costs by £1bn as the chain revealed it will cut general merchandise and clothing space and expand its food offering.The UK’s second biggest supermarket unveiled a strategy update that will see it boost food space across all its near-600 supermarkets, while focusing expansion efforts on 180 of its “highest potential” sites, which will see about 10pc more space dedicated to food.But it will also cut its general merchandise and clothing offering across many shops, with between 20pc to 30pc less store space for non-food ranges in the 180 shops.The retailer suggested jobs may be in the firing line, as it said it would cut costs by £1bn over the next three years, while investing in technology and artificial intelligence (AI).Chief executive Simon Roberts refused to rule out job losses as the group plans to use AI to increase automation.He said the group would look to “protect jobs as much as possible” by being flexible and to “re-skill” and “re-deploy where we can”.Our retail editor Hannah Boland has the details.Germany has been forced to sell off some of its stake in package deliverer DHL as it struggles to improve the country’s rail network amid a budget crisis.The KfW bank, which holds the government’s remaining stakes in previously state-held companies, said it has sold 50 million shares of Deutsche Post, the name under which it still trades on the stock exchange.The €2.2bn (£1.9bn) sale, at €43.45 each, cuts the German state’s share in the company by 4pc to 16.5pc.Germany’s finance ministry said the money would be used to strengthen the capital of Germany’s main railway operator, the state-owned Deutsche Bahn, and to improve railway infrastructure.The government has been forced to turn to share sales to help finance improvements to the rail network after a court ruling forced it to plug a big hole in this year’s budget and reconsider its wider financial plans.In November, Germany’s highest court annulled a decision made by the government in 2022 to repurpose €60bn originally meant to cushion the fallout from the pandemic for measures to help combat climate change and modernise the country.Sir Sajid Javid is among the potential candidates to become the

closer to wrenching control over euro clearing back from London today after reaching a key political agreement on new clearing rules.Our reporter Michael Bow has the latest:Officials from the EU Council and the EU Parliament backed a package of measures from the European Commission forcing banks clearing euro-derivatives trading to send a minimum portion of trades through EU-based institutions.The plan is designed to reduce reliance on London as a clearing centre post-Brexit.Despite broad support in Brussels, the proposals lack specific demands on the amount of clearing needed to be provided inside the EU.More than 90pc of euro-denominated clearing is done at London’s LCH, prompting fears in Brussels about a lack of oversight from the EU.UK and EU officials are still debating rules over equivalence, which allow the UK to clear euro-denominated contracts.Carlsberg has plunged to a £4.7bn loss after the Kremlin commandeered its Russian business.Our senior business reporter Daniel Woolfson has the details:Carlsberg’s Russian business unit, Baltika Breweries, was seized by Russian authorities last year after the Danish brewer tried to sell it and exit the country.The brewer said on Tuesday that the incident resulted in the company making a loss of 40.8bn Danish krone (£4.7bn) for the year.Carlsberg employed around 8,400 people in Russia prior to the seizure, and had been looking to sell the business amid pressure on consumer brands to leave Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.Read how the seizure of Carlsberg’s Russian business comes amid a clampdown on Western-owned assets in Russia by Vladimir Putin.Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba added another $25bn (£19.8bn) to its share buyback program as it tried to reassure investors amid lower-than-expected sales revenue for the last quarter of 2023.Alibaba posted a 5pc increase in sales to 260.3bn yuan (£29bn) for the three months to December, slightly missing analyst estimates.Net income sank to 14.4bn yuan (£1.6bn), down 77pc compared to the same time last year.The Hangzhou-based business attributed the drastic drop in net income to the decrease in value of its equity investments and a decrease in income from operations due to that.Alibaba’s New York-listed stock price fell about 4pc in premarket trading following the report.Alibaba chief executive Eddie Wu said: “Our top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing.”Electric cars cannot be advertised as completely “zero emission” because of the carbon dioxide that is generated when they are made and charged, the advertising watchdog has declared.Our industry editor Matt Oliver has the details:In a ruling that will change how electric vehicles (EVs) are promoted, the Advertising Standards Authority has banned carmakers from referring to them as zero emission unless they make clear this is only while driving.The decision emerged as the regulator criticised BMW for describing its range of EVs as “zero emission cars” in Google searches.In the ruling, the ASA said: “We understood that when electric vehicles were driven no emissions were produced, unlike a car with a petrol or diesel engine where emissions came from the tailpipe.“However, in other circumstances, such as the manufacture or charging of an electric vehicle using electricity from the national grid, emissions were generated.”The ruling comes as demand for electric cars has waned.When was the last time you had a Breakaway bar? For many of you, the answer is “I have no idea” or “a very long time ago” and that is the way it is likely to stay forever.The Breakaway and Yorkie biscuit bars are to disappear from shelves following a decline in sales, maker Nestle has announced.The Yorkie Biscuit is not to be confused with Yorkie chocolate bars, which Nestle said are “staying for good”.Nestle said the chocolate-covered Breakaway will no longer be produced from March, to make way for new products.Breakaway fans can still buy the bar throughout February and March at Sainsbury’s while stocks last.The Breakaway, made with wholemeal, oat and coconut flours, was launched in 1970 by Rowntree Mackintosh before being acquired by Nestle in 1988.It follows Nestle blaming falling sales on its decision in November to discontinue the Caramac bar after 64 years.US stock indexes were subdued in premarket trading as investors grapple with uncertainty about the outlook for interest rate cuts.Ford jumped 6pc in premarket trading after the car maker increased its first-quarter dividend and decided to scale back investments in new capacity for loss-making electric vehicles. General Motors also added 1.4pc.On the flip side, Snap slumped 32.3pc after missing quarterly revenue estimates, as the Snapchat-owner struggled to compete for advertising dollars against heavyweights such as Meta and Alphabet. Peer Pinterest shed 3.8pc.Uber announced its first full-year operating profit and forecast quarterly core profit and gross bookings above estimates. However, its shares were last down 1.7pc ahead of the opening bell.Wall Street has been relatively quiet this week following a stellar performance in the months before which saw the benchmark S&P 500 hit record highs.In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc, the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq 100 was up 0.1pc.Uber secured its first full-year operating profit as its number of bookings jumped in the run-up to Christmas in what its boss said was a “standout quarter to cap off a standout year”.Operating income swung from a loss of $1.8bn (£1.4bn) to a profit of $1.1bn (£870m).Gross bookings - which includes deliver orders, ride hailing and driver earnings - grew 22pc to $37.6bn (£29.8bn) in the final three months of 2023.The number of trips and monthly active platform consumers grew 24pc and 15pc, respectively, compared to the same period the previous year.Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said:2023 was an inflection point for Uber, proving that we can continue to generate strong, profitable growth at scale.Our audiences are larger and more engaged than ever, with our platform powering an average of nearly 26 million daily trips last year.The German economy is already threatened by recession after output shrank 0.3pc in the final three months of last year.Our economics editor Szu Ping Chan analyses the backdrop for Europe’s largest economy:Analysts believe the German economy could shrink again in the current quarter as ailing manufacturers struggle to adapt to a world without cheap Russian energy after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.Stefan Schilbe, HSBC’s chief German economist, said there was “little hope for a change in trend” in the coming months.He added: “Nationwide strikes by rail and airport workers are likely to weigh on output in January and February. In addition, the global economic climate remains subdued, coupled with high geopolitical risks amid the situation in the Red Sea, high interest rates, and domestic energy prices still well above their pre-pandemic level. So German manufacturers face more of the same weakness at the beginning of this year.”The country is also struggling to deal with a property crisis driven by plunging prices and a collapse in building activity.Analysts highlighted that car production was bouncing back, though Carsten Brzeski at ING said an ongoing decline in energy-intensive production “could lengthen the process of bottoming out”.Mr Brzeski said: “Germany wouldn’t be Germany these days if there weren’t new problems weighing on the short-term outlook: strikes and supply chain disruptions as a result of the military conflict in the Red Sea have made another contraction in the German economy in the first quarter of the year even more likely.”Oil prices have edged higher after a two-day gain amid the geopolitical risk in the Middle East - and some analysts think prices could be about to shift higher.Brent crude was last up 0.6pc to tip above $79 a barrel after climbing 1.6pc over the previous two sessions, while West Texas Intermediate was up 0.6pc to just under $74.Houthi rebels said they targeted two ships in the southern Red Sea, the latest in a string of attacks that has forced a major re-routing of global trade. The US has vowed more strikes against Iranian forces and their proxies in the region.However, the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute has kept a lid on price rises for now after it said US nationwide crude inventories rose 674,000 barrels last week.Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at Swedish bank SEB, said signs of a revival in the global economy will eventually push prices higher as Saudi Arabia decides against increasing production. He said:With emerging signs of a global revival, it is very unlikely that Saudi/OPEC+ will cave in and switch from “price over volume” to “volume over price”.A potential revival implies a stronger demand impulse down the road.And if you look upon the world economy with the eyes of an optimist your take would probably be: Chinese policy has shifted focus to growth, Biden’ infrastructure stimulus package is stimulating the economy significantly, the EU is crawling out of the woods as natural gas prices have come down, India marches on, inflation globally is fading and interest rate cuts are coming.Philip Milton, public policy manager for fraud at Meta, told the Home Affairs Select Committee that the tech giant took the issue of fraud on the platform “extremely seriously”.Responding to evidence from the banking sector about large-scale fraud occurring on Facebook Marketplace, Mr Milton said fraud “fundamentally undermines the experience we’re trying to provide for people” and said this, combined with fraudulent advertising impacting trust in the company from advertisers, meant the tech giant was “directly incentivised” to do all it can to prevent criminal activity.When suggested by the committee that the evidence to MPs from the banks showed Meta was not doing all it could to prevent online fraud, Mr Milton said:I disagree with that. To give you an idea of the scale that we’re putting in place to tackle this kind of thing, since 2016 we’ve invested 20 billion dollars on safety and security, and that’s not slowing down - five billion of that was in the last year alone.We have 40,000 people working across the company on safety and security. Half of that number are involved in directly reviewing content, so we invest significantly in trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening.A quick look at the energy markets, where wholesale gas prices remain subdued as mild winter weather reduces demand for heating.Europe’s benchmark contract fell as much as 2.6pc today and was last down 0.2pc to less than €29 per megawatt hour.Prices have fallen more than 30pc since October as temperatures remained above usual levels, keeping already extra-full storage sites well stocked.The UK equivalent contract was down 0.7pc, having fallen as much as 3.2pc in early trading.The pound has risen against the dollar as the latest figures showed house prices in Britain rose at their fastest annual pace in a year - supporting bets that the Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates soon.Sterling was up 0.3pc to $1.26 as property values jumped for the fourth month in a row, according to Halifax.The pound was also up 0.2pc against the euro, which is worth 85p, as Bank of England policymaker Sarah Breeden said the next few months were “incredibly important” in assessing the impact of wages on inflation.Tumbling inflation and slowing pay growth could open the way to lower interest rates in the coming months, the Bank of England’s newest monetary policymaker has hinted.Our deputy economics editor Tim Wallace has the latest:Sarah Breeden, who joined the Monetary Policy Committee in November, said last year’s worries over the persistence of inflation have started to fade.In December “the question I was focused on was whether there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures which might mean we needed to tighten further,” she said.“As I have become more confident that persistence is likely to evolve as embodied within our forecast, I have become less concerned that rates might need to be tightened further. Instead my focus, and indeed the focus of many on the MPC, has shifted to thinking about how long rates need to remain at their current level.”Inflation stood at 4pc in December, lower than the Bank of England predicted but still twice its 2pc target.Ms Breeden said she will look for more evidence on wages and inflation before moving interest rates from their current level of 5.25pc.“The next few months will be incredibly important for my assessment of wage and price persistence, with the majority of this year’s wage setting processes set to conclude by April,” she said.Eight in 10 of the most commons financial frauds faced by consumers begin on social media, MPs have been told.Paul Davis, financial crime prevention director at TSB, told the Home Affairs Committee:The three main types of fraud that impact our customers are purchase scams, they’re the most common, although they tend to be lower value; investment scams, which are a bit less common but tend to be very high value; and impersonation scams.For those three types, which as I say are the main ones, we see about 80pc start on social media.Indeed, let’s not walk past the fact that when I say social media there, the majority of them start from the channels owned by one company in particular, which is Meta.He added: “For purchase scams, we find Facebook Marketplace is the main place where those scams originate.”Shares in Imperial Leather maker PZ Cussons have plunged after the consumer goods giant revealed it had swung to a loss, as it continues to be rocked by volatility in the Nigerian economy.The Manchester-based maker of household brands including Imperial Leather, Carex and St.Tropez said “we have clearly had our challenges” as it unveiled its half-year results.The company showed it swung to a statutory pre-tax loss of £94.2m in the six months to December, down from a profit of £40.5m the previous year.Revenues fell by nearly 18pc over the same period, from £336.9m to £277.1m.The business has a major market in Nigeria, which represents more than a third of its total sales, and has regularly stressed a prolonged slump in the value of the naira, the country’s currency, has wiped money from its sales.It said the currency is about 70pc weaker than a year ago, which represents the biggest drop in value in its history. Inflation in the region is also at a 30-year high of nearly 30pc.PZ Cussons said this led to foreign exchange losses of about £88m, dragging on its profits and sales.Shares in PZ Cussons were down as much as 20.1pc to take it to the bottom of the FTSE 250.Siemens Energy swung to a €1.6bn (£1.3bn) net profit thanks to a one-off gain from the sale of a subsidiary to its parent company.Our energy editor Jonathan Leake has the latest:The troubled German-based company, which makes wind turbines used in many UK wind farms, is recovering from a financial crisis caused partly by quality issues in some of its onshore models and partly by industry-wide inflation and supply problems.Last year those crises forced it to seek financial guarantee from the German government for some of its projects.Siemens Energy has become a vital part of the UK wind industry. It owns a turbine blade factory in Hull that employs 1,200 people and which supplies many of the windfarms being built around the UK. Overall the company employs 6,000 people in the UK.President and chief executive Christian Bruch said the company was getting back on course.He said: “The solid first quarter is encouraging... our focus remains on solving the quality problems in our onshore wind business and making the most of the growth potential for the rest of the company.”Pandora, the world’s biggest jewellery maker, said its performance since the start of the year has been “healthy” with high single-digit sales growth, as it announced a share buyback programme after a strong run.Pandora, which sells charm bracelets, has been a rare bright spot among retailers and brands targeting aspirational consumers with affordable luxury items.The company aims for organic revenue growth of 6pc-9pc in 2024, after reporting strong sales of its silver charms and bracelets which have helped its share price to more than double since the start of last year.Soren Lontoft Hansen, senior analyst at Sydbank, said: “Despite the worldwide macroeconomic uncertainties… the company is manoeuvring strongly and better than the market.”The growth target is in line with a goal set in October for a 7-9pc compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2026.Pandora also announced a share buyback programme of up to 4 billion Danish krona (£457.1m), and a dividend of 18 Danish crowns per share. Its shares rose 0.5pc at the open.UK shares have edged downwards in early trading amid a a sell-off in precious mining stocks and uncertainty over interest rate cuts.The blue-chip FTSE 100 was down 0.2pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 index was flat.It was a good start for housebuilders after house prices rose at their the strongest annual rate in a year last month, adding to tentative signs of momentum in the property market.Developers across the FTSE 100 and 250 gained as much as 1.7pc before settling at gains of 0.1pc as a merger between Barratt and Redrow was also announced.Barratt Developments shares dropped as much as 8.9pc to the bottom of the FTSE 100 while Redrow shares climbed as much as 16.7pc to the peak of the FTSE 250.However, markets were dragged down by precious metal miners, which shed as much as 1.2pc on lower gold prices, ahead of speeches by Federal Reserve officials through the week.Soap maker PZ Cussons forecast a lower annual profit and slashed its interim dividend, sending its shares as much as 16.6pc lower to the bottom of FTSE 250.Analysts have been bashing away at their keyboards to make sense of Barratt’s takeover of rival housebuilder Redrow.Quilter Cheviot property fund research analyst Oli Creasey said:By some measures, Barratt is already the largest public housebuilder in the UK. It isn’t the most valuable company by market cap, but the volume of houses built in the past year is ahead of any of its peers.So we wouldn’t categorise this transaction as a need to build scale. However, there is likely to be a some element of cost synergies to be harvested as a result of combining two companies in the same industry, and a limited amount of geographical overlap.Looking at share prices, the deal is an attractive one for Redrow shareholders, who get a boost to the undisturbed share price, and become holders in a much larger business.It is less clear what the advantage is for Barratt, although given the structure of the deal, there’s limited downside – the all-share deal means that no cash needs to change hands, and the balance sheet strength is unchanged.It should also be noted that at a price equal to 1.2x Redrow’s NAV, it isn’t a particularly expensive price being paid, and will create the undisputed largest public housebuilder in the UK.German industrial production fell for a seventh straight month, official data showed, marking its longest series of declines since the period after reunification in the early 1990s.Output plunged by 1.6pc in December compared to the previous month, federal statistics agency Destatis said, following a revised 0.2pc fall in November.The drop was far worse than the 0.35pc decline predicted by analysts at FactSet and caps the longest run of falls since 1993.Melanie Debono at Pantheon Macroeconomics described the figures as “ugly”, adding: “The recession in industry will continue this quarter.”The sharper-than-expected decline was driven by steep falls in the chemical industry and the construction sector. The car industry meanwhile saw a 4pc rise in production.For the whole of 2023, industrial output was 1.5pc lower than a year earlier, Destatis said, and still below pre-pandemic levels.Germany’s crucial industrial sector, which used to be heavily reliant on cheap Russian gas imports, has been reeling ever since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine pushed energy costs higher.Higher interest rates and weaker export demand have added to the economic headwinds, as its economy shrank by 0.3pc last year.Capital Economics economist Franziska Palmas said that industry “remains a significant drag on growth”.She added: “We expect this to continue throughout 2024.”Die reale #Produktion im Produzierenden Gewerbe ist Dezember 2023 gegenüber November 2023 voraussichtlich um 1,6 % gesunken. Im Gesamtjahr 2023 lag sie um 1,5 % unter dem Vorjahr. Mehr Infos in unserer Pressemitteilung: https://t.co/je5sVbRi2p pic.twitter.com/t3Qtpnn5w0— Statistisches Bundesamt (@destatis) February 7, 2024Orsted, one of the UK’s major wind farm builders and operators, has been forced to halt dividend payments and pull out of several global markets as it deals with a cash crisis.Our energy editor Jonathan Leake has the details:The company, which operates 12 UK windfarms, is also pulling of of several international markets, including Norway, spain and Portugal and cutting back its US operations.The crisis is linked to the company’s decision to pull out of several uncompleted projects, planned off the east coast of the USA.It halted development of its Ocean 1 wind farm off New Jersey after incurring losses of £2.3bn. It also cancelled Ocean 2, also off the New Jersey coast, where construction was planned to start in 2028.The company recorded losses of 20.2bn Danish Kroner - about £2.2bn. This was despite operating profits of 19bn Danish kroner - about £2.2bn.TotalEnergies has reported the highest profit in its history - but still missed analyst expectations despite outperforming peers like Shell and BP.The French company said profit came in at $21.4bn (£17bn) in 2023, an increase of 4pc on the previous year but below predictions of $23.7bn.Its bottom line put the French energy conglomerate ahead of Shell, BP, Exxon-Mobil and Chevron, which all reported lower earnings in the face of weaker energy prices.However, TotalEnergies’s 2022 net profit had been weighed down by a huge exceptional charge - $15bn - from its withdrawal from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.Once non-recurring items were stripped out, profits suffered a sharp downturn last year, with adjusted net profit falling 36pc to $23.2bn.Oil and gas prices dropped some 10pc on average last year from 2022 when spiking oil prices had boosted earnings at energy companies worldwide.Chairman Patrick Pouyanne called the results “robust”, saying in a statement they had been achieved in “an uncertain environment”. Hydrocarbons had performed well, he said.It has been a mixed story for the shares of Barratt and Redrow after the announcement of their merger.Barratt shares have slipped 3.7pc - perhaps as shareholders bulk at the idea of holding 67.2pc of a combined company.Meanwhile, Redrow shares have surged by as much as 17pc after recommending the takeover, which values the business at £2.5bn.Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:The economic winds have not been kind to the housebuilders and Barratt Developments and Redrow clearly believe they’ll be stronger together, giving the new combined company much bigger clout to capitalise on the structural need for housing in the UK.Redrow’s share price has struggled to regain its pre-pandemic form and with Barratt enjoying a strong balance sheet and hefty cash reserves it clearly decided the time was right to make a move.Clearly market conditions are still going to be tougher while interest rates stay elevated.However, the latest signs are that recovery is underway, with the Halifax house price index pointing to renewed sentiment among buyers, as better mortgage deals have landed.The FTSE 100 opened higher following large gains on Wall Street and after Chinese regulators issued another set of market-enhancing policies.The UK’s blue chip index began the day up 0.1pc to 7,688.72 while the midcap FTSE 250 rose 0.2pc to 19,208.63.Sainsbury’s has unveiled plans to overhaul its supermarkets with a focus on creating more food space and revealed aims to slash costs by £1bn over the next three years.The UK’s second biggest supermarket chain said it would cut its general merchandise offering and clothing offering across many sites to create more space for food and ensure it is offering full grocery ranges in more stores.In its strategy update, the group said it will also “tighten the focus” of its non-food ranges, while adding there would be more changes for its Argos store estate, having already shut a raft of sites to bring many within supermarkets since it bought the retailer.The new plan - called Next Level Sainsbury’s - will see it cut costs by £1bn over the next three years, focusing on technology investments to deliver automation and savings.The increase in house prices for a fourth month in a row puts Britain about halfway towards a 3pc increase in house prices this year already, according to economists.Andrew Wishart, senior property economist at Capital Economics, said:The Halifax index has a track record of being quick to respond to changes in mortgage rates, so the large increases of 1.1pc in December and 1.3pc in January reflect the swift drop in the average quoted mortgage rate from 5pc in November to about 4.5pc in January.Fixed mortgage rates are unlikely to fall any further in the near term, which will restrain future monthly gains in the Halifax index.As the increase mirrored a large rise in the Nationwide index for the same month, there is little doubt that house prices made a strong start to the year.He added: “While we doubt that will continue (prices would rise by over 10pc this year if it did), our non-consensus call that house prices will rise this year looks like the right one.”The tie-up between Barratt and Redrow is expected to eventually lead to savings of at least £90m a year, the companies said.It comes as British housebuilders recover from the worst downturn since the financial crisis as high property prices and mortgage rates triggered a slump in sales last year.Last summer house price falls in July were more widespread than at any point since 2009, according to Rics’ UK residential market survey of estate agents.Redrow chief executive Matthew Pratt said:Redrow and Barratt combined creates a leading UK homebuilder.Together, we’ll be in a much better position to offer a broader range of high-quality and energy efficient homes to customers.He added: “The Redrow brand, with its premium, characterful homes, has an excellent reputation and will remain a key part of the Combined Group. As with Barratt, Redrow’s fifty-year success story is based on its people, products and supply chain partners. Both businesses are a great fit and there are many exciting opportunities to innovate and share knowledge across a range of different areas.”House builder Barratt will merge with its rival developer Redrow as the sector consolidates after the downturn caused by high interest rates.Barratt said it will buy the entire issued and to be issued share capital of its rival as part of the deal, creating a combined group which will be renamed as Barratt Redrow.The merger deal will offer Redrow shareholders 1.44 of new Barratt shares at a premium of 27.2pc, valuing the developer at £2.5bn.Once the takeover is complete, Redrow shareholders will hold approximately 32.8pc of the combined group and Barratt shareholders will hold approximately 67.2pc.Barratt chief executive David Thomas said the combined businesses “would leverage the respective strengths of both Barratt and Redrow, delivering significant benefits to our people, our supply chains, and - most importantly - our customers”.Redrow founder Steve Morgan added that Barratt is a home builder he has “long admired,” while chief executive Matthew Pratt said the combined companies “creates a leading UK homebuilder”House prices rose last month as falling mortgage rates increased the number of potential buyers, according to an industry survey.Property values increased by 1.3pc in January compared to the previous month, according to the Halifax house price index.It was the fourth monthly gain in a row after six consecutive falls before that.The survey found that average house prices increased to £291,029, which was £3,900 more than last month.Compared to the same month last year, property prices grew by 2.5pc, which was the highest annual growth since January 2023.Halifax Mortgages director Kim Kinnaird said:The recent reduction of mortgage rates from lenders as competition picks up, alongside fading inflationary pressures and a still-resilient labour market has contributed to increased confidence among buyers and sellers. This has resulted in a positive start to 2024’s housing market.However, while housing activity has increased over recent months, interest rates remain elevated compared to the historic lows seen in recent years and demand continues to exceed supply.For those looking to buy a first home, the average deposit raised is now £53,414, around 19pc of the purchase price. It’s not surprising that almost two thirds (63pc) of new buyers getting a foot on the ladder are now buying in joint names.Looking ahead, affordability challenges are likely to remain and further modest falls should not be ruled out, against a backdrop of broader uncertainty in the economic environment.Thanks for joining me. House prices increased for a fourth month in a row following the recent reduction in mortgage rates from lenders, according to the latest Halifax house price index.Average house prices increased to £291,029, which was £3,900 more than last month.1) Lockdown generation lacks basic workplace skills, says City grandee | Employers have noticed the negative impact on young recruits of lockdown measures, according to Baroness McGregor-Smith2) Bank of England pushed Britain into recession, economists say | Threadneedle Street has refused to communicate interest rates plan, economists say3) Why resurgent Ireland can’t afford to reunite – yet | Financial burden of absorbing the North could weigh down Dublin’s buoyant economy4) AI will trigger global surge in gas demand, says BP boss | Boom in tools such as ChatGPT means data centres require more power5) Jeremy Warner: The cost of lockdown is still becoming more devastating by the day | Young Britons will continue to pay the price of lost education for a generation to comeAsian stocks firmed on Wednesday as investors waited to see if Beijing’s increasingly frantic efforts to prop up its sagging share markets would actually work, while bonds enjoyed a reprieve from recent selling.In recent days, China’s regulators have announced further curbs on short selling and state investors said they were expanding their stock buying plans.Bloomberg News also reported President Xi Jinping would discuss the stock market with financial regulators, though there was no confirmation this had happened or what was discussed.However, the jury is very much out on how effective all this will prove and the blue chip index inched up 0.4% in choppy early trade, while Shanghai stocks added 0.9%.Tokyo’s blue-chip Nikkei shares drifted lower as investors digested corporate earnings.The benchmark Nikkei 225 index eased 0.1pc, or 40.74 points, to end at 36,119.92, while the broader Topix index added 0.4pc, or 10.70 points, at 2,549.95.Wall Street drifted higher during a quiet Tuesday as the bond market calmed down following some sharp swings.The S&P 500 rose 0.2pc, to 4,954.23, and nearly returned to its all-time high set at the end of last week.

Options Trader Wagers That Meta Shares Will Double Again`(Bloomberg) -- An options trader appears to be looking to parlay a winning bet on Meta Platforms Inc. into an even bigger windfall if the tech giant doubles — again — in the next 18 months.Most Read from BloombergHaley Loses Nevada Primary to ‘None of These Candidates’ OptionChina Replaces Top Markets Regulator as Xi Tries to End RoutTesla Asks Which Jobs Are Critical, Stoking Layoff FearsUS Commercial Real Estate Contagion Is Now Moving to EuropeTrump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals CourtEarly Wednesday, a trader sold a block of 19,000 call options that expire in June 2025 and allow the holder to purchase 1.9 million shares at $600, in exchange for twice as many calls with a $950 strike price expiring a year later, collecting $11.4 million.Holders of call options in Meta and other megacap tech stocks have seen ballooning profits, both from the increase in share prices that makes the options more valuable, but also the seeming unquenchable demand from investors looking to bet on further gains. Unlike most stocks, where there is a pronounced premium for bearish option contracts versus bullish as investors look to protect against losses, the incessant tech rally has flipped that on its head.“Meta is an example of a stock with skew to the calls,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group, adding that it’s rare to see this in an large cap equity and is an indication of “panic to the upside.”Selling the earlier calls — which appear to have been bought in mid-July when Meta was trading around $309 a share — likely netted millions of dollars in profits, though it’s hard to be sure as the position may have been rolled in July from an even lower level as shares rallied.While $950 seems like a far-away level, Meta shares doubled from November 2022 to March 2023, and doubled again between then and January.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went WrongThe Story Elon Musk Doesn’t Want to Talk AboutLayoffs Show That Tech Jobs Aren’t Sacred AnymoreHSBC’s New ‘Wise Killer’ App Vies for FX CustomersThe Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

Why Snap (SNAP) Stock Is Nosediving`Shares of social network Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) fell 34.5% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and average revenue per user (ARPU) missing analysts' expectations amid elevated expectations around changes in the direct response business. User growth was steady, with DAU (daily active users) ahead of estimates as net additions in Europe and the Rest of the World more than offset the customer attrition recorded in North America. This North America attrition is sure to ring alarm bells about competition, with Meta (NASDAQ:META) recently reporting very encouraging results.While next quarter's revenue guidance was in line, adjusted EBITDA guidance was well below. This shows that Snap's growth is coming at higher costs or less efficiency than expected. Moreover, the ARPU miss and the weakness in North America DAU indicate a challenging road ahead if the company aims to surpass expectations in the upcoming quarter. During the earnings call, management hinted at potential growth investments in North America and Europe and expressed optimism about avoiding further declines in North America in Q1. Overall, this was a mediocre quarter for Snap as the market was likely expecting more, considering the strong result reported by Meta earlier in the season.The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Snap? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.Snap's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 26 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Snap and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company gained 7.1% on the news that Meta reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector also suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024.Snap is down 29.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $11.33 per share it is trading 35.1% below its 52-week high of $17.45 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Snap's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,326.Do you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners`"In this article, we discuss 10 best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners. Global stocks reached their highest point in over two years, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record high on February 7, as per Reuters. This was driven by robust earnings, which helped counter concerns surrounding US regional banks and the Chinese markets. Bonds experienced slight pressure, as statements from Federal Reserve officials reinforced the expectation that the central bank might not reduce interest rates in the near future. According to Arthur Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth: ""We are at the midpoint of the 4Q earnings reporting season, and we would say that there has been more good news than bad.""In 2023, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 26.29%, recovering from the setback of 18.11% in 2022. In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts. The potential combination of declining interest rates and earnings growth is seen as a positive for stocks. However, analysts express worries about overvalued technology sector stocks, and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to introduce significant market volatility.Looking at historical data from 1921 to 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research, noted that the average S&P 500 bull market has yielded a return of 157% and lasted over four years. This historical pattern suggests the possibility of the stock market rally continuing in the foreseeable future. One notable success in the current bull market has been the performance of artificial intelligence technology as an investment theme. AI stocks were among the top performers in 2023, contributing to the market's overall positive trajectory. James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, commented: “The market’s recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI.” On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee suggests a more cautious outlook for 2024, anticipating an average year for markets rather than double-digit gains. Concerns include the S&P 500's elevated forward price/earnings ratio and a historically low equity risk premium. Valuations indicate potential sub-par annual stock returns, with estimates pointing to a 4% gain compared to the long-run average of 7%-8%. Analysts' optimistic projections for 2024 U.S. corporate earnings are questioned, with expectations of a tapering in economic growth from 7% to 4%. The market's assumption of a more aggressive Fed rate-cutting stance contrasts with public signals, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions as emergency programs wind down in 2024.Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, remarked: “As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.” Some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology For this list, we used a stock screener and selected stable companies with high single digit or low-teens revenue growth. Then, we arranged them via market cap to get the largest companies. We selected the top stocks for beginners based on revenue growth and hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter of 2023.

The Company reported double-digit revenue, operating earnings and earnings per share growth during their third quarter. The Company has been able to adjust pricing in its health care segment to keep up with medical cost inflation while working with its Optum units to deliver more value-based care that replaces the traditional fee for service health care model. Value-based care is a sensible, long-term growth opportunity for the Company to pursue and also differentiates it from the vast majority of healthcare providers, particularly as it relates to Medicare patients. For example, the Company’s value-based care programs provide more preventative care opportunities and home-based care visits for patients which helps save the U.S. healthcare system billions in unnecessary spending while also providing patients with better outcomes, as diseases and behaviors are caught or corrected at earlier stages. The Company has invested in several core assets over many years to execute this value-based strategy and it will become the standard of care as the proportion of people in the U.S. with healthcare insurance coverage continues to reach new highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.00%JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, anticipating $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi suggested that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) may intentionally be underestimating, and the company's CEO expressed confidence in surpassing the $3.5 billion figure for this year. The analyst estimated that AMD could generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from its MI300, according to buy-side investors' expectations.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion. White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.60%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), a diversified software company, operates globally through three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.30%Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM), same as the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with roughly 15 million shares worth $4 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) ranks 6th on our list of the top cheap stocks for beginners in 2024. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners.  Suggested articles:Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks15 Best Bitcoin Wallets For iPhone and Android11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:48:57.200197`AMZN
Do Not Fight this Market: 3 Top Ranked Stock to Join the Rally`After such a strong finish in 2023 and follow through at the start of 2024, investors are wondering when the correction is coming. While it is natural to expect some sort of pull-back I think investors would be best off not trying to predict, and instead continue buying top-ranked stocks.Below we can see the Nasdaq 100 is breaking out of this bullish looking consolidation, and the S&P 500 is very nearly pushing through the 5,000 level.Image Source: TradingViewFurthermore, there are many powerful investment themes keeping the markets bid, including a robust economy, exciting technological developments, and tremendous government spending deficits. That last item is definitely worth considering when wondering when the economy is going to slowdown.Because of the massive spending behind the most recent infrastructure bill, where more than $1 trillion is going to be spent, many laid off workers are likely to be soaked up by the public sector, and spending to continue.Based on these influential economic developments, investors should focus on continuing to buy leading stocks with top Zacks ranks, because a major economic slowdown is becoming less and less likely.Here I will share three stocks with top Zacks ranks, and market beating performance over the last month. I particularly like to look for stocks showing relative strength while the market continues to grind higher.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMercadoLibreMercadoLibre MELI, is the Latin-American version of Amazon, building an e-commerce platform that continues to boom in popularity. MercadoLibre has been one of the most exciting stocks in the last few years and its returns continue to delight investors willing to own shares.In addition to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, the company is forecasting impressive growth in sales and earnings.This year, sales are expected to climb 36% YoY to $14.3 billion, while EPS are set to expand 134% to $22.30 per share. That growth is projected to continue on to the next year as well, with sales expected to grow 22.3% the following year, and EPS to increase 57.6%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to the fundamental developments in MercadoLibre, its technical advances are compelling as well. In addition to relative strength against the market, it has been forming a very nice technical trade pattern to measure a breakout trade from.For investors waiting for a technical signal to enter MELI, a move above $1764 would market a clean breakout from this bullish consolidation.Image Source: TradingViewStoneCoStoneCo STNE is a Brazilian financial technology company specializing in payment processing solutions. Founded in 2012, StoneCo provides a range of services, including electronic payments, credit card processing, and point-of-sale technology for businesses of varying sizes.StoneCo has seen earnings estimates steadily trend higher over the last 10 months, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Additionally, the company is entering a period where EPS are expected to expand significantly. Earnings are forecast to grow 167% YoY this year, and 36.1% next year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MercadoLibre, StoneCo stock is forming a convincing technical pattern. STNE stock was hit hard at the end of 2022 and traded sideways at a depressed level for nearly two years.However, at the end of 2023, the stock initiated a stage one breakout, indicating investors had been buying the depressed stock. Now over the last two months, STNE price action has built out a weekly bull flag, leading me to believe another big breakout is coming.If STNE stock trades above the $18.50 level, investors could rush in to buy the stock sending it significantly higher.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon.comFinally, one of the world's leading companies, Amazon AMZN just reported an incredibly strong quarter of financials sending the stock much higher.Following the earnings gap up, Amazon stock is forming a post earnings consolidation, a very high probability trading setup. Above $171 and AMZN should make a run at its all-time high.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon has also been garnering interest from analysts, who have been steadily upgrading earnings estimates. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 22% and current quarter earnings by 12.5%.Earnings at the e-commerce and technology giant are expected to grow by an impressive 28.1% annually over the next 3-5 years, driven by its AWS and new advertising business segments.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe great thing about investing in stocks is that the best ones offer tremendous asymmetric opportunities. There is no reason to try and predict market selloffs, because so long as you focus on buying top-tier securities, the returns take care of themselves. That is not to say that risk management isn’t key, but good investors are often optimists. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Down 61% in the Past Year, Has This E-Commerce Stock Entered Bargain Territory?`The last 12 months were a good period in general for e-commerce stocks. Companies like Amazon, Shopify, MercadoLibre, and Pinduoduo saw their share prices rise at least 30%.But the industry had its laggards too, including JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), which saw its shares fall 61% in the past year. With the stock now down 78% from its all-time high, JD.com has attracted some investors looking to take advantage of a potential bargain.But before you rush into the stock, you should understand how JD.com got here in the first place. Only then can you make an informed investment decision.JD.com is one of the more successful companies replicating Amazon's playbook.The e-commerce giant operates a first-party e-commerce business in China by selling a wide range of products directly to customers. It also operates a third-party marketplace that allows other sellers on its platform, in exchange for fees from each successful transaction.The company emphasizes low prices to encourage customers to buy more over time, and it operates a complex logistics service to offer speedy deliveries. The low prices and fast delivery leads to strong customer retention and sales growth, providing JD.com with the scale needed to drive prices even lower and continuously improve its service.Customers love the approach, which explains the company's uninterrupted growth for many years. For perspective, revenue grew revenue at a compound annual rate of 27% from 2017 to 2021. Everything seemed to be moving in the right direction until recently.Investors accustomed to such an impressive track record were disappointed when the e-commerce company reported just 10% revenue growth in 2022. Subsequent months were even more challenging for the company with revenue growth declining to just 2% in Q3 2023. Revenue from its flagship first-party e-commerce business actually fell 1% year over year, masked by a 13% increase in service revenue.To add salt to the wound, competitor PDD Holdings reported 94% top-line growth in the same quarter. Even Alibaba, which is facing its own challenges, reported 9% growth.JD.com is failing to keep up with the competition. It didn't help that previous CEO Xu Lei stepped down from his post in May 2023 after just one year, adding another layer of uncertainty to the company's future.The silver lining here is the fact the company is still profitable with a strong balance sheet. JD.com generated 39 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in free cash flow in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2023. It also had 242 billion yuan ($33.2 billion) in cash and short-term investments. With this solid financial position, JD.com can continue to invest in areas like live-streaming shopping, supply chain improvements, and other initiatives.Still, investors should be aware the path ahead remains challenging as it will have to outmaneuver rivals like Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and Douyin.So JD.com is at a crossroads. Despite its previous success, the future is far less certain now that it faces a more competitive industry and greater regulatory scrutiny.Given the recent bearish sentiment, JD.com stock trades at a significant discount to other e-commerce companies with a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is just 10.2, while Pinduoduo trades at 27.8 times earnings.Investors should monitor JD.com's rebound efforts in the coming quarters for clues of its progress. If the company can defend its position as a top three e-commerce platform in China and rekindle growth, its current stock price should prove to be a bargain.Should you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?Before you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JD.com wasn’t one of them.

3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now`"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is off to a great start in 2024. The e-commerce giant is making progress along all fronts of its multifaceted business, and its stock is up 66% over the past year.You might not realize that it's still trading below all-time highs. But the way things are going, Amazon stock is likely to surpass that in the coming months, and now is a great time to buy it.Here are three specific reasons to be confident about Amazon stock this year.Amazon made a strategic decision last year to restructure its distribution network from a national one to a regional one. The rationale was that the national network was large and cumbersome, making it take longer, on average, to get products to customers. A regional network stocked with high-selling items would get products to customers faster and at a lower cost.It now has eight regional distribution centers, and the results speak for themselves. In the 2023 fourth quarter, Amazon delivered 65% more items overnight than in the prior year. CEO Andy Jassy noted that as Amazon fulfills orders faster, customers choose it for more orders.In a first since 2018, Amazon has decreased its per-unit cost to fulfill globally, and in the U.S., fulfillment cost per unit decreased by more than $0.45 from last year. This allows Amazon to expand its selection profitably at lower average selling prices, improving its chances of gaining market share.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud services arm. Until recently, AWS sales were reliable to grow at rates around 35% in a typical quarter. That began to drop when inflation became severe, and client businesses started to cut their budgets.However, Amazon continues to lead the industry with 32% of the overall market according to Statista, and sales growth improved in the fourth quarter to 13% year over year. Jassy said the company is seeing larger deals accelerate; it announced several new deals with companies like Salesforce, BMW, and Nvidia.The company launched a robust suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services for AWS, and adoption rates are strong. The company offers three layers of AI to meet the varied needs of its clients, from the most customizable to partially customizable, with the top layer being a generative AI ""coded companion."" Last week, Amazon launched Rufus, a personal shopping generative AI application that takes customer queries and offers product recommendations based on requirements.Jassy said Amazon will continue to invest heavily in AI since it offers the opportunity to revolutionize the shopping and processing experience for its customers, and it sees this as a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years.Amazon only started to break out advertising as its own business segment in late 2021, when it grew 32% year over year, trailing AWS at 40%. With the other businesses slowing down, advertising has become the fastest-growing reporting segment, increasing 26% over last year in the 2023 fourth quarter. That was driven by sponsored ads.Advertising is a no-brainer for Amazon third-party sellers since it exposes them to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers. Amazon's top AI helps them target potential buyers with high accuracy.Amazon recently changed its streaming program to an ad-supported track, like Netflix and Walt Disney, which should pump up this segment even more. This will likely remain a strong business for Amazon in the near term, and as advertisers revisit their budgets after inflation-induced cuts, they're liable to spend more. Some percentage of that will go to Amazon.These are only part of the story. Amazon is making strides in smaller endeavors like cashierless stores, healthcare, and more. 2024 could be a banner year for Amazon, and in the long term, it's likely to add value to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks`"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 5 Stocks.Jim Cramer said in a latest program that after listening to the Fed chair Jerome Powell he believes we are at ""crossroads"" since there is still ""some inflation"" and the ""dichotomy"" of hard landing versus soft landing is being ""replaced by no landing."" Cramer said that we are ""back to reality"" and the reality, according to Cramer, is that interest rates are still ""not that high."" Cramer believes the rates are at a level where the economy can keep working. Cramer wondered how and why the Fed would cut interest rates when strong employment numbers keep coming and inflation is also not going down significantly.Jim Cramer tried to convince his viewers to invest in the stock market and said that while it would seem ""reckless"" to invest in the stock market because of the risks involved, it would be ""too late"" to invest in stocks once the Fed begins to cut interest rates. Jim Cramer said that stocks are in a win-win situation. If the economy keeps growing and the market remains strong, stocks will go up. If the economy begins to slow down, the Fed would cut rates sometime in the future, causing a rally in the stock market. Jim Cramer, however, acknowledged that stocks are risky when compared to the steady 5% income on CDs.Cramer said ""great"" stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can give you that ""5% from CDs"" in ""a week or even a day.""Cramer said that he has ""no illusions"" and he is convinced that now is the right time to buy stocks. Cramer said he thinks many investors would be inclined towards investing in low-risk index funds or parking their cash in CDs or treasuries but he thinks big money will be made by investing in individual stocks.But Jim Cramer is not bullish on all stocks. In fact over the past couple of years or so he's become quite selective in his choices and keeps recommending investors to sell or stay away from low-quality, money-losing or risky stocks and instead buy best of breed and high quality stocks.In this article we will talk about some stocks Cramer is bearish on.MethodologyFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to either stay away from or sell. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment where available. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/ASports and outdoor equipment company Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) recently went public in an IPO that fell short of expectations. Cramer had advised investors to stay away from the stock. He said:“So far, this is looking like another out of favor IPO, even if its lowball price allowed the stock to get a like, I guess you could call it a decent pop. And, I’ve got to tell you, Amer Sports is a great example of the kind of deals I wish we weren’t seeing.”One of the reasons why Cramer is bearish on Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) is the company's high exposure to China.While Cramer is bearish on the stock, Canadian billionaire Chip Wilson, who also founded Lululemon Athletica, bought $324 million worth of shares at the company’s IPO.While Cramer is bearish on companies like Amer Sports, he's recommending buying high-quality mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 9Last month, Jim Cramer was asked about Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC). Cramer recommended the questioner to ""take a pass"" on the stock. Cramer said the ""greatest inventor of our time"" Elon Musk does not like lithium companies and he is trying to figure out a way to cut our dependence on them. Cramer said he would not go against Musk.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Surgical facilities company Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on these days. When asked about Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) in a recent program on CNBC, Cramer said ""that industry is in up and down right now.""""I'm taking a hard pass,"" Cramer said of Surgery Partners.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The biggest stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is owned by Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $157 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22Jim Cramer in a recent program said he hasn’t ""liked Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) in 20 years, and it’s really rewarded my dislike.""Cramer said instead of Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) he's ""willing"" to recommend Verizon.Insider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 22 hedge funds had stakes in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD). The biggest stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) is owned by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP which owns a $37 million stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24Gene editing platform company CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) ranks sixth in our list of stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from.While Cramer said that he ""likes"" CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), the reason why he cannot recommend the stock is that CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) has been losing a lot of money. Cramer said he cannot recommend CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) stock on a ""fundamental basis.""The stock has gained about 17% over the past one year. Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) said the US FDA approved its groundbreaking gene editing therapy, Casgevy, developed with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) for those aged 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT).Unlike Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Cramer likes a lot, the CNBC host is bearish on CRSP.

3 Inspiring Underdogs That Fought Tech Giants and Won`"When it comes to success in emerging industries, size usually matters. Pioneers often fail, leaving behind the foundation for larger players to dominate. Thankfully for investors in mold-breaking upstarts, it doesn't always play out that way.Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Sonos (NASDAQ: SONO), and Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) are three companies that saw Apple and other consumer tech behemoths try to take them out. The little guys are not just surviving, but thriving against established titans with almost limitless resources. Take a bow Roku, Sonos, and Spotify.Roku founder Anthony Wood invented the digital video recorder, but it was another company that enjoyed the DVR glory. He got it right when he launched Roku a few years later, pioneering the streaming video revolution. It wasn't long before Roku was joined by some of the most valuable companies on the planet. Apple TV, Alphabet's Google Chromecast, and Amazon's Fire TV hit the market. Roku didn't flinch.Roku remains the leading operating system for smart TVs in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It has roughly double the market share of its closest rival. It doesn't matter that Google and Amazon are willing to practically give away the hardware to get folks connected. Roku has been able to sacrifice product margins, knowing it can make it up in volume.Roku is free to use, making the lion's share of its revenue from ad sharing and referrals. It's working. Average revenue per user is more than $41 over the past year. There are 75.8 million active accounts on the platform, and boy are they active. Roku users are spending an average of 3.8 hours a day streaming through the Roku hub.It doesn't seem possible. Roku is competing against Apple, a company that is used to getting people to pay a premium for its wares. Alphabet is the global leader in online advertising, putting it in the perfect position to cash in on an ad-supported industry. Amazon is the top dog in online retail, and it aggressively promotes its Fire TV dongles and smart TVs on its platform. Roku is still beating them all.Roku's enemies are also rivals of Sonos. It was 2005 when Sonos rolled out the first wireless multiroom speaker system, which streams audio seamlessly through a home. Audiophiles flocked to Sonos, but then familiar foes emerged. Apple, Amazon, and Google all had cheap smart speakers in support of their virtual assistant technologies. Sonos was in their crosshairs if they chose to go upmarket, but they missed.Sonos would go on to deliver 17 consecutive years of revenue growth before proving mortal in fiscal 2023. On Tuesday afternoon it posted financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. It was a well-received report.Revenue declined 9%, or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. It's not pretty, but analysts were bracing for a 13% decline. The bigger surprise is at the other end of the income statement. Profitability improved at Sonos, earning $0.64 a share for the seasonally potent holiday quarter, up from $0.57 a share a year earlier. Wall Street pros were settling for a sharp decline to $0.39 a share.""Despite the challenging environment, we are winning in the market and outperforming the competition,"" CEO Patrick Spence said in this week's earnings report.Rich in cash and patents, Sonos is well positioned to continue dominating its high-end niche. With analyst profit targets now likely headed higher, Sonos is cheap.Remember when everyone figured that Spotify was toast? The Swedish audio streaming service was making waves worldwide, but would it be able to succeed in the U.S. as Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Amazon Music flooded the market? It's doing pretty well, even if it had to go through three rounds of layoffs last year.There are 602 million mostly ad-supported monthly active users, a 23% increase over the past year. Getting folks to pay is the more difficult nut to crack, but Spotify has been beefing up its catalog of original content to go with its industry-leading music platform. Premium Spotify accounts have risen 15% over the past year to reach 236 million.Apple and Amazon are distant competitors.

How Twitter's descent into chaos is paving the way for a new web`"The post-Twitter era has spurred the development and further growth of numerous social networks that prioritize brief posts, from open source standbys like Mastodon to new decentralized concepts like Bluesky, and those from smaller startups like Post, Spill, and Spoutible, to those from tech giants like Meta, which launched the Twitter-like Threads. While this is great news for people looking for a new place to land after Twitter's demise (the network under Elon Musk is now called X and headed in a different direction), it's a challenge for early adopters who want to experiment with new apps and services.Not everyone is satisfied with X's current course. Though a top-ranked app today, it's not the Twitter of years past. X takes a lax approach to content moderation, leaving advertisers and some users in search of new options. Even its owner dabbles in antisemitism and trolling, prompting more of the same from the user base. As top advertisers fled, X's ads became worse and more spammy.Elon Musk says ‘go f*ck yourself’ to advertisers leaving XThe changes at X have been swift and troublesome, leading to a flurry of activity in the social sphere as X alternatives emerged. But now there's too much of a good thing.The Twitter diaspora, so to speak, is hungry for a solution to save them from having to browse content from across half a dozen apps, in addition to the news websites, blogs, and other information sources they already consume while online.That problem is now being addressed by another group of developers -- those who aren't trying to re-create Twitter or improve upon it, but solve the problem of there being ""too many Twitters"" to keep up with.Last week, we reported on Tapestry, a new project from The Iconfactory, the app development shop best known for its work on the early Twitter client Twitterrific. Recently funded on Kickstarter after only showing off its prototype build, Tapestry aims to offer a unified app for tracking social media, news, and RSS feeds in one place. That includes posts from X, Bluesky, Mastodon, Tumblr, and others in the future, like perhaps Threads.The Iconfactory was only looking to raise $100,000 to start development of the new app. It was fully funded as of February 5 and has since exceeded that, which allows it to now chase stretch goals of $150,000 and up, which would fund additional features for the app, like muting, filtering, search, bookmarking, and more.Image Credits: The IconfactoryThe Iconfactory isn't the only developer who has seized on this moment to develop a new multi-service social app.The developer behind the popular Mac and iOS newsreader app Reeder, Silvio Rizzi, is now working on something of a Reeder replacement. Though Rizzi says Reeder will continue to be supported, the new project aims to offer more than just news feeds. In an announcement on Mastodon last week, the developer teased plans for an app that's ""not just an RSS reader,"" but instead a tool that would allow you to access content from across sources, like ""podcasts, YouTube, Mastodon, and more,"" he said.The app is expected to launch into public beta later this spring on Mac, iPhone, and iPad. (A screenshot of the app concept Rizzi posted offered a nod to Tapestry, as both projects emerged around the same time.)Image Credits: Silvio RizziMeanwhile, Tapbots, the makers of Mastodon client Ivory (and previously the Twitter app Tweetbot on which it's based), is weighing how to approach the growing number of social networks available to users. There is no single Twitter alternative, so deciding where to focus limited developer resources is key.According to Tapbots co-founder Paul Haddad, the company hasn't yet decided whether it will support Bluesky yet, but says they are thinking about it.""We’ve got our next few months pretty booked with Ivory/Mastodon features and of course are committed to the Fediverse long-term,"" he told TechCrunch, referring to the decentralized social web powered by the ActivityPub protocol. ""We do plan to take a look at Bluesky sometime after that.""However, if Tapbots chooses to support Bluesky, it may or may not be part of the Ivory app, he added.Other services are focused on the needs of power users and creators to cross-post to multiple networks at once. This includes scheduling tools like those from fedica and Postpone, as well as consumer apps like Yup. The latter offers a solution for posting to X, Bluesky, Farcaster, Lens, and Threads, though it lacks access to a Threads developer API, requiring users to disable Instagram’s two-factor authentication (2FA) to get it to work. (We do NOT recommend this.)Image Credits: YupSimilarly, an app from a Japanese developer, Sora, offers access to Mastodon, Bluesky, and the federated networks Misskey and Firefish.Then there are the various web3, blockchain-based networks, and protocols, like Farcaster and Lens, as well as other decentralized protocols that are fostering networks of their own, like Nostr (favored by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey these days). There's also the decentralized network Matrix, which offers multiple cross-platform clients.Even Reddit has inspired decentralized alternatives, like Lemmy, /kbin, and other smaller projects.Because not all the decentralized networks talk to each other, bridges between protocols are also being built, like those that connect Matrix to Nostr or Mastodon to Bluesky, among others.Quipped Columbia Journalism Review journalist and longtime tech early adopter Mathew Ingram in a post on Threads, ""We need a FriendFeed for the 2000s.""His reference recalls a former era of social networking plenty, Web 2.0, when users turned to a social networking aggregator co-founded by then-former Googlers Bret Taylor (former Salesforce Co-CEO), Gmail creator Paul Buchheit, Jim Norris, and Sanjeev Singh. FriendFeed brought together social networking websites, bookmarking sites, websites, blogs, and microblogs into one place -- something that's again in demand today following the explosion of Twitter alternatives and decentralized services.Of course, Facebook eventually acquired FriendFeed and began to dominate social media, shutting out even well-resourced competitors like Google+. Now known as Meta, the social networking giant remains unbeaten, with nearly 3.2 billion users across its family of apps. But in its rush to adopt the ActivityPub protocol in its new app Threads, also used by Mastodon, there's a hint of concern. It suggests that even Meta believes the tide could possibly turn against it, as users embrace these alternative social platforms.For some smaller apps, the decision is whether to try to compete with the growing number of alternatives or join them. For instance, the Twitter competitor, Spoutible, founded by Christopher Bouzy, the developer of a Twitter analytics service previously, announced in December that his network would ""soon"" integrate with Mastodon for cross-posting and later, Threads.""Users being able to post across various platforms positions Spoutible not just as a social media platform but as a versatile tool designed to streamline your digital communication,"" he wrote, after it was clear Spoutible was not among those favored to win the competition to be the new Twitter.Unfortunately for people in hopes of a simple cross-posting solution, Spoutible this month faced security issues when it was revealed the API had a serious vulnerability that could allow hackers to take control of user accounts. The API even returned users' 2FA (two-factor authentication) code and the reset tokens that helped users change passwords. That puts Spoutible's cross-posting plans on the back burner for the time being, if not its future altogether.Another Web 2.0 survivor, Flipboard, also recently decided integration was the best path forward. It ditched Twitter and integrated with Mastodon while rebuilding its backend to join the fediverse -- the decentralized social web. The social magazine app also became the first app to support Bluesky, Mastodon, and Pixelfed (a decentralized Instagram alternative) last May, allowing users to track updates across these social networks, as well as YouTube, all in one place.Image Credits: FlipboardAnother platform, micro.blog, is looking to address the cross-posting needs from a different angle: as the blog host. Instead of creating content directly on social platforms, users could publish to micro.blog, follow other bloggers, and engage in conversations, while also still cross-posting to more popular platforms including Mastodon, Medium, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Flickr, Bluesky, Nostr, and Pixelfed. (The Iconfactory said its forthcoming app Tapestry would also support micro.blog).Elsewhere, publishing giant WordPress acquired an ActivityPub plugin to allow WordPress blogs to join the fediverse. Newsletter platform Substack created a short-form ""Notes"" feed that resembled Twitter. Artifact, the aggregator from Instagram's co-founders, eventually pivoted to cloning Twitter before shutting down.In short, a lot is going on in the social web today. And this is by no means a definitive list of those companies and developers attacking the problem -- or adding to it. Unnamed are, of course, the wide variety of open source and smaller projects in the works, too, as is common when open APIs are available.Whether this explosion of new social networks is a temporary problem or a new state of being remains to be seen. Likely, some of the smaller ""Twitter-alts"" will eventually die off, after failing to gain traction, or will fold into the wider fediverse, as the would-be Twitter rival Pebble (formerly T2) did last year.But it's also possible that we're witnessing the rebuilding of the web in real time. One where there are many protocols, many platforms, and many ways to connect not just people, but also their media, and their ideas, along with links to websites, news, and blogs.Aggregators like Tapestry may be an initial step to figuring out how to navigate this new web, but it also calls out for a way to search it too: a new Google of sorts that plugs into all the activity now taking place beyond websites, including the information that's shared through these novel social networks across new protocols. And who is building that?Twitterrific’s team is back with Tapestry, an app for tracking social media, news, RSS and moreAs Bluesky opens to the public, CEO Jay Graber faces her biggest challenge yetThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/07/how-twitters-descent-into-chaos-is-paving-the-way-for-a-new-web/Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:49:11.108478`META
Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Magnificent 7 ETFs Rise on Blockbuster Earnings`"The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Tesla TSLA, now account for almost 30% of the S&P 500 index. They were responsible for more than 62% of the S&P 500’s total return in 2023.Most experts anticipated a broadening of the market rally in 2024; however, market leadership has narrowed further this year. These stocks have driven more than 80% of the index's rise.All these companies benefited from the AI hype in 2023, but we've seen divergent performances in 2024 as investors assess which will emerge as the biggest beneficiaries of the forthcoming AI boom.Nvidia and Meta are leading the group, while Tesla significantly lags. This divergence has expanded in the past few weeks, as all but one reported their financial results. Meta's results were particularly well-received, sending the shares of the social media giant up more than 20%.Tesla has been punished for missing both earnings and revenue estimates. The EV giant’s earnings were down almost 46% amid weakening margins. The stock has lost 26% of its value this year.While NVIDIA is yet to announce its results, its stock has already appreciated by 42% in 2024, following a 240% increase in 2023, as most other giants disclosed aggressive AI investments.The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS provides equal weight exposure to these stocks.

Meta challenges supervisory fee for EU online content rules`"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Meta Platforms has challenged a supervisory fee amounting to 0.05% of its annual worldwide net income aimed at covering EU regulators' costs of monitoring compliance with new European Union rules requiring it to do more to police content.The European Commission has said the Digital Services Act (DSA) levy applies to 20 very large online platforms, including Meta, Google, Apple and TikTok and two very large online search engines.The size of the annual fee is related to the number of average monthly active users for each company and whether it posts a profit or loss in the preceding financial year.Meta said it disagreed with the methodology used to calculate the fees.""Currently, companies that record a loss don't have to pay, even if they have a large user base or represent a greater regulatory burden, which means some companies pay nothing, leaving others to pay a disproportionate amount of the total,"" a Meta spokesperson said.The company has challenged the levy at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest. Politico was the first to report about Meta's move.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by David Gregorio)Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:49:11.108478`META
Meta accused of not taking Facebook Marketplace fraud seriously`Meta has been accused by MPs of not taking the problem of online fraud on its platforms seriously.The parent company of Facebook and Instagram came under scrutiny from the Home Affairs Select Committee after representatives from the banking sector said the “majority” of scams they see start on Meta platforms.Paul Davis, financial crime prevention director at TSB, told the committee that Facebook Marketplace is the “main place” where purchase scams originate, which, along with investment and impersonation scams, are the most common types of fraud affecting bank customers.“For those three types, which as I say are the main ones, we see about 80% start on social media,” Mr Davis told MPs.“Indeed, let’s not walk past the fact that, when I say social media there, the majority of them start from the channels owned by one company in particular, which is Meta.”🗣️We are now live and questioning banks and big tech firms on how they protect people from fraud. We are hearing from:@TSB@RevolutApp@santanderuk@Meta@BTGroup@Microsoft📺Watch here: https://t.co/tzoMPErfmQ pic.twitter.com/W9vtl7DRJe— Home Affairs Committee (@CommonsHomeAffs) February 7, 2024He added: “Facebook Marketplace doesn’t have a payments channel attached to it, it’s not like a website you might use to buy something off a high street shop, for example, or Amazon. So, you have to get bank details from the seller of that item.“What we see are customers telling us that they get bank details from the seller, send them money and then the item never turns up.”In response, Philip Milton, public policy manager for fraud at Meta, told the committee that the tech giant takes the issue “extremely seriously”.When suggested by the committee that evidence given to MPs by the banks shows Meta is not doing all it can to prevent online fraud, Mr Milton said: “I disagree with that.”He went on: “To give you an idea of the scale that we’re putting in place to tackle this kind of thing, since 2016 we’ve invested 20 billion dollars on safety and security, and that’s not slowing down – five billion of that was in the last year alone.“We have 40,000 people working across the company on safety and security. Half of that number are involved in directly reviewing content, so we invest significantly in trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening.”He added that fraud “fundamentally undermines the experience we’re trying to provide for people” and said this, combined with fraudulent advertising affecting trust in the company from advertisers and its wider reputation, means the firm is “directly incentivised” to do all it can to prevent criminal activity.However, committee member Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, argued that the five billion dollars Meta said it spent last year on safety and security equates to less than 4% of the firm’s annual revenue for the year – a figure he suggested is “not very high”.Mr Loughton also questioned whether the 20,000 people reviewing content for Meta is an adequate number given the site has “four billion active accounts”, and suggested the social media giant is not taking the issue “terribly seriously” because, as Facebook Marketplace does not have a payments channel linked to it, the site is not financially liable if fraud takes place there.“You apparently have no financial skin in the game for clamping down on fraud on Facebook Marketplace other than potential reputational damage,” he said.“Unless there’s a clear link with advertisers walking away with their revenue because they’re concerned at (banking sector research showing) 80% of fraud starting on (social media platforms) and 68% of it specifically your platforms, then you don’t really have to take it terribly seriously – and the fact you’re spending five billion dollars out of an annual revenue of 134.9 billion, which, as I say, is three and a bit percent for a people-based service, is tiny.“So you’re not taking this problem seriously, are you?”In response, Mr Milton said: “I don’t agree with that at all”, and argued that “the scale of our investment demonstrates how seriously we take this problem”, adding that it is “market-leading” levels of funding for safety and security.He added that, in response to tactics from fraudsters who demand payment or ask for an item to be sent before it is paid for, Meta has “removed the ability to ship an item on Facebook Marketplace”, and that there is “no way to pay for an item” on the platform because the firm is trying to “design out” the ability for criminals to use the platform for fraud.Related Quotes`2024-02-08 00:49:11.108478`META
Germany forced to slash DHL stake by €2.2bn to fix railways`Germany has been forced to sell off some of its stake in package deliverer DHL as it struggles to improve the country’s rail network amid a budget crisis.The KfW bank, which holds the government’s remaining stakes in previously state-held companies, said it has sold 50 million shares of Deutsche Post, the name under which it still trades on the stock exchange.The €2.2bn (£1.9bn) sale, at €43.45 each, cuts the German state’s share in the company by 4pc to 16.5pc.Germany’s finance ministry said the money would be used to strengthen the capital of Germany’s main railway operator, the state-owned Deutsche Bahn, and to improve railway infrastructure.The government has been forced to turn to share sales to help finance improvements to the rail network after a court ruling forced it to plug a big hole in this year’s budget and reconsider its wider financial plans.In November, Germany’s highest court annulled a decision made by the government in 2022 to repurpose €60bn originally meant to cushion the fallout from the pandemic for measures to help combat climate change and modernise the country.Read the latest updates below.Thanks for joining us today. My colleague Chris Price will be back in the morning, reporting on the latest company news as the London markets open.Brussels has waved through new rules that will force derivative traders to clear deals through the European Union, dealing the latest blow to the City. Our reporter Adam Mawardi has the details:London could lose control of its lucrative clearing market after EU officials backed proposals to shift more business activity to operators across the bloc.The provisional rules require banks and asset managers above a certain threshold to clear derivative contracts, such as euro interest rate swaps, through accounts with EU-based clearing houses.Vincent Van Peteghem, Belgium’s finance minister who helped negotiate the agreement with the European Parliament, said: “This will bring more clearing services to Europe and enhance our strategic autonomy.”Clearing houses serve as middlemen between buyers and sellers for financial assets and ensure deals go through even when counterparties default.They have become a crucial part of the banking system following the 2008 financial crisis which exposed the risks around derivative trading.The controversial change is designed to make EU clearing houses more attractive, effectively ending Europe’s reliance on UK-based rivals following Brexit.Read the full report...The sovereign wealth fund behind McLaren is seeking to bring in new investors to help fund the British carmaker’s growth, according to a report.McLaren’s controlling shareholder, Mumtalakat of Bahrain, is looking to raise additional investment to develop McLaren’s technology and enter new markets.

We’re just not sure yet whether it will affect our deliveries between now and the end of June.Boeing told The Telegraph:Ryanair is a valued customer and we are working closely with them to address their concerns. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to improve our quality and delivery performance and will support our customers every step of the way.Rishi Sunak must slash Britain’s benefits bill instead of relying on immigration if he wants to get the country’s debts under control, according to an official at the UK’s budget watchdog. Szu Ping Chan reports:Rishi Sunak must slash Britain’s benefits bill instead of relying on immigration if he wants to get the country’s debts under control, according to an official at the UK’s budget watchdog.David Miles, an executive member of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said waves of new migrants would not solve Britain’s fiscal crisis and were likely to add to pressure on public services.The former Bank of England rate-setter added that a migrant-driven upgrade to the UK’s population projections may not provide a long-term boost to the public finances. It came as analysis by Bloomberg suggested that rising migrant numbers could hand Jeremy Hunt £18bn for tax cuts next month by boosting the economy.Writing for the Telegraph, Mr Miles described welfare reforms that encouraged more people back to work as “unambiguously beneficial” for tax revenues, adding that a drive to get increase employment was “particularly great” for younger people suffering from mental health issues.By contrast, the Imperial College professor said it was “much less clear that persistently high levels of net immigration to boost the labour force can generate sustained fiscal improvements”, suggesting that relying on public investment or a sharp rise in productivity were also unlikely to bear fruit.Read the full report...Luxury online store Farfetch has been dealt a fresh blow as the owner of Bergdorf Goodman moved to end a partnership deal struck two years ago.The Telegraph understands that Neiman Marcus Group is pulling a tie-up with the British fashion retailer, which last month collapsed and was rescued by South Korea’s Coupang.Under the deal which was agreed in early 2022, Farfetch and Neiman Marcus had been working on improving the Bergdorf Goodman website and mobile app. Bergdorf Goodman is a well-known luxury US department store which has featured in shows including Gossip Girl.Farfetch also agreed to take a minority stake in Neiman Marcus under the 2022 agreement, investing $200m (£158m) into the business. It is understood to still hold this position.The end of the partnership comes in the wake of Coupang’s swoop on Farfetch, which saw the South Korean company buy the British fashion firm in a rescue deal after its value collapsed 99pc.The deal wiped out shareholders and many of the company’s bondholders.Bondholders have since demanded an investigation into the conduct of José Neves, the co-founder and chief executive of Farfetch.A spokesman for Neiman Marcus said the group had “decided to end its commercial partnership with Farfetch”.They added: “The Bergdorf Goodman website and app will continue to serve as the luxury ecommerce destination for its customers and will no longer be re-platforming onto Farfetch Platform Solutions... We appreciate Farfetch, which continues to be a minority investor in NMG.”A spokesperson for Farfetch said: “We continue to partner closely with thousands of brands and boutiques around the world to provide an elevated online luxury experience for millions of customers.”The FTSE 100 closed down 0.68pc.

No longer: their products are now typically on a par with German quality but at significantly lower prices. I remember being in Chongqing [in southwestern China] where the Germans built the first line on the metro system - trains, track escalators etc etc. There are now over 10 lines all built with no German input - but to the same standard. This isn’t new. It is exactly what the Japanese and South Koreans did.So Germany is losing its export markets.Mike Doe says:It remains an unfathomable mystery why Europe, and in particular Germany, has chosen to sacrifice its automotive industry and its associated jobs on the altar of net zero to benefit the Chinese Communist Party.Robert Young writes:So Germany forced into fire sale of state assets to fund its crumbling railway and road infrastructure! The glory days of the German economy are now well and truly over as it collapses into deep recession and gloom.Rob Houghton comments on the high price of German exports:German products, and especially cars, are now hugely expensive to buy. I suspect the Chinese are going to fill the gap.Joshua Tamworth says:Isn’t it strange that the elite always forecast the German economy more positively than actuals, and the UK more negatively than actuals.For something like 20 quarters in a row.You’d conclude that there’s conscious and unconscious bias towards the EU, and its positive impact on the economy.Italy’s government will offer targeted tax breaks to help farmers facing hardship, a minister told the Italian parliament on Wednesday, amid a wave of protests across continental Europe.Farmers have staged demonstrations to express their anger about low prices for produce, rising costs, cheap imports and burdens imposed by the EU’s climate change policies.The protests have eased in France and Germany for now but appear to be growing in intensity in countries such as Spain and Italy, where groups of farmers have congregated outside Rome with their tractors.The Italian government appears set to partially restore an income tax break which had been dropped in the budget law for 2024, accepting one of the farmers’ key requests.“A measure aimed at providing tax exemption for those agricultural entrepreneurs who need effective support ... is being studied,” Italian minister Luca Ciriani said.“It is clear that the main priority for this government in managing public resources is to use them to support the weakest,” added Mr Ciriani, a member of Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party.He said the tax breaks could be included in a government decree currently being examined in parliament.The US carmaker is moving away from expensive models to lure mainstream drivers, writes Melissa Lawford:Ford is to launch a range of cheap electric vehicles as it seeks to compete with Chinese manufacturers and Tesla.The US carmaker’s chief executive Jim Farley on Tuesday announced plans to move away from big, expensive electric vehicles (EVs) to lower cost models that will convince mainstream car buyers to go electric, after years of secret development in a so-called skunkworks hived off from the main business.High prices are the biggest factor holding back everyday consumers from purchasing EVs over petrol vehicles, Mr Farley said.Speaking to analysts on a conference call, he said Ford had “made a bet in silence two years ago” to start developing cheap EVs.Mr Farley said: “We’re also adjusting our capital, switching more focus onto smaller EV products.Read on to find out what Ford management is “ruthlessly focused” on...Britain’s top technology firm, Arm Holdings, is issuing its quarterly results this evening - the second since it floated in New York.The chip designer makes money by licensing designs that others manufacture, and its technology is used in electronics from companies including Apple and Samsung.The company is expected to do well from demand for artificial intelligence services, with companies such as Microsoft attracted to the energy efficiency offered by Arm processors.Sara Russo, an analyst at brokers Sanford C. Bernstein, said:We expect positive long-term value commentary around Arm-based servers and laptops, but continue to believe we will have to wait for full-year 2025 for any significant recovery in royalty rates.Arm shares are up 2.1pc in trading today.The US trade deficit narrowed in 2023 to the smallest in three years, American government data showed Wednesday, while the country imported more goods from Mexico than China for the first time in about two decades.The latest figures add to a series of positive economic news for President Joe Biden, who has been working to boost sentiment on his handling of the economy as his November reelection campaign picks up pace.For all of 2023, the overall trade gap was $773.4bn, down 18.7 percent from the $951.2bn figure in the prior year, US Commerce Department figures showed.In 2022, the country saw the biggest deficit in government data dating back to 1960.But the latest numbers showed a fall in the goods deficit last year, with imports of products dropping more than exports.Purchases of supplies like crude oil and fuel oil fell, while Americans bought less consumer goods like clothing and cell phones as well.This was partly due to the unravelling of consumption patterns during the Covid-19 pandemic, during which people cooped up at home spent on items including electronics as they worked remotely.Meanwhile, exports of services increased last year, particularly in the travel sector, and the services surplus widened.Surprisingly resilient consumption last year has helped to support the US economy, but analysts expect higher interest rates to slow consumer spending and add pressure on imports.Shares in Snap, the company behind the social media app Snapchat, have plunged 34pc today after it released disappointing results and gave an uninspiring forecast for 2024.The stock market reaction wiped $958m off chief executive Evan Spiegel’s stake in the firm.In the final quarter of 2023, revenue rose 5pc to $1.36bn in the fourth quarter of 2023, missing the $1.38bn average of analysts’ estimates and disappointing investors after strong results for the quarter from Facebook owner Meta.The company continued to lose money, posting a loss of $1.3bn, although this was at a slightly lower level than in 2023.The company is continuing to forecast losses this year, with revenue growing by 11pc to 15pc.The company pre-empted the results by announcing on Monday that it would lay off about 10pc of its workforce, amounting to about 500 employees.Mr Spiegel said: “2023 was a pivotal year for Snap, as we transformed our advertising business and continued to expand our global community, reaching 414 million daily active users.“Snapchat enhances relationships with friends, family, and the world, and this unique value proposition has provided a strong foundation to build our business for long-term growth.”That’s all from me today. My colleague Alex Singleton will keep you furnished with the latest essential updates.The boss of Sainsbury’s has refused to rule out job losses under plans to slash costs by £1bn as the chain revealed it will cut general merchandise and clothing space and expand its food offering.The UK’s second biggest supermarket unveiled a strategy update that will see it boost food space across all its near-600 supermarkets, while focusing expansion efforts on 180 of its “highest potential” sites, which will see about 10pc more space dedicated to food.But it will also cut its general merchandise and clothing offering across many shops, with between 20pc to 30pc less store space for non-food ranges in the 180 shops.The retailer suggested jobs may be in the firing line, as it said it would cut costs by £1bn over the next three years, while investing in technology and artificial intelligence (AI).Chief executive Simon Roberts refused to rule out job losses as the group plans to use AI to increase automation.He said the group would look to “protect jobs as much as possible” by being flexible and to “re-skill” and “re-deploy where we can”.Our retail editor Hannah Boland has the details.Germany has been forced to sell off some of its stake in package deliverer DHL as it struggles to improve the country’s rail network amid a budget crisis.The KfW bank, which holds the government’s remaining stakes in previously state-held companies, said it has sold 50 million shares of Deutsche Post, the name under which it still trades on the stock exchange.The €2.2bn (£1.9bn) sale, at €43.45 each, cuts the German state’s share in the company by 4pc to 16.5pc.Germany’s finance ministry said the money would be used to strengthen the capital of Germany’s main railway operator, the state-owned Deutsche Bahn, and to improve railway infrastructure.The government has been forced to turn to share sales to help finance improvements to the rail network after a court ruling forced it to plug a big hole in this year’s budget and reconsider its wider financial plans.In November, Germany’s highest court annulled a decision made by the government in 2022 to repurpose €60bn originally meant to cushion the fallout from the pandemic for measures to help combat climate change and modernise the country.Sir Sajid Javid is among the potential candidates to become the

closer to wrenching control over euro clearing back from London today after reaching a key political agreement on new clearing rules.Our reporter Michael Bow has the latest:Officials from the EU Council and the EU Parliament backed a package of measures from the European Commission forcing banks clearing euro-derivatives trading to send a minimum portion of trades through EU-based institutions.The plan is designed to reduce reliance on London as a clearing centre post-Brexit.Despite broad support in Brussels, the proposals lack specific demands on the amount of clearing needed to be provided inside the EU.More than 90pc of euro-denominated clearing is done at London’s LCH, prompting fears in Brussels about a lack of oversight from the EU.UK and EU officials are still debating rules over equivalence, which allow the UK to clear euro-denominated contracts.Carlsberg has plunged to a £4.7bn loss after the Kremlin commandeered its Russian business.Our senior business reporter Daniel Woolfson has the details:Carlsberg’s Russian business unit, Baltika Breweries, was seized by Russian authorities last year after the Danish brewer tried to sell it and exit the country.The brewer said on Tuesday that the incident resulted in the company making a loss of 40.8bn Danish krone (£4.7bn) for the year.Carlsberg employed around 8,400 people in Russia prior to the seizure, and had been looking to sell the business amid pressure on consumer brands to leave Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.Read how the seizure of Carlsberg’s Russian business comes amid a

lower-than-expected sales revenue for the last quarter of 2023.Alibaba posted a 5pc increase in sales to 260.3bn yuan (£29bn) for the three months to December, slightly missing analyst estimates.Net income sank to 14.4bn yuan (£1.6bn), down 77pc compared to the same time last year.The Hangzhou-based business attributed the drastic drop in net income to the decrease in value of its equity investments and a decrease in income from operations due to that.Alibaba’s New York-listed stock price fell about 4pc in premarket trading following the report.Alibaba chief executive Eddie Wu said: “Our top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing.”Electric cars cannot be advertised as completely “zero emission” because of the carbon dioxide that is generated when they are made and charged, the advertising watchdog has declared.Our industry editor Matt Oliver has the details:In a ruling that will change how electric vehicles (EVs) are promoted, the Advertising Standards Authority has banned carmakers from referring to them as zero emission unless they make clear this is only while driving.The decision emerged as the regulator criticised BMW for describing its range of EVs as “zero emission cars” in Google searches.In the ruling, the ASA said: “We understood that when electric vehicles were driven no emissions were produced, unlike a car with a petrol or diesel engine where emissions came from the tailpipe.“However, in other circumstances, such as the manufacture or charging of an electric vehicle using electricity from the national grid, emissions were generated.”The ruling comes as demand for electric cars has waned.When was the last time you had a Breakaway bar? For many of you, the answer is “I have no idea” or “a very long time ago” and that is the way it is likely to stay forever.The Breakaway and Yorkie biscuit bars are to disappear from shelves following a decline in sales, maker Nestle has announced.The Yorkie Biscuit is not to be confused with Yorkie chocolate bars, which Nestle said are “staying for good”.Nestle said the chocolate-covered Breakaway will no longer be produced from March, to make way for new products.Breakaway fans can still buy the bar throughout February and March at Sainsbury’s while stocks last.The Breakaway, made with wholemeal, oat and coconut flours, was launched in 1970 by Rowntree Mackintosh before being acquired by Nestle in 1988.It follows Nestle blaming falling sales on its decision in November to discontinue the Caramac bar after 64 years.US stock indexes were subdued in premarket trading as investors grapple with uncertainty about the outlook for interest rate cuts.Ford jumped 6pc in premarket trading after the car maker increased its first-quarter dividend and decided to scale back investments in new capacity for loss-making electric vehicles.

Peer Pinterest shed 3.8pc.Uber announced its first full-year operating profit and forecast quarterly core profit and gross bookings above estimates. However, its shares were last down 1.7pc ahead of the opening bell.Wall Street has been relatively quiet this week following a stellar performance in the months before which saw the benchmark S&P 500 hit record highs.In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc, the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq 100 was up 0.1pc.Uber secured its first full-year operating profit as its number of bookings jumped in the run-up to Christmas in what its boss said was a “standout quarter to cap off a standout year”.Operating income swung from a loss of $1.8bn (£1.4bn) to a profit of $1.1bn (£870m).Gross bookings - which includes deliver orders, ride hailing and driver earnings - grew 22pc to $37.6bn (£29.8bn) in the final three months of 2023.The number of trips and monthly active platform consumers grew 24pc and 15pc, respectively, compared to the same period the previous year.Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said:2023 was an inflection point for Uber, proving that we can continue to generate strong, profitable growth at scale.Our audiences are larger and more engaged than ever, with our platform powering an average of nearly 26 million daily trips last year.The German economy is already threatened by recession after output shrank 0.3pc in the final three months of last year.Our economics editor Szu Ping Chan analyses the backdrop for Europe’s largest economy:Analysts believe the German economy could shrink again in the current quarter as ailing manufacturers struggle to adapt to a world without cheap Russian energy after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.Stefan Schilbe, HSBC’s chief German economist, said there was “little hope for a change in trend” in the coming months.He added: “Nationwide strikes by rail and airport workers are likely to weigh on output in January and February. In addition, the global economic climate remains subdued, coupled with high geopolitical risks amid the situation in the Red Sea, high interest rates, and domestic energy prices still well above their pre-pandemic level. So German manufacturers face more of the same weakness at the beginning of this year.”The country is also struggling to deal with a property crisis driven by plunging prices and a collapse in building activity.Analysts highlighted that car production was bouncing back, though Carsten Brzeski at ING said an ongoing decline in energy-intensive production “could lengthen the process of bottoming out”.Mr Brzeski said: “Germany wouldn’t be Germany these days if there weren’t new problems weighing on the short-term outlook: strikes and supply chain disruptions as a result of the military conflict in the Red Sea have made another contraction in the German economy in the first quarter of the year even more likely.”Oil prices have edged higher after a two-day gain amid the geopolitical risk in the Middle East - and some analysts think prices could be about to shift higher.Brent crude was last up 0.6pc to tip above $79 a barrel after climbing 1.6pc over the previous two sessions, while West Texas Intermediate was up 0.6pc to just under $74.Houthi rebels said they targeted two ships in the southern Red Sea, the latest in a string of attacks that has forced a major re-routing of global trade. The US has vowed more strikes against Iranian forces and their proxies in the region.However, the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute has kept a lid on price rises for now after it said US nationwide crude inventories rose 674,000 barrels last week.Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at Swedish bank SEB, said signs of a revival in the global economy will eventually push prices higher as Saudi Arabia decides against increasing production. He said:With emerging signs of a global revival, it is very unlikely that Saudi/OPEC+ will cave in and switch from “price over volume” to “volume over price”.A potential revival implies a stronger demand impulse down the road.And if you look upon the world economy with the eyes of an optimist your take would probably be: Chinese policy has shifted focus to growth, Biden’ infrastructure stimulus package is stimulating the economy significantly, the EU is crawling out of the woods as natural gas prices have come down, India marches on, inflation globally is fading and interest rate cuts are coming.Philip Milton, public policy manager for fraud at Meta, told the Home Affairs Select Committee that the tech giant took the issue of fraud on the platform “extremely seriously”.Responding to evidence from the banking sector about large-scale fraud occurring on Facebook Marketplace, Mr Milton said fraud “fundamentally undermines the experience we’re trying to provide for people” and said this, combined with fraudulent advertising impacting trust in the company from advertisers, meant the tech giant was “directly incentivised” to do all it can to prevent criminal activity.When suggested by the committee that the evidence to MPs from the banks showed Meta was not doing all it could to prevent online fraud, Mr Milton said:I disagree with that. To give you an idea of the scale that we’re putting in place to tackle this kind of thing, since 2016 we’ve invested 20 billion dollars on safety and security, and that’s not slowing down - five billion of that was in the last year alone.We have 40,000 people working across the company on safety and security. Half of that number are involved in directly reviewing content, so we invest significantly in trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening.A quick look at the energy markets, where wholesale gas prices remain subdued as mild winter weather reduces demand for heating.Europe’s benchmark contract fell as much as 2.6pc today and was last down 0.2pc to less than €29 per megawatt hour.Prices have fallen more than 30pc since October as temperatures remained above usual levels, keeping already extra-full storage sites well stocked.The UK equivalent contract was down 0.7pc, having fallen as much as 3.2pc in early trading.The pound has risen against the dollar as the latest figures showed house prices in Britain rose at their fastest annual pace in a year - supporting bets that the Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates soon.Sterling was up 0.3pc to $1.26 as property values jumped for the fourth month in a row, according to Halifax.The pound was also up 0.2pc against the euro, which is worth 85p, as Bank of England policymaker Sarah Breeden said the next few months were “incredibly important” in assessing the impact of wages on inflation.Tumbling inflation and slowing pay growth could open the way to lower interest rates in the coming months, the Bank of England’s newest monetary policymaker has hinted.Our deputy economics editor Tim Wallace has the latest:Sarah Breeden, who joined the Monetary Policy Committee in November, said last year’s worries over the persistence of inflation have started to fade.In December “the question I was focused on was whether there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures which might mean we needed to tighten further,” she said.“As I have become more confident that persistence is likely to evolve as embodied within our forecast, I have become less concerned that rates might need to be tightened further. Instead my focus, and indeed the focus of many on the MPC, has shifted to thinking about how long rates need to remain at their current level.”Inflation stood at 4pc in December, lower than the Bank of England predicted but still twice its 2pc target.Ms Breeden said she will look for more evidence on wages and inflation before moving interest rates from their current level of 5.25pc.“The next few months will be incredibly important for my assessment of wage and price persistence, with the majority of this year’s wage setting processes set to conclude by April,” she said.Eight in 10 of the most commons financial frauds faced by consumers begin on social media, MPs have been told.Paul Davis, financial crime prevention director at TSB, told the Home Affairs Committee:The three main types of fraud that impact our customers are purchase scams, they’re the most common, although they tend to be lower value; investment scams, which are a bit less common but tend to be very high value; and impersonation scams.For those three types, which as I say are the main ones, we see about 80pc start on social media.Indeed, let’s not walk past the fact that when I say social media there, the majority of them start from the channels owned by one company in particular, which is Meta.He added: “For purchase scams, we find Facebook Marketplace is the main place where those scams originate.”Shares in Imperial Leather maker PZ Cussons have plunged after the consumer goods giant revealed it had swung to a loss, as it continues to be rocked by volatility in the Nigerian economy.The Manchester-based maker of household brands including Imperial Leather, Carex and St.Tropez said “we have clearly had our challenges” as it unveiled its half-year results.The company showed it swung to a statutory pre-tax loss of £94.2m in the six months to December, down from a profit of £40.5m the previous year.Revenues fell by nearly 18pc over the same period, from £336.9m to £277.1m.The business has a major market in Nigeria, which represents more than a third of its total sales, and has regularly stressed a prolonged slump in the value of the naira, the country’s currency, has wiped money from its sales.It said the currency is about 70pc weaker than a year ago, which represents the biggest drop in value in its history. Inflation in the region is also at a 30-year high of nearly 30pc.PZ Cussons said this led to foreign exchange losses of about £88m, dragging on its profits and sales.Shares in PZ Cussons were down as much as 20.1pc to take it to the bottom of the FTSE 250.Siemens Energy swung to a €1.6bn (£1.3bn) net profit thanks to a one-off gain from the sale of a subsidiary to its parent company.Our energy editor Jonathan Leake has the latest:The troubled German-based company, which makes wind turbines used in many UK wind farms, is recovering from a financial crisis caused partly by quality issues in some of its onshore models and partly by industry-wide inflation and supply problems.Last year those crises forced it to seek financial guarantee from the German government for some of its projects.Siemens Energy has become a vital part of the UK wind industry. It owns a turbine blade factory in Hull that employs 1,200 people and which supplies many of the windfarms being built around the UK. Overall the company employs 6,000 people in the UK.President and chief executive Christian Bruch said the company was getting back on course.He said: “The solid first quarter is encouraging... our focus remains on solving the quality problems in our onshore wind business and making the most of the growth potential for the rest of the company.”Pandora, the world’s biggest jewellery maker, said its performance since the start of the year has been “healthy” with high single-digit sales growth, as it announced a share buyback programme after a strong run.Pandora, which sells charm bracelets, has been a rare bright spot among retailers and brands targeting aspirational consumers with affordable luxury items.The company aims for organic revenue growth of 6pc-9pc in 2024, after reporting strong sales of its silver charms and bracelets which have helped its share price to more than double since the start of last year.Soren Lontoft Hansen, senior analyst at Sydbank, said: “Despite the worldwide macroeconomic uncertainties… the company is manoeuvring strongly and better than the market.”The growth target is in line with a goal set in October for a 7-9pc compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2026.Pandora also announced a share buyback programme of up to 4 billion Danish krona (£457.1m), and a dividend of 18 Danish crowns per share. Its shares rose 0.5pc at the open.UK shares have edged downwards in early trading amid a a sell-off in precious mining stocks and uncertainty over interest rate cuts.The blue-chip FTSE 100 was down 0.2pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 index was flat.It was a good start for housebuilders after house prices rose at their the strongest annual rate in a year last month, adding to tentative signs of momentum in the property market.Developers across the FTSE 100 and 250 gained as much as 1.7pc before settling at gains of 0.1pc as a merger between Barratt and Redrow was also announced.Barratt Developments shares dropped as much as 8.9pc to the bottom of the FTSE 100 while Redrow shares climbed as much as 16.7pc to the peak of the FTSE 250.However, markets were dragged down by precious metal miners, which shed as much as 1.2pc on lower gold prices, ahead of speeches by Federal Reserve officials through the week.Soap maker PZ Cussons forecast a lower annual profit and slashed its interim dividend, sending its shares as much as 16.6pc lower to the bottom of FTSE 250.Analysts have been bashing away at their keyboards to make sense of Barratt’s takeover of rival housebuilder Redrow.Quilter Cheviot property fund research analyst Oli Creasey said:By some measures, Barratt is already the largest public housebuilder in the UK. It isn’t the most valuable company by market cap, but the volume of houses built in the past year is ahead of any of its peers.So we wouldn’t categorise this transaction as a need to build scale. However, there is likely to be a some element of cost synergies to be harvested as a result of combining two companies in the same industry, and a limited amount of geographical overlap.Looking at share prices, the deal is an attractive one for Redrow shareholders, who get a boost to the undisturbed share price, and become holders in a much larger business.It is less clear what the advantage is for Barratt, although given the structure of the deal, there’s limited downside – the all-share deal means that no cash needs to change hands, and the balance sheet strength is unchanged.It should also be noted that at a price equal to 1.2x Redrow’s NAV, it isn’t a particularly expensive price being paid, and will create the undisputed largest public housebuilder in the UK.German industrial production fell for a seventh straight month, official data showed, marking its longest series of declines since the period after reunification in the early 1990s.Output plunged by 1.6pc in December compared to the previous month, federal statistics agency Destatis said, following a revised 0.2pc fall in November.The drop was far worse than the 0.35pc decline predicted by analysts at FactSet and caps the longest run of falls since 1993.Melanie Debono at Pantheon Macroeconomics described the figures as “ugly”, adding: “The recession in industry will continue this quarter.”The sharper-than-expected decline was driven by steep falls in the chemical industry and the construction sector. The car industry meanwhile saw a 4pc rise in production.For the whole of 2023, industrial output was 1.5pc lower than a year earlier, Destatis said, and still below pre-pandemic levels.Germany’s crucial industrial sector, which used to be heavily reliant on cheap Russian gas imports, has been reeling ever since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine pushed energy costs higher.Higher interest rates and weaker export demand have added to the economic headwinds, as its economy shrank by 0.3pc last year.Capital Economics economist Franziska Palmas said that industry “remains a significant drag on growth”.She added: “We expect this to continue throughout 2024.”Die reale #Produktion im Produzierenden Gewerbe ist Dezember 2023 gegenüber November 2023 voraussichtlich um 1,6 % gesunken. Im Gesamtjahr 2023 lag sie um 1,5 % unter dem Vorjahr.

It also cancelled Ocean 2, also off the New Jersey coast, where construction was planned to start in 2028.The company recorded losses of 20.2bn Danish Kroner - about £2.2bn. This was despite operating profits of 19bn Danish kroner - about £2.2bn.TotalEnergies has reported the highest profit in its history - but still missed analyst expectations despite outperforming peers like Shell and BP.The French company said profit came in at $21.4bn (£17bn) in 2023, an increase of 4pc on the previous year but below predictions of $23.7bn.Its bottom line put the French energy conglomerate ahead of Shell, BP, Exxon-Mobil and Chevron, which all reported lower earnings in the face of weaker energy prices.However, TotalEnergies’s 2022 net profit had been weighed down by a huge exceptional charge - $15bn - from its withdrawal from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.Once non-recurring items were stripped out, profits suffered a sharp downturn last year, with adjusted net profit falling 36pc to $23.2bn.Oil and gas prices dropped some 10pc on average last year from 2022 when spiking oil prices had boosted earnings at energy companies worldwide.Chairman Patrick Pouyanne called the results “robust”, saying in a statement they had been achieved in “an uncertain environment”. Hydrocarbons had performed well, he said.It has been a mixed story for the shares of Barratt and Redrow after the announcement of their merger.Barratt shares have slipped 3.7pc - perhaps as shareholders bulk at the idea of holding 67.2pc of a combined company.Meanwhile, Redrow shares have surged by as much as 17pc after recommending the takeover, which values the business at £2.5bn.Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:The economic winds have not been kind to the housebuilders and Barratt Developments and Redrow clearly believe they’ll be stronger together, giving the new combined company much bigger clout to capitalise on the structural need for housing in the UK.Redrow’s share price has struggled to regain its pre-pandemic form and with Barratt enjoying a strong balance sheet and hefty cash reserves it clearly decided the time was right to make a move.Clearly market conditions are still going to be tougher while interest rates stay elevated.However, the latest signs are that recovery is underway, with the Halifax house price index pointing to renewed sentiment among buyers, as better mortgage deals have landed.The FTSE 100 opened higher following large gains on Wall Street and after Chinese regulators issued another set of market-enhancing policies.The UK’s blue chip index began the day up 0.1pc to 7,688.72 while the midcap FTSE 250 rose 0.2pc to 19,208.63.Sainsbury’s has unveiled plans to overhaul its supermarkets with a focus on creating more food space and revealed aims to slash costs by £1bn over the next three years.The UK’s second biggest supermarket chain said it would cut its general merchandise offering and clothing offering across many sites to create more space for food and ensure it is offering full grocery ranges in more stores.In its strategy update, the group said it will also “tighten the focus” of its non-food ranges, while adding there would be more changes for its Argos store estate, having already shut a raft of sites to bring many within supermarkets since it bought the retailer.The new plan - called Next Level Sainsbury’s - will see it cut costs by £1bn over the next three years, focusing on technology investments to deliver automation and savings.The increase in house prices for a fourth month in a row puts Britain about halfway towards a 3pc increase in house prices this year already, according to economists.Andrew Wishart, senior property economist at Capital Economics, said:The Halifax index has a track record of being quick to respond to changes in mortgage rates, so the large increases of 1.1pc in December and 1.3pc in January reflect the swift drop in the average quoted mortgage rate from 5pc in November to about 4.5pc in January.Fixed mortgage rates are unlikely to fall any further in the near term, which will restrain future monthly gains in the Halifax index.As the increase mirrored a large rise in the Nationwide index for the same month, there is little doubt that house prices made a strong start to the year.He added: “While we doubt that will continue (prices would rise by over 10pc this year if it did), our non-consensus call that house prices will rise this year looks like the right one.”The tie-up between Barratt and Redrow is expected to eventually lead to savings of at least £90m a year, the companies said.It comes as British housebuilders recover from the worst downturn since the financial crisis as high property prices and mortgage rates triggered a slump in sales last year.Last summer house price falls in July were more widespread than at any point since 2009, according to Rics’ UK residential market survey of estate agents.Redrow chief executive Matthew Pratt said:Redrow and Barratt combined creates a leading UK homebuilder.Together, we’ll be in a much better position to offer a broader range of high-quality and energy efficient homes to customers.He added: “The Redrow brand, with its premium, characterful homes, has an excellent reputation and will remain a key part of the Combined Group. As with Barratt, Redrow’s fifty-year success story is based on its people, products and supply chain partners. Both businesses are a great fit and there are many exciting opportunities to innovate and share knowledge across a range of different areas.”House builder Barratt will merge with its rival developer Redrow as the sector consolidates after the downturn caused by high interest rates.Barratt said it will buy the entire issued and to be issued share capital of its rival as part of the deal, creating a combined group which will be renamed as Barratt Redrow.The merger deal will offer Redrow shareholders 1.44 of new Barratt shares at a premium of 27.2pc, valuing the developer at £2.5bn.Once the takeover is complete, Redrow shareholders will hold approximately 32.8pc of the combined group and Barratt shareholders will hold approximately 67.2pc.Barratt chief executive David Thomas said the combined businesses “would leverage the respective strengths of both Barratt and Redrow, delivering significant benefits to our people, our supply chains, and - most importantly - our customers”.Redrow founder Steve Morgan added that Barratt is a home builder he has “long admired,” while chief executive Matthew Pratt said the combined companies “creates a leading UK homebuilder”House prices rose last month as falling mortgage rates increased the number of potential buyers, according to an industry survey.Property values increased by 1.3pc in January compared to the previous month, according to the Halifax house price index.It was the fourth monthly gain in a row after six consecutive falls before that.The survey found that average house prices increased to £291,029, which was £3,900 more than last month.Compared to the same month last year, property prices grew by 2.5pc, which was the highest annual growth since January 2023.Halifax Mortgages director Kim Kinnaird said:The recent reduction of mortgage rates from lenders as competition picks up, alongside fading inflationary pressures and a still-resilient labour market has contributed to increased confidence among buyers and sellers. This has resulted in a positive start to 2024’s housing market.However, while housing activity has increased over recent months, interest rates remain elevated compared to the historic lows seen in recent years and demand continues to exceed supply.For those looking to buy a first home, the average deposit raised is now £53,414, around 19pc of the purchase price. It’s not surprising that almost two thirds (63pc) of new buyers getting a foot on the ladder are now buying in joint names.Looking ahead, affordability challenges are likely to remain and further modest falls should not be ruled out, against a backdrop of broader uncertainty in the economic environment.Thanks for joining me. House prices increased for a fourth month in a row following the recent reduction in mortgage rates from lenders, according to the latest Halifax house price index.Average house prices increased to £291,029, which was £3,900 more than last month.1) Lockdown generation lacks basic workplace skills, says City grandee | Employers have noticed the negative impact on young recruits of lockdown measures, according to Baroness McGregor-Smith2) Bank of England pushed Britain into recession, economists say | Threadneedle Street has refused to communicate interest rates plan, economists say3) Why resurgent Ireland can’t afford to reunite – yet | Financial burden of absorbing the North could weigh down Dublin’s buoyant economy4) AI will trigger global surge in gas demand, says BP boss | Boom in tools such as ChatGPT means data centres require more power5) Jeremy Warner: The cost of lockdown is still becoming more devastating by the day | Young Britons will continue to pay the price of lost education for a generation to comeAsian stocks firmed on Wednesday as investors waited to see if Beijing’s increasingly frantic efforts to prop up its sagging share markets would actually work, while bonds enjoyed a reprieve from recent selling.In recent days, China’s regulators have announced further curbs on short selling and state investors said they were expanding their stock buying plans.Bloomberg News also reported President Xi Jinping would discuss the stock market with financial regulators, though there was no confirmation this had happened or what was discussed.However, the jury is very much out on how effective all this will prove and the blue chip index inched up 0.4% in choppy early trade, while Shanghai stocks added 0.9%.Tokyo’s blue-chip Nikkei shares drifted lower as investors digested corporate earnings.The benchmark Nikkei 225 index eased 0.1pc, or 40.74 points, to end at 36,119.92, while the broader Topix index added 0.4pc, or 10.70 points, at 2,549.95.Wall Street drifted higher during a quiet Tuesday as the bond market calmed down following some sharp swings.The S&P 500 rose 0.2pc, to 4,954.23, and nearly returned to its all-time high set at the end of last week.

Options Trader Wagers That Meta Shares Will Double Again`(Bloomberg) -- An options trader appears to be looking to parlay a winning bet on Meta Platforms Inc. into an even bigger windfall if the tech giant doubles — again — in the next 18 months.Most Read from BloombergHaley Loses Nevada Primary to ‘None of These Candidates’ OptionChina Replaces Top Markets Regulator as Xi Tries to End RoutTesla Asks Which Jobs Are Critical, Stoking Layoff FearsUS Commercial Real Estate Contagion Is Now Moving to EuropeTrump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals CourtEarly Wednesday, a trader sold a block of 19,000 call options that expire in June 2025 and allow the holder to purchase 1.9 million shares at $600, in exchange for twice as many calls with a $950 strike price expiring a year later, collecting $11.4 million.Holders of call options in Meta and other megacap tech stocks have seen ballooning profits, both from the increase in share prices that makes the options more valuable, but also the seeming unquenchable demand from investors looking to bet on further gains. Unlike most stocks, where there is a pronounced premium for bearish option contracts versus bullish as investors look to protect against losses, the incessant tech rally has flipped that on its head.“Meta is an example of a stock with skew to the calls,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group, adding that it’s rare to see this in an large cap equity and is an indication of “panic to the upside.”Selling the earlier calls — which appear to have been bought in mid-July when Meta was trading around $309 a share — likely netted millions of dollars in profits, though it’s hard to be sure as the position may have been rolled in July from an even lower level as shares rallied.While $950 seems like a far-away level, Meta shares doubled from November 2022 to March 2023, and doubled again between then and January.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went WrongThe Story Elon Musk Doesn’t Want to Talk AboutLayoffs Show That Tech Jobs Aren’t Sacred AnymoreHSBC’s New ‘Wise Killer’ App Vies for FX CustomersThe Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

Why Snap (SNAP) Stock Is Nosediving`Shares of social network Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) fell 34.5% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and average revenue per user (ARPU) missing analysts' expectations amid elevated expectations around changes in the direct response business. User growth was steady, with DAU (daily active users) ahead of estimates as net additions in Europe and the Rest of the World more than offset the customer attrition recorded in North America. This North America attrition is sure to ring alarm bells about competition, with Meta (NASDAQ:META) recently reporting very encouraging results.While next quarter's revenue guidance was in line, adjusted EBITDA guidance was well below. This shows that Snap's growth is coming at higher costs or less efficiency than expected. Moreover, the ARPU miss and the weakness in North America DAU indicate a challenging road ahead if the company aims to surpass expectations in the upcoming quarter. During the earnings call, management hinted at potential growth investments in North America and Europe and expressed optimism about avoiding further declines in North America in Q1. Overall, this was a mediocre quarter for Snap as the market was likely expecting more, considering the strong result reported by Meta earlier in the season.The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Snap? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.Snap's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 26 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Snap and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company gained 7.1% on the news that Meta reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector also suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024.Snap is down 29.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $11.33 per share it is trading 35.1% below its 52-week high of $17.45 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Snap's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,326.Do you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners`"In this article, we discuss 10 best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners. Global stocks reached their highest point in over two years, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record high on February 7, as per Reuters. This was driven by robust earnings, which helped counter concerns surrounding US regional banks and the Chinese markets. Bonds experienced slight pressure, as statements from Federal Reserve officials reinforced the expectation that the central bank might not reduce interest rates in the near future. According to Arthur Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth: ""We are at the midpoint of the 4Q earnings reporting season, and we would say that there has been more good news than bad.""In 2023, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 26.29%, recovering from the setback of 18.11% in 2022. In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts. The potential combination of declining interest rates and earnings growth is seen as a positive for stocks. However, analysts express worries about overvalued technology sector stocks, and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to introduce significant market volatility.Looking at historical data from 1921 to 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research, noted that the average S&P 500 bull market has yielded a return of 157% and lasted over four years. This historical pattern suggests the possibility of the stock market rally continuing in the foreseeable future. One notable success in the current bull market has been the performance of artificial intelligence technology as an investment theme. AI stocks were among the top performers in 2023, contributing to the market's overall positive trajectory. James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, commented: “The market’s recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI.” On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee suggests a more cautious outlook for 2024, anticipating an average year for markets rather than double-digit gains. Concerns include the S&P 500's elevated forward price/earnings ratio and a historically low equity risk premium. Valuations indicate potential sub-par annual stock returns, with estimates pointing to a 4% gain compared to the long-run average of 7%-8%. Analysts' optimistic projections for 2024 U.S. corporate earnings are questioned, with expectations of a tapering in economic growth from 7% to 4%. The market's assumption of a more aggressive Fed rate-cutting stance contrasts with public signals, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions as emergency programs wind down in 2024.Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, remarked: “As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.” Some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology For this list, we used a stock screener and selected stable companies with high single digit or low-teens revenue growth. Then, we arranged them via market cap to get the largest companies. We selected the top stocks for beginners based on revenue growth and hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter of 2023. The list is sorted in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders. Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Quarterly Revenue Growth: 14.10%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company in the United States with four segments – UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. UnitedHealthcare offers health benefit plans for employers and individuals, Medicaid plans, and children's health insurance.On January 12, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $6.16 and a revenue of $94.4 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.17 and $2.22 billion, respectively. Revenue for the period increased 14% on a year-over-year basis. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 104 hedge funds held stakes worth nearly $11 billion in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared to 111 funds in the prior quarter worth $10.1 billion. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.2 million shares worth $1.6 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best cheap stocks for beginners. Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) contributed less to portfolio performance than the majority of our holdings during the quarter. The Company reported double-digit revenue, operating earnings and earnings per share growth during their third quarter. The Company has been able to adjust pricing in its health care segment to keep up with medical cost inflation while working with its Optum units to deliver more value-based care that replaces the traditional fee for service health care model. Value-based care is a sensible, long-term growth opportunity for the Company to pursue and also differentiates it from the vast majority of healthcare providers, particularly as it relates to Medicare patients. For example, the Company’s value-based care programs provide more preventative care opportunities and home-based care visits for patients which helps save the U.S. healthcare system billions in unnecessary spending while also providing patients with better outcomes, as diseases and behaviors are caught or corrected at earlier stages. The Company has invested in several core assets over many years to execute this value-based strategy and it will become the standard of care as the proportion of people in the U.S. with healthcare insurance coverage continues to reach new highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.00%JPMorgan Chase & Co.

After a 31% For Vote on executive compensation in 2022, the Board will not be granting any special awards to Jamie Dimon or Daniel Pinto and if awarded to other Named Executive Officers, there will be a direct performance condition associated with the award. The Compensation Committee limited the cash percentage of Dimon and Pinto’s compensation.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Quarterly Revenue Growth: 10.20%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, and other products for data centers, gaming, and embedded applications. It is one of the best cheap beginner stocks to invest in. On February 1, Citi analyst Christopher Danely observed that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, anticipating $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi suggested that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) may intentionally be underestimating, and the company's CEO expressed confidence in surpassing the $3.5 billion figure for this year. The analyst estimated that AMD could generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from its MI300, according to buy-side investors' expectations.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion. White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.60%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), a diversified software company, operates globally through three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising.

The company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares during the fourth quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.30%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a global provider of customer relationship management technology, facilitating the connection between companies and customers. The company's services include sales tools for data management, lead monitoring, progress tracking, and analytics.

Sills highlighted Salesforce's competitive advantage with a significant market share of only 15% and a robust moat derived from its extensive installed base of over 150,000 customers in the core sales/front office category.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 122 hedge funds were bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), same as the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with roughly 15 million shares worth $4 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) ranks 6th on our list of the top cheap stocks for beginners in 2024. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners.  Suggested articles:Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks15 Best Bitcoin Wallets For iPhone and Android11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:51:38.902250`AMZN
Do Not Fight this Market: 3 Top Ranked Stock to Join the Rally`After such a strong finish in 2023 and follow through at the start of 2024, investors are wondering when the correction is coming. While it is natural to expect some sort of pull-back I think investors would be best off not trying to predict, and instead continue buying top-ranked stocks.Below we can see the Nasdaq 100 is breaking out of this bullish looking consolidation, and the S&P 500 is very nearly pushing through the 5,000 level.Image Source: TradingViewFurthermore, there are many powerful investment themes keeping the markets bid, including a robust economy, exciting technological developments, and tremendous government spending deficits. That last item is definitely worth considering when wondering when the economy is going to slowdown.Because of the massive spending behind the most recent infrastructure bill, where more than $1 trillion is going to be spent, many laid off workers are likely to be soaked up by the public sector, and spending to continue.Based on these influential economic developments, investors should focus on continuing to buy leading stocks with top Zacks ranks, because a major economic slowdown is becoming less and less likely.Here I will share three stocks with top Zacks ranks, and market beating performance over the last month. I particularly like to look for stocks showing relative strength while the market continues to grind higher.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMercadoLibreMercadoLibre MELI, is the Latin-American version of Amazon, building an e-commerce platform that continues to boom in popularity. MercadoLibre has been one of the most exciting stocks in the last few years and its returns continue to delight investors willing to own shares.In addition to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, the company is forecasting impressive growth in sales and earnings.This year, sales are expected to climb 36% YoY to $14.3 billion, while EPS are set to expand 134% to $22.30 per share. That growth is projected to continue on to the next year as well, with sales expected to grow 22.3% the following year, and EPS to increase 57.6%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to the fundamental developments in MercadoLibre, its technical advances are compelling as well. In addition to relative strength against the market, it has been forming a very nice technical trade pattern to measure a breakout trade from.For investors waiting for a technical signal to enter MELI, a move above $1764 would market a clean breakout from this bullish consolidation.Image Source: TradingViewStoneCoStoneCo STNE is a Brazilian financial technology company specializing in payment processing solutions. Founded in 2012, StoneCo provides a range of services, including electronic payments, credit card processing, and point-of-sale technology for businesses of varying sizes.StoneCo has seen earnings estimates steadily trend higher over the last 10 months, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Additionally, the company is entering a period where EPS are expected to expand significantly. Earnings are forecast to grow 167% YoY this year, and 36.1% next year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MercadoLibre, StoneCo stock is forming a convincing technical pattern. STNE stock was hit hard at the end of 2022 and traded sideways at a depressed level for nearly two years.However, at the end of 2023, the stock initiated a stage one breakout, indicating investors had been buying the depressed stock. Now over the last two months, STNE price action has built out a weekly bull flag, leading me to believe another big breakout is coming.If STNE stock trades above the $18.50 level, investors could rush in to buy the stock sending it significantly higher.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon.comFinally, one of the world's leading companies, Amazon AMZN just reported an incredibly strong quarter of financials sending the stock much higher.Following the earnings gap up, Amazon stock is forming a post earnings consolidation, a very high probability trading setup. Above $171 and AMZN should make a run at its all-time high.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon has also been garnering interest from analysts, who have been steadily upgrading earnings estimates. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 22% and current quarter earnings by 12.5%.Earnings at the e-commerce and technology giant are expected to grow by an impressive 28.1% annually over the next 3-5 years, driven by its AWS and new advertising business segments.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe great thing about investing in stocks is that the best ones offer tremendous asymmetric opportunities. There is no reason to try and predict market selloffs, because so long as you focus on buying top-tier securities, the returns take care of themselves. That is not to say that risk management isn’t key, but good investors are often optimists. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Down 61% in the Past Year, Has This E-Commerce Stock Entered Bargain Territory?`The last 12 months were a good period in general for e-commerce stocks. Companies like Amazon, Shopify, MercadoLibre, and Pinduoduo saw their share prices rise at least 30%.But the industry had its laggards too, including JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), which saw its shares fall 61% in the past year. With the stock now down 78% from its all-time high, JD.com has attracted some investors looking to take advantage of a potential bargain.But before you rush into the stock, you should understand how JD.com got here in the first place. Only then can you make an informed investment decision.JD.com is one of the more successful companies replicating Amazon's playbook.The e-commerce giant operates a first-party e-commerce business in China by selling a wide range of products directly to customers. It also operates a third-party marketplace that allows other sellers on its platform, in exchange for fees from each successful transaction.The company emphasizes low prices to encourage customers to buy more over time, and it operates a complex logistics service to offer speedy deliveries. The low prices and fast delivery leads to strong customer retention and sales growth, providing JD.com with the scale needed to drive prices even lower and continuously improve its service.Customers love the approach, which explains the company's uninterrupted growth for many years. For perspective, revenue grew revenue at a compound annual rate of 27% from 2017 to 2021. Everything seemed to be moving in the right direction until recently.Investors accustomed to such an impressive track record were disappointed when the e-commerce company reported just 10% revenue growth in 2022. Subsequent months were even more challenging for the company with revenue growth declining to just 2% in Q3 2023. Revenue from its flagship first-party e-commerce business actually fell 1% year over year, masked by a 13% increase in service revenue.To add salt to the wound, competitor PDD Holdings reported 94% top-line growth in the same quarter. Even Alibaba, which is facing its own challenges, reported 9% growth.JD.com is failing to keep up with the competition. It didn't help that previous CEO Xu Lei stepped down from his post in May 2023 after just one year, adding another layer of uncertainty to the company's future.The silver lining here is the fact the company is still profitable with a strong balance sheet. JD.com generated 39 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in free cash flow in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2023. It also had 242 billion yuan ($33.2 billion) in cash and short-term investments. With this solid financial position, JD.com can continue to invest in areas like live-streaming shopping, supply chain improvements, and other initiatives.Still, investors should be aware the path ahead remains challenging as it will have to outmaneuver rivals like Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and Douyin.So JD.com is at a crossroads. Despite its previous success, the future is far less certain now that it faces a more competitive industry and greater regulatory scrutiny.Given the recent bearish sentiment, JD.com stock trades at a significant discount to other e-commerce companies with a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is just 10.2, while Pinduoduo trades at 27.8 times earnings.Investors should monitor JD.com's rebound efforts in the coming quarters for clues of its progress. If the company can defend its position as a top three e-commerce platform in China and rekindle growth, its current stock price should prove to be a bargain.Should you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?Before you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JD.com wasn’t one of them.

3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now`"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is off to a great start in 2024. The e-commerce giant is making progress along all fronts of its multifaceted business, and its stock is up 66% over the past year.You might not realize that it's still trading below all-time highs. But the way things are going, Amazon stock is likely to surpass that in the coming months, and now is a great time to buy it.Here are three specific reasons to be confident about Amazon stock this year.Amazon made a strategic decision last year to restructure its distribution network from a national one to a regional one. The rationale was that the national network was large and cumbersome, making it take longer, on average, to get products to customers. A regional network stocked with high-selling items would get products to customers faster and at a lower cost.It now has eight regional distribution centers, and the results speak for themselves. In the 2023 fourth quarter, Amazon delivered 65% more items overnight than in the prior year. CEO Andy Jassy noted that as Amazon fulfills orders faster, customers choose it for more orders.In a first since 2018, Amazon has decreased its per-unit cost to fulfill globally, and in the U.S., fulfillment cost per unit decreased by more than $0.45 from last year. This allows Amazon to expand its selection profitably at lower average selling prices, improving its chances of gaining market share.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud services arm. Until recently, AWS sales were reliable to grow at rates around 35% in a typical quarter. That began to drop when inflation became severe, and client businesses started to cut their budgets.However, Amazon continues to lead the industry with 32% of the overall market according to Statista, and sales growth improved in the fourth quarter to 13% year over year. Jassy said the company is seeing larger deals accelerate; it announced several new deals with companies like Salesforce, BMW, and Nvidia.The company launched a robust suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services for AWS, and adoption rates are strong. The company offers three layers of AI to meet the varied needs of its clients, from the most customizable to partially customizable, with the top layer being a generative AI ""coded companion."" Last week, Amazon launched Rufus, a personal shopping generative AI application that takes customer queries and offers product recommendations based on requirements.Jassy said Amazon will continue to invest heavily in AI since it offers the opportunity to revolutionize the shopping and processing experience for its customers, and it sees this as a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years.Amazon only started to break out advertising as its own business segment in late 2021, when it grew 32% year over year, trailing AWS at 40%. With the other businesses slowing down, advertising has become the fastest-growing reporting segment, increasing 26% over last year in the 2023 fourth quarter. That was driven by sponsored ads.Advertising is a no-brainer for Amazon third-party sellers since it exposes them to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers. Amazon's top AI helps them target potential buyers with high accuracy.Amazon recently changed its streaming program to an ad-supported track, like Netflix and Walt Disney, which should pump up this segment even more. This will likely remain a strong business for Amazon in the near term, and as advertisers revisit their budgets after inflation-induced cuts, they're liable to spend more. Some percentage of that will go to Amazon.These are only part of the story. Amazon is making strides in smaller endeavors like cashierless stores, healthcare, and more. 2024 could be a banner year for Amazon, and in the long term, it's likely to add value to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks`"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 5 Stocks.Jim Cramer said in a latest program that after listening to the Fed chair Jerome Powell he believes we are at ""crossroads"" since there is still ""some inflation"" and the ""dichotomy"" of hard landing versus soft landing is being ""replaced by no landing."" Cramer said that we are ""back to reality"" and the reality, according to Cramer, is that interest rates are still ""not that high."" Cramer believes the rates are at a level where the economy can keep working. Cramer wondered how and why the Fed would cut interest rates when strong employment numbers keep coming and inflation is also not going down significantly.Jim Cramer tried to convince his viewers to invest in the stock market and said that while it would seem ""reckless"" to invest in the stock market because of the risks involved, it would be ""too late"" to invest in stocks once the Fed begins to cut interest rates. Jim Cramer said that stocks are in a win-win situation. If the economy keeps growing and the market remains strong, stocks will go up. If the economy begins to slow down, the Fed would cut rates sometime in the future, causing a rally in the stock market. Jim Cramer, however, acknowledged that stocks are risky when compared to the steady 5% income on CDs.Cramer said ""great"" stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can give you that ""5% from CDs"" in ""a week or even a day.""Cramer said that he has ""no illusions"" and he is convinced that now is the right time to buy stocks. Cramer said he thinks many investors would be inclined towards investing in low-risk index funds or parking their cash in CDs or treasuries but he thinks big money will be made by investing in individual stocks.But Jim Cramer is not bullish on all stocks. In fact over the past couple of years or so he's become quite selective in his choices and keeps recommending investors to sell or stay away from low-quality, money-losing or risky stocks and instead buy best of breed and high quality stocks.In this article we will talk about some stocks Cramer is bearish on.MethodologyFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to either stay away from or sell. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment where available. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/ASports and outdoor equipment company Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) recently went public in an IPO that fell short of expectations. Cramer had advised investors to stay away from the stock. He said:“So far, this is looking like another out of favor IPO, even if its lowball price allowed the stock to get a like, I guess you could call it a decent pop. And, I’ve got to tell you, Amer Sports is a great example of the kind of deals I wish we weren’t seeing.”One of the reasons why Cramer is bearish on Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) is the company's high exposure to China.While Cramer is bearish on the stock, Canadian billionaire Chip Wilson, who also founded Lululemon Athletica, bought $324 million worth of shares at the company’s IPO.While Cramer is bearish on companies like Amer Sports, he's recommending buying high-quality mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 9Last month, Jim Cramer was asked about Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC). Cramer recommended the questioner to ""take a pass"" on the stock. Cramer said the ""greatest inventor of our time"" Elon Musk does not like lithium companies and he is trying to figure out a way to cut our dependence on them. Cramer said he would not go against Musk.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Surgical facilities company Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on these days. When asked about Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) in a recent program on CNBC, Cramer said ""that industry is in up and down right now.""""I'm taking a hard pass,"" Cramer said of Surgery Partners.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The biggest stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is owned by Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $157 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22Jim Cramer in a recent program said he hasn’t ""liked Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) in 20 years, and it’s really rewarded my dislike.""Cramer said instead of Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) he's ""willing"" to recommend Verizon.Insider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 22 hedge funds had stakes in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD). The biggest stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) is owned by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP which owns a $37 million stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24Gene editing platform company CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) ranks sixth in our list of stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from.While Cramer said that he ""likes"" CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), the reason why he cannot recommend the stock is that CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) has been losing a lot of money. Cramer said he cannot recommend CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) stock on a ""fundamental basis.""The stock has gained about 17% over the past one year. Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) said the US FDA approved its groundbreaking gene editing therapy, Casgevy, developed with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) for those aged 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT).Unlike Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Cramer likes a lot, the CNBC host is bearish on CRSP.

3 Inspiring Underdogs That Fought Tech Giants and Won`"When it comes to success in emerging industries, size usually matters. Pioneers often fail, leaving behind the foundation for larger players to dominate. Thankfully for investors in mold-breaking upstarts, it doesn't always play out that way.Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Sonos (NASDAQ: SONO), and Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) are three companies that saw Apple and other consumer tech behemoths try to take them out. The little guys are not just surviving, but thriving against established titans with almost limitless resources. Take a bow Roku, Sonos, and Spotify.Roku founder Anthony Wood invented the digital video recorder, but it was another company that enjoyed the DVR glory. He got it right when he launched Roku a few years later, pioneering the streaming video revolution. It wasn't long before Roku was joined by some of the most valuable companies on the planet. Apple TV, Alphabet's Google Chromecast, and Amazon's Fire TV hit the market. Roku didn't flinch.Roku remains the leading operating system for smart TVs in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It has roughly double the market share of its closest rival. It doesn't matter that Google and Amazon are willing to practically give away the hardware to get folks connected. Roku has been able to sacrifice product margins, knowing it can make it up in volume.Roku is free to use, making the lion's share of its revenue from ad sharing and referrals. It's working. Average revenue per user is more than $41 over the past year. There are 75.8 million active accounts on the platform, and boy are they active. Roku users are spending an average of 3.8 hours a day streaming through the Roku hub.It doesn't seem possible. Roku is competing against Apple, a company that is used to getting people to pay a premium for its wares. Alphabet is the global leader in online advertising, putting it in the perfect position to cash in on an ad-supported industry. Amazon is the top dog in online retail, and it aggressively promotes its Fire TV dongles and smart TVs on its platform. Roku is still beating them all.Roku's enemies are also rivals of Sonos. It was 2005 when Sonos rolled out the first wireless multiroom speaker system, which streams audio seamlessly through a home. Audiophiles flocked to Sonos, but then familiar foes emerged. Apple, Amazon, and Google all had cheap smart speakers in support of their virtual assistant technologies. Sonos was in their crosshairs if they chose to go upmarket, but they missed.Sonos would go on to deliver 17 consecutive years of revenue growth before proving mortal in fiscal 2023. On Tuesday afternoon it posted financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. It was a well-received report.Revenue declined 9%, or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. It's not pretty, but analysts were bracing for a 13% decline. The bigger surprise is at the other end of the income statement. Profitability improved at Sonos, earning $0.64 a share for the seasonally potent holiday quarter, up from $0.57 a share a year earlier. Wall Street pros were settling for a sharp decline to $0.39 a share.""Despite the challenging environment, we are winning in the market and outperforming the competition,"" CEO Patrick Spence said in this week's earnings report.Rich in cash and patents, Sonos is well positioned to continue dominating its high-end niche. With analyst profit targets now likely headed higher, Sonos is cheap.Remember when everyone figured that Spotify was toast? The Swedish audio streaming service was making waves worldwide, but would it be able to succeed in the U.S. as Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Amazon Music flooded the market? It's doing pretty well, even if it had to go through three rounds of layoffs last year.There are 602 million mostly ad-supported monthly active users, a 23% increase over the past year. Getting folks to pay is the more difficult nut to crack, but Spotify has been beefing up its catalog of original content to go with its industry-leading music platform. Premium Spotify accounts have risen 15% over the past year to reach 236 million.Apple and Amazon are distant competitors. Google Play Music threw in the towel, handing its digital ambitions over to YouTube Music. It's going to be hard for the other streaming service stocks to catch up to Spotify now.Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners`"In this article, we discuss 10 best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners. Global stocks reached their highest point in over two years, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record high on February 7, as per Reuters. This was driven by robust earnings, which helped counter concerns surrounding US regional banks and the Chinese markets. Bonds experienced slight pressure, as statements from Federal Reserve officials reinforced the expectation that the central bank might not reduce interest rates in the near future. According to Arthur Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth: ""We are at the midpoint of the 4Q earnings reporting season, and we would say that there has been more good news than bad.""In 2023, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 26.29%, recovering from the setback of 18.11% in 2022. In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts. The potential combination of declining interest rates and earnings growth is seen as a positive for stocks. However, analysts express worries about overvalued technology sector stocks, and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to introduce significant market volatility.Looking at historical data from 1921 to 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research, noted that the average S&P 500 bull market has yielded a return of 157% and lasted over four years. This historical pattern suggests the possibility of the stock market rally continuing in the foreseeable future. One notable success in the current bull market has been the performance of artificial intelligence technology as an investment theme. AI stocks were among the top performers in 2023, contributing to the market's overall positive trajectory. James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, commented: “The market’s recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI.” On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee suggests a more cautious outlook for 2024, anticipating an average year for markets rather than double-digit gains. Concerns include the S&P 500's elevated forward price/earnings ratio and a historically low equity risk premium. Valuations indicate potential sub-par annual stock returns, with estimates pointing to a 4% gain compared to the long-run average of 7%-8%. Analysts' optimistic projections for 2024 U.S. corporate earnings are questioned, with expectations of a tapering in economic growth from 7% to 4%. The market's assumption of a more aggressive Fed rate-cutting stance contrasts with public signals, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions as emergency programs wind down in 2024.Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, remarked: “As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.” Some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology For this list, we used a stock screener and selected stable companies with high single digit or low-teens revenue growth. Then, we arranged them via market cap to get the largest companies. We selected the top stocks for beginners based on revenue growth and hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter of 2023. The list is sorted in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders. Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Quarterly Revenue Growth: 14.10%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company in the United States with four segments – UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. UnitedHealthcare offers health benefit plans for employers and individuals, Medicaid plans, and children's health insurance.On January 12, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $6.16 and a revenue of $94.4 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.17 and $2.22 billion, respectively. Revenue for the period increased 14% on a year-over-year basis. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 104 hedge funds held stakes worth nearly $11 billion in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared to 111 funds in the prior quarter worth $10.1 billion. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.2 million shares worth $1.6 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best cheap stocks for beginners. Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) contributed less to portfolio performance than the majority of our holdings during the quarter. The Company reported double-digit revenue, operating earnings and earnings per share growth during their third quarter. The Company has been able to adjust pricing in its health care segment to keep up with medical cost inflation while working with its Optum units to deliver more value-based care that replaces the traditional fee for service health care model. Value-based care is a sensible, long-term growth opportunity for the Company to pursue and also differentiates it from the vast majority of healthcare providers, particularly as it relates to Medicare patients. For example, the Company’s value-based care programs provide more preventative care opportunities and home-based care visits for patients which helps save the U.S. healthcare system billions in unnecessary spending while also providing patients with better outcomes, as diseases and behaviors are caught or corrected at earlier stages. The Company has invested in several core assets over many years to execute this value-based strategy and it will become the standard of care as the proportion of people in the U.S. with healthcare insurance coverage continues to reach new highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.00%JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a global financial services company operating in four segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management. It is one of the top cheap beginner stocks to watch. On February 6, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced that it intends to initiate a substantial expansion over the next three years, involving the commencement of 500 new branches, renovation of 1,700 locations, and the hiring of 3,500 staff members. The expansion will focus on reaching low-income and rural communities in new markets. Upon completion, this initiative will result in over 1,100 added branches and more than 10,500 new hires in its Consumer Bank team since 2018. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 109 hedge funds were long JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), compared to 106 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 11.3 million shares worth $1.65 billion. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We updated the sustainable scorecard for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). JP Morgan continues to have an Average rating across Governance, Social and Environmental factors. JP Morgan is using its business to improve climate change. JP Morgan has targeted $2.5 trillion in financing between 2021 and 2030 to advance long-term solutions to address climate change and sustainable development. The Board has oversight of corporate responsibility and ESG matters, but ESG and Sustainability are addressed across the firm. JPM does listen to shareholders. After a 31% For Vote on executive compensation in 2022, the Board will not be granting any special awards to Jamie Dimon or Daniel Pinto and if awarded to other Named Executive Officers, there will be a direct performance condition associated with the award. The Compensation Committee limited the cash percentage of Dimon and Pinto’s compensation.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Quarterly Revenue Growth: 10.20%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, and other products for data centers, gaming, and embedded applications. It is one of the best cheap beginner stocks to invest in. On February 1, Citi analyst Christopher Danely observed that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, anticipating $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi suggested that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) may intentionally be underestimating, and the company's CEO expressed confidence in surpassing the $3.5 billion figure for this year. The analyst estimated that AMD could generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from its MI300, according to buy-side investors' expectations.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion. White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.60%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), a diversified software company, operates globally through three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. The Digital Media segment offers products and services for content creation and promotion, including the flagship product Creative Cloud. The Digital Experience segment provides a platform for brands and businesses to manage and optimize customer experiences. The Publishing and Advertising segment offers various products and services, such as e-learning solutions and Advertising Cloud offerings. On December 13, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $4.27 and a revenue of $5.05 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.13 and $30 million, respectively. The company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares during the fourth quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.30%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a global provider of customer relationship management technology, facilitating the connection between companies and customers. The company's services include sales tools for data management, lead monitoring, progress tracking, and analytics. Salesforce also offers a platform allowing businesses to build custom apps, an online learning platform, and Slack for collaboration. On January 30, BofA designated Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) as one of their top picks for 2024. According to BofA Analyst Brad Sills, Salesforce is strategically positioned to further gain market share in the cumulative $200 billion market. Sills highlighted Salesforce's competitive advantage with a significant market share of only 15% and a robust moat derived from its extensive installed base of over 150,000 customers in the core sales/front office category.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 122 hedge funds were bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), same as the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with roughly 15 million shares worth $4 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) ranks 6th on our list of the top cheap stocks for beginners in 2024. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners.  Suggested articles:Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks15 Best Bitcoin Wallets For iPhone and Android11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:53:56.471555`AMZN
Do Not Fight this Market: 3 Top Ranked Stock to Join the Rally`After such a strong finish in 2023 and follow through at the start of 2024, investors are wondering when the correction is coming. While it is natural to expect some sort of pull-back I think investors would be best off not trying to predict, and instead continue buying top-ranked stocks.Below we can see the Nasdaq 100 is breaking out of this bullish looking consolidation, and the S&P 500 is very nearly pushing through the 5,000 level.Image Source: TradingViewFurthermore, there are many powerful investment themes keeping the markets bid, including a robust economy, exciting technological developments, and tremendous government spending deficits. That last item is definitely worth considering when wondering when the economy is going to slowdown.Because of the massive spending behind the most recent infrastructure bill, where more than $1 trillion is going to be spent, many laid off workers are likely to be soaked up by the public sector, and spending to continue.Based on these influential economic developments, investors should focus on continuing to buy leading stocks with top Zacks ranks, because a major economic slowdown is becoming less and less likely.Here I will share three stocks with top Zacks ranks, and market beating performance over the last month. I particularly like to look for stocks showing relative strength while the market continues to grind higher.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMercadoLibreMercadoLibre MELI, is the Latin-American version of Amazon, building an e-commerce platform that continues to boom in popularity. MercadoLibre has been one of the most exciting stocks in the last few years and its returns continue to delight investors willing to own shares.In addition to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, the company is forecasting impressive growth in sales and earnings.This year, sales are expected to climb 36% YoY to $14.3 billion, while EPS are set to expand 134% to $22.30 per share. That growth is projected to continue on to the next year as well, with sales expected to grow 22.3% the following year, and EPS to increase 57.6%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to the fundamental developments in MercadoLibre, its technical advances are compelling as well. In addition to relative strength against the market, it has been forming a very nice technical trade pattern to measure a breakout trade from.For investors waiting for a technical signal to enter MELI, a move above $1764 would market a clean breakout from this bullish consolidation.Image Source: TradingViewStoneCoStoneCo STNE is a Brazilian financial technology company specializing in payment processing solutions. Founded in 2012, StoneCo provides a range of services, including electronic payments, credit card processing, and point-of-sale technology for businesses of varying sizes.StoneCo has seen earnings estimates steadily trend higher over the last 10 months, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Additionally, the company is entering a period where EPS are expected to expand significantly. Earnings are forecast to grow 167% YoY this year, and 36.1% next year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MercadoLibre, StoneCo stock is forming a convincing technical pattern. STNE stock was hit hard at the end of 2022 and traded sideways at a depressed level for nearly two years.However, at the end of 2023, the stock initiated a stage one breakout, indicating investors had been buying the depressed stock. Now over the last two months, STNE price action has built out a weekly bull flag, leading me to believe another big breakout is coming.If STNE stock trades above the $18.50 level, investors could rush in to buy the stock sending it significantly higher.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon.comFinally, one of the world's leading companies, Amazon AMZN just reported an incredibly strong quarter of financials sending the stock much higher.Following the earnings gap up, Amazon stock is forming a post earnings consolidation, a very high probability trading setup. Above $171 and AMZN should make a run at its all-time high.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon has also been garnering interest from analysts, who have been steadily upgrading earnings estimates. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 22% and current quarter earnings by 12.5%.Earnings at the e-commerce and technology giant are expected to grow by an impressive 28.1% annually over the next 3-5 years, driven by its AWS and new advertising business segments.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe great thing about investing in stocks is that the best ones offer tremendous asymmetric opportunities. There is no reason to try and predict market selloffs, because so long as you focus on buying top-tier securities, the returns take care of themselves. That is not to say that risk management isn’t key, but good investors are often optimists. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Down 61% in the Past Year, Has This E-Commerce Stock Entered Bargain Territory?`The last 12 months were a good period in general for e-commerce stocks. Companies like Amazon, Shopify, MercadoLibre, and Pinduoduo saw their share prices rise at least 30%.But the industry had its laggards too, including JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), which saw its shares fall 61% in the past year. With the stock now down 78% from its all-time high, JD.com has attracted some investors looking to take advantage of a potential bargain.But before you rush into the stock, you should understand how JD.com got here in the first place. Only then can you make an informed investment decision.JD.com is one of the more successful companies replicating Amazon's playbook.The e-commerce giant operates a first-party e-commerce business in China by selling a wide range of products directly to customers. It also operates a third-party marketplace that allows other sellers on its platform, in exchange for fees from each successful transaction.The company emphasizes low prices to encourage customers to buy more over time, and it operates a complex logistics service to offer speedy deliveries. The low prices and fast delivery leads to strong customer retention and sales growth, providing JD.com with the scale needed to drive prices even lower and continuously improve its service.Customers love the approach, which explains the company's uninterrupted growth for many years. For perspective, revenue grew revenue at a compound annual rate of 27% from 2017 to 2021. Everything seemed to be moving in the right direction until recently.Investors accustomed to such an impressive track record were disappointed when the e-commerce company reported just 10% revenue growth in 2022. Subsequent months were even more challenging for the company with revenue growth declining to just 2% in Q3 2023. Revenue from its flagship first-party e-commerce business actually fell 1% year over year, masked by a 13% increase in service revenue.To add salt to the wound, competitor PDD Holdings reported 94% top-line growth in the same quarter. Even Alibaba, which is facing its own challenges, reported 9% growth.JD.com is failing to keep up with the competition. It didn't help that previous CEO Xu Lei stepped down from his post in May 2023 after just one year, adding another layer of uncertainty to the company's future.The silver lining here is the fact the company is still profitable with a strong balance sheet. JD.com generated 39 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in free cash flow in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2023. It also had 242 billion yuan ($33.2 billion) in cash and short-term investments. With this solid financial position, JD.com can continue to invest in areas like live-streaming shopping, supply chain improvements, and other initiatives.Still, investors should be aware the path ahead remains challenging as it will have to outmaneuver rivals like Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and Douyin.So JD.com is at a crossroads. Despite its previous success, the future is far less certain now that it faces a more competitive industry and greater regulatory scrutiny.Given the recent bearish sentiment, JD.com stock trades at a significant discount to other e-commerce companies with a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is just 10.2, while Pinduoduo trades at 27.8 times earnings.Investors should monitor JD.com's rebound efforts in the coming quarters for clues of its progress. If the company can defend its position as a top three e-commerce platform in China and rekindle growth, its current stock price should prove to be a bargain.Should you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?Before you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JD.com wasn’t one of them.

3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now`"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is off to a great start in 2024. The e-commerce giant is making progress along all fronts of its multifaceted business, and its stock is up 66% over the past year.You might not realize that it's still trading below all-time highs. But the way things are going, Amazon stock is likely to surpass that in the coming months, and now is a great time to buy it.Here are three specific reasons to be confident about Amazon stock this year.Amazon made a strategic decision last year to restructure its distribution network from a national one to a regional one. The rationale was that the national network was large and cumbersome, making it take longer, on average, to get products to customers. A regional network stocked with high-selling items would get products to customers faster and at a lower cost.It now has eight regional distribution centers, and the results speak for themselves. In the 2023 fourth quarter, Amazon delivered 65% more items overnight than in the prior year. CEO Andy Jassy noted that as Amazon fulfills orders faster, customers choose it for more orders.In a first since 2018, Amazon has decreased its per-unit cost to fulfill globally, and in the U.S., fulfillment cost per unit decreased by more than $0.45 from last year. This allows Amazon to expand its selection profitably at lower average selling prices, improving its chances of gaining market share.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud services arm. Until recently, AWS sales were reliable to grow at rates around 35% in a typical quarter. That began to drop when inflation became severe, and client businesses started to cut their budgets.However, Amazon continues to lead the industry with 32% of the overall market according to Statista, and sales growth improved in the fourth quarter to 13% year over year. Jassy said the company is seeing larger deals accelerate; it announced several new deals with companies like Salesforce, BMW, and Nvidia.The company launched a robust suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services for AWS, and adoption rates are strong. The company offers three layers of AI to meet the varied needs of its clients, from the most customizable to partially customizable, with the top layer being a generative AI ""coded companion."" Last week, Amazon launched Rufus, a personal shopping generative AI application that takes customer queries and offers product recommendations based on requirements.Jassy said Amazon will continue to invest heavily in AI since it offers the opportunity to revolutionize the shopping and processing experience for its customers, and it sees this as a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years.Amazon only started to break out advertising as its own business segment in late 2021, when it grew 32% year over year, trailing AWS at 40%. With the other businesses slowing down, advertising has become the fastest-growing reporting segment, increasing 26% over last year in the 2023 fourth quarter. That was driven by sponsored ads.Advertising is a no-brainer for Amazon third-party sellers since it exposes them to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers. Amazon's top AI helps them target potential buyers with high accuracy.Amazon recently changed its streaming program to an ad-supported track, like Netflix and Walt Disney, which should pump up this segment even more. This will likely remain a strong business for Amazon in the near term, and as advertisers revisit their budgets after inflation-induced cuts, they're liable to spend more. Some percentage of that will go to Amazon.These are only part of the story. Amazon is making strides in smaller endeavors like cashierless stores, healthcare, and more. 2024 could be a banner year for Amazon, and in the long term, it's likely to add value to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Cramer said that we are ""back to reality"" and the reality, according to Cramer, is that interest rates are still ""not that high."" Cramer believes the rates are at a level where the economy can keep working. Cramer wondered how and why the Fed would cut interest rates when strong employment numbers keep coming and inflation is also not going down significantly.Jim Cramer tried to convince his viewers to invest in the stock market and said that while it would seem ""reckless"" to invest in the stock market because of the risks involved, it would be ""too late"" to invest in stocks once the Fed begins to cut interest rates. Jim Cramer said that stocks are in a win-win situation. If the economy keeps growing and the market remains strong, stocks will go up. If the economy begins to slow down, the Fed would cut rates sometime in the future, causing a rally in the stock market. Jim Cramer, however, acknowledged that stocks are risky when compared to the steady 5% income on CDs.Cramer said ""great"" stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can give you that ""5% from CDs"" in ""a week or even a day.""Cramer said that he has ""no illusions"" and he is convinced that now is the right time to buy stocks. Cramer said he thinks many investors would be inclined towards investing in low-risk index funds or parking their cash in CDs or treasuries but he thinks big money will be made by investing in individual stocks.But Jim Cramer is not bullish on all stocks. In fact over the past couple of years or so he's become quite selective in his choices and keeps recommending investors to sell or stay away from low-quality, money-losing or risky stocks and instead buy best of breed and high quality stocks.In this article we will talk about some stocks Cramer is bearish on.MethodologyFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to either stay away from or sell. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment where available. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/ASports and outdoor equipment company Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) recently went public in an IPO that fell short of expectations. Cramer had advised investors to stay away from the stock. He said:“So far, this is looking like another out of favor IPO, even if its lowball price allowed the stock to get a like, I guess you could call it a decent pop. And, I’ve got to tell you, Amer Sports is a great example of the kind of deals I wish we weren’t seeing.”One of the reasons why Cramer is bearish on Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) is the company's high exposure to China.While Cramer is bearish on the stock, Canadian billionaire Chip Wilson, who also founded Lululemon Athletica, bought $324 million worth of shares at the company’s IPO.While Cramer is bearish on companies like Amer Sports, he's recommending buying high-quality mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 9Last month, Jim Cramer was asked about Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC). Cramer recommended the questioner to ""take a pass"" on the stock. Cramer said the ""greatest inventor of our time"" Elon Musk does not like lithium companies and he is trying to figure out a way to cut our dependence on them. Cramer said he would not go against Musk.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Surgical facilities company Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on these days. When asked about Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) in a recent program on CNBC, Cramer said ""that industry is in up and down right now.""""I'm taking a hard pass,"" Cramer said of Surgery Partners.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The biggest stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is owned by Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $157 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22Jim Cramer in a recent program said he hasn’t ""liked Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) in 20 years, and it’s really rewarded my dislike.""Cramer said instead of Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) he's ""willing"" to recommend Verizon.Insider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 22 hedge funds had stakes in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD). The biggest stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) is owned by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP which owns a $37 million stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24Gene editing platform company CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) ranks sixth in our list of stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from.While Cramer said that he ""likes"" CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), the reason why he cannot recommend the stock is that CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) has been losing a lot of money. Cramer said he cannot recommend CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) stock on a ""fundamental basis.""The stock has gained about 17% over the past one year. Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) said the US FDA approved its groundbreaking gene editing therapy, Casgevy, developed with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) for those aged 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT).Unlike Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Cramer likes a lot, the CNBC host is bearish on CRSP.

3 Inspiring Underdogs That Fought Tech Giants and Won`"When it comes to success in emerging industries, size usually matters. Pioneers often fail, leaving behind the foundation for larger players to dominate. Thankfully for investors in mold-breaking upstarts, it doesn't always play out that way.Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Sonos (NASDAQ: SONO), and Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) are three companies that saw Apple and other consumer tech behemoths try to take them out. The little guys are not just surviving, but thriving against established titans with almost limitless resources. Take a bow Roku, Sonos, and Spotify.Roku founder Anthony Wood invented the digital video recorder, but it was another company that enjoyed the DVR glory. He got it right when he launched Roku a few years later, pioneering the streaming video revolution. It wasn't long before Roku was joined by some of the most valuable companies on the planet. Apple TV, Alphabet's Google Chromecast, and Amazon's Fire TV hit the market. Roku didn't flinch.Roku remains the leading operating system for smart TVs in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It has roughly double the market share of its closest rival. It doesn't matter that Google and Amazon are willing to practically give away the hardware to get folks connected. Roku has been able to sacrifice product margins, knowing it can make it up in volume.Roku is free to use, making the lion's share of its revenue from ad sharing and referrals. It's working. Average revenue per user is more than $41 over the past year. There are 75.8 million active accounts on the platform, and boy are they active. Roku users are spending an average of 3.8 hours a day streaming through the Roku hub.It doesn't seem possible. Roku is competing against Apple, a company that is used to getting people to pay a premium for its wares. Alphabet is the global leader in online advertising, putting it in the perfect position to cash in on an ad-supported industry. Amazon is the top dog in online retail, and it aggressively promotes its Fire TV dongles and smart TVs on its platform. Roku is still beating them all.Roku's enemies are also rivals of Sonos. It was 2005 when Sonos rolled out the first wireless multiroom speaker system, which streams audio seamlessly through a home. Audiophiles flocked to Sonos, but then familiar foes emerged. Apple, Amazon, and Google all had cheap smart speakers in support of their virtual assistant technologies. Sonos was in their crosshairs if they chose to go upmarket, but they missed.Sonos would go on to deliver 17 consecutive years of revenue growth before proving mortal in fiscal 2023. On Tuesday afternoon it posted financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. It was a well-received report.Revenue declined 9%, or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. It's not pretty, but analysts were bracing for a 13% decline. The bigger surprise is at the other end of the income statement. Profitability improved at Sonos, earning $0.64 a share for the seasonally potent holiday quarter, up from $0.57 a share a year earlier. Wall Street pros were settling for a sharp decline to $0.39 a share.""Despite the challenging environment, we are winning in the market and outperforming the competition,"" CEO Patrick Spence said in this week's earnings report.Rich in cash and patents, Sonos is well positioned to continue dominating its high-end niche. With analyst profit targets now likely headed higher, Sonos is cheap.Remember when everyone figured that Spotify was toast? The Swedish audio streaming service was making waves worldwide, but would it be able to succeed in the U.S. as Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Amazon Music flooded the market? It's doing pretty well, even if it had to go through three rounds of layoffs last year.There are 602 million mostly ad-supported monthly active users, a 23% increase over the past year. Getting folks to pay is the more difficult nut to crack, but Spotify has been beefing up its catalog of original content to go with its industry-leading music platform. Premium Spotify accounts have risen 15% over the past year to reach 236 million.Apple and Amazon are distant competitors. Google Play Music threw in the towel, handing its digital ambitions over to YouTube Music. It's going to be hard for the other streaming service stocks to catch up to Spotify now.Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners`"In this article, we discuss 10 best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners. Global stocks reached their highest point in over two years, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record high on February 7, as per Reuters. This was driven by robust earnings, which helped counter concerns surrounding US regional banks and the Chinese markets. Bonds experienced slight pressure, as statements from Federal Reserve officials reinforced the expectation that the central bank might not reduce interest rates in the near future. According to Arthur Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth: ""We are at the midpoint of the 4Q earnings reporting season, and we would say that there has been more good news than bad.""In 2023, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 26.29%, recovering from the setback of 18.11% in 2022. In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts. The potential combination of declining interest rates and earnings growth is seen as a positive for stocks. However, analysts express worries about overvalued technology sector stocks, and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to introduce significant market volatility.Looking at historical data from 1921 to 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research, noted that the average S&P 500 bull market has yielded a return of 157% and lasted over four years. This historical pattern suggests the possibility of the stock market rally continuing in the foreseeable future. One notable success in the current bull market has been the performance of artificial intelligence technology as an investment theme. AI stocks were among the top performers in 2023, contributing to the market's overall positive trajectory. James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, commented: “The market’s recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI.” On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee suggests a more cautious outlook for 2024, anticipating an average year for markets rather than double-digit gains. Concerns include the S&P 500's elevated forward price/earnings ratio and a historically low equity risk premium. Valuations indicate potential sub-par annual stock returns, with estimates pointing to a 4% gain compared to the long-run average of 7%-8%. Analysts' optimistic projections for 2024 U.S. corporate earnings are questioned, with expectations of a tapering in economic growth from 7% to 4%. The market's assumption of a more aggressive Fed rate-cutting stance contrasts with public signals, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions as emergency programs wind down in 2024.Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, remarked: “As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.” Some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology For this list, we used a stock screener and selected stable companies with high single digit or low-teens revenue growth. Then, we arranged them via market cap to get the largest companies. We selected the top stocks for beginners based on revenue growth and hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter of 2023. The list is sorted in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders. Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Quarterly Revenue Growth: 14.10%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company in the United States with four segments – UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. UnitedHealthcare offers health benefit plans for employers and individuals, Medicaid plans, and children's health insurance.On January 12, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $6.16 and a revenue of $94.4 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.17 and $2.22 billion, respectively. Revenue for the period increased 14% on a year-over-year basis. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 104 hedge funds held stakes worth nearly $11 billion in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared to 111 funds in the prior quarter worth $10.1 billion. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.2 million shares worth $1.6 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best cheap stocks for beginners. Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) contributed less to portfolio performance than the majority of our holdings during the quarter. The Company reported double-digit revenue, operating earnings and earnings per share growth during their third quarter. The Company has been able to adjust pricing in its health care segment to keep up with medical cost inflation while working with its Optum units to deliver more value-based care that replaces the traditional fee for service health care model. Value-based care is a sensible, long-term growth opportunity for the Company to pursue and also differentiates it from the vast majority of healthcare providers, particularly as it relates to Medicare patients. For example, the Company’s value-based care programs provide more preventative care opportunities and home-based care visits for patients which helps save the U.S. healthcare system billions in unnecessary spending while also providing patients with better outcomes, as diseases and behaviors are caught or corrected at earlier stages. The Company has invested in several core assets over many years to execute this value-based strategy and it will become the standard of care as the proportion of people in the U.S. with healthcare insurance coverage continues to reach new highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.00%JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a global financial services company operating in four segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management. It is one of the top cheap beginner stocks to watch. On February 6, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced that it intends to initiate a substantial expansion over the next three years, involving the commencement of 500 new branches, renovation of 1,700 locations, and the hiring of 3,500 staff members. The expansion will focus on reaching low-income and rural communities in new markets. Upon completion, this initiative will result in over 1,100 added branches and more than 10,500 new hires in its Consumer Bank team since 2018. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 109 hedge funds were long JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), compared to 106 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 11.3 million shares worth $1.65 billion. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We updated the sustainable scorecard for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). JP Morgan continues to have an Average rating across Governance, Social and Environmental factors. JP Morgan is using its business to improve climate change. JP Morgan has targeted $2.5 trillion in financing between 2021 and 2030 to advance long-term solutions to address climate change and sustainable development. The Board has oversight of corporate responsibility and ESG matters, but ESG and Sustainability are addressed across the firm. JPM does listen to shareholders. After a 31% For Vote on executive compensation in 2022, the Board will not be granting any special awards to Jamie Dimon or Daniel Pinto and if awarded to other Named Executive Officers, there will be a direct performance condition associated with the award. The Compensation Committee limited the cash percentage of Dimon and Pinto’s compensation.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Quarterly Revenue Growth: 10.20%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, and other products for data centers, gaming, and embedded applications. It is one of the best cheap beginner stocks to invest in. On February 1, Citi analyst Christopher Danely observed that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, anticipating $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi suggested that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) may intentionally be underestimating, and the company's CEO expressed confidence in surpassing the $3.5 billion figure for this year. The analyst estimated that AMD could generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from its MI300, according to buy-side investors' expectations.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion. White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.60%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), a diversified software company, operates globally through three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. The Digital Media segment offers products and services for content creation and promotion, including the flagship product Creative Cloud. The Digital Experience segment provides a platform for brands and businesses to manage and optimize customer experiences. The Publishing and Advertising segment offers various products and services, such as e-learning solutions and Advertising Cloud offerings. On December 13, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $4.27 and a revenue of $5.05 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.13 and $30 million, respectively. The company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares during the fourth quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.30%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a global provider of customer relationship management technology, facilitating the connection between companies and customers. The company's services include sales tools for data management, lead monitoring, progress tracking, and analytics. Salesforce also offers a platform allowing businesses to build custom apps, an online learning platform, and Slack for collaboration. On January 30, BofA designated Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) as one of their top picks for 2024. According to BofA Analyst Brad Sills, Salesforce is strategically positioned to further gain market share in the cumulative $200 billion market. Sills highlighted Salesforce's competitive advantage with a significant market share of only 15% and a robust moat derived from its extensive installed base of over 150,000 customers in the core sales/front office category.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 122 hedge funds were bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), same as the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with roughly 15 million shares worth $4 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) ranks 6th on our list of the top cheap stocks for beginners in 2024. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth.

Do Not Fight this Market: 3 Top Ranked Stock to Join the Rally`After such a strong finish in 2023 and follow through at the start of 2024, investors are wondering when the correction is coming. While it is natural to expect some sort of pull-back I think investors would be best off not trying to predict, and instead continue buying top-ranked stocks.Below we can see the Nasdaq 100 is breaking out of this bullish looking consolidation, and the S&P 500 is very nearly pushing through the 5,000 level.Image Source: TradingViewFurthermore, there are many powerful investment themes keeping the markets bid, including a robust economy, exciting technological developments, and tremendous government spending deficits. That last item is definitely worth considering when wondering when the economy is going to slowdown.Because of the massive spending behind the most recent infrastructure bill, where more than $1 trillion is going to be spent, many laid off workers are likely to be soaked up by the public sector, and spending to continue.Based on these influential economic developments, investors should focus on continuing to buy leading stocks with top Zacks ranks, because a major economic slowdown is becoming less and less likely.Here I will share three stocks with top Zacks ranks, and market beating performance over the last month. I particularly like to look for stocks showing relative strength while the market continues to grind higher.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMercadoLibreMercadoLibre MELI, is the Latin-American version of Amazon, building an e-commerce platform that continues to boom in popularity. MercadoLibre has been one of the most exciting stocks in the last few years and its returns continue to delight investors willing to own shares.In addition to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, the company is forecasting impressive growth in sales and earnings.This year, sales are expected to climb 36% YoY to $14.3 billion, while EPS are set to expand 134% to $22.30 per share. That growth is projected to continue on to the next year as well, with sales expected to grow 22.3% the following year, and EPS to increase 57.6%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to the fundamental developments in MercadoLibre, its technical advances are compelling as well. In addition to relative strength against the market, it has been forming a very nice technical trade pattern to measure a breakout trade from.For investors waiting for a technical signal to enter MELI, a move above $1764 would market a clean breakout from this bullish consolidation.Image Source: TradingViewStoneCoStoneCo STNE is a Brazilian financial technology company specializing in payment processing solutions. Founded in 2012, StoneCo provides a range of services, including electronic payments, credit card processing, and point-of-sale technology for businesses of varying sizes.StoneCo has seen earnings estimates steadily trend higher over the last 10 months, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Additionally, the company is entering a period where EPS are expected to expand significantly. Earnings are forecast to grow 167% YoY this year, and 36.1% next year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MercadoLibre, StoneCo stock is forming a convincing technical pattern. STNE stock was hit hard at the end of 2022 and traded sideways at a depressed level for nearly two years.However, at the end of 2023, the stock initiated a stage one breakout, indicating investors had been buying the depressed stock. Now over the last two months, STNE price action has built out a weekly bull flag, leading me to believe another big breakout is coming.If STNE stock trades above the $18.50 level, investors could rush in to buy the stock sending it significantly higher.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon.comFinally, one of the world's leading companies, Amazon AMZN just reported an incredibly strong quarter of financials sending the stock much higher.Following the earnings gap up, Amazon stock is forming a post earnings consolidation, a very high probability trading setup. Above $171 and AMZN should make a run at its all-time high.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon has also been garnering interest from analysts, who have been steadily upgrading earnings estimates. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 22% and current quarter earnings by 12.5%.Earnings at the e-commerce and technology giant are expected to grow by an impressive 28.1% annually over the next 3-5 years, driven by its AWS and new advertising business segments.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe great thing about investing in stocks is that the best ones offer tremendous asymmetric opportunities. There is no reason to try and predict market selloffs, because so long as you focus on buying top-tier securities, the returns take care of themselves. That is not to say that risk management isn’t key, but good investors are often optimists. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Down 61% in the Past Year, Has This E-Commerce Stock Entered Bargain Territory?`The last 12 months were a good period in general for e-commerce stocks. Companies like Amazon, Shopify, MercadoLibre, and Pinduoduo saw their share prices rise at least 30%.But the industry had its laggards too, including JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), which saw its shares fall 61% in the past year. With the stock now down 78% from its all-time high, JD.com has attracted some investors looking to take advantage of a potential bargain.But before you rush into the stock, you should understand how JD.com got here in the first place. Only then can you make an informed investment decision.JD.com is one of the more successful companies replicating Amazon's playbook.The e-commerce giant operates a first-party e-commerce business in China by selling a wide range of products directly to customers. It also operates a third-party marketplace that allows other sellers on its platform, in exchange for fees from each successful transaction.The company emphasizes low prices to encourage customers to buy more over time, and it operates a complex logistics service to offer speedy deliveries. The low prices and fast delivery leads to strong customer retention and sales growth, providing JD.com with the scale needed to drive prices even lower and continuously improve its service.Customers love the approach, which explains the company's uninterrupted growth for many years. For perspective, revenue grew revenue at a compound annual rate of 27% from 2017 to 2021. Everything seemed to be moving in the right direction until recently.Investors accustomed to such an impressive track record were disappointed when the e-commerce company reported just 10% revenue growth in 2022. Subsequent months were even more challenging for the company with revenue growth declining to just 2% in Q3 2023. Revenue from its flagship first-party e-commerce business actually fell 1% year over year, masked by a 13% increase in service revenue.To add salt to the wound, competitor PDD Holdings reported 94% top-line growth in the same quarter. Even Alibaba, which is facing its own challenges, reported 9% growth.JD.com is failing to keep up with the competition. It didn't help that previous CEO Xu Lei stepped down from his post in May 2023 after just one year, adding another layer of uncertainty to the company's future.The silver lining here is the fact the company is still profitable with a strong balance sheet. JD.com generated 39 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in free cash flow in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2023. It also had 242 billion yuan ($33.2 billion) in cash and short-term investments. With this solid financial position, JD.com can continue to invest in areas like live-streaming shopping, supply chain improvements, and other initiatives.Still, investors should be aware the path ahead remains challenging as it will have to outmaneuver rivals like Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and Douyin.So JD.com is at a crossroads. Despite its previous success, the future is far less certain now that it faces a more competitive industry and greater regulatory scrutiny.Given the recent bearish sentiment, JD.com stock trades at a significant discount to other e-commerce companies with a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is just 10.2, while Pinduoduo trades at 27.8 times earnings.Investors should monitor JD.com's rebound efforts in the coming quarters for clues of its progress. If the company can defend its position as a top three e-commerce platform in China and rekindle growth, its current stock price should prove to be a bargain.Should you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?Before you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JD.com wasn’t one of them.

3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now`"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is off to a great start in 2024. The e-commerce giant is making progress along all fronts of its multifaceted business, and its stock is up 66% over the past year.You might not realize that it's still trading below all-time highs. But the way things are going, Amazon stock is likely to surpass that in the coming months, and now is a great time to buy it.Here are three specific reasons to be confident about Amazon stock this year.Amazon made a strategic decision last year to restructure its distribution network from a national one to a regional one. The rationale was that the national network was large and cumbersome, making it take longer, on average, to get products to customers. A regional network stocked with high-selling items would get products to customers faster and at a lower cost.It now has eight regional distribution centers, and the results speak for themselves. In the 2023 fourth quarter, Amazon delivered 65% more items overnight than in the prior year. CEO Andy Jassy noted that as Amazon fulfills orders faster, customers choose it for more orders.In a first since 2018, Amazon has decreased its per-unit cost to fulfill globally, and in the U.S., fulfillment cost per unit decreased by more than $0.45 from last year. This allows Amazon to expand its selection profitably at lower average selling prices, improving its chances of gaining market share.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud services arm. Until recently, AWS sales were reliable to grow at rates around 35% in a typical quarter. That began to drop when inflation became severe, and client businesses started to cut their budgets.However, Amazon continues to lead the industry with 32% of the overall market according to Statista, and sales growth improved in the fourth quarter to 13% year over year. Jassy said the company is seeing larger deals accelerate; it announced several new deals with companies like Salesforce, BMW, and Nvidia.The company launched a robust suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services for AWS, and adoption rates are strong. The company offers three layers of AI to meet the varied needs of its clients, from the most customizable to partially customizable, with the top layer being a generative AI ""coded companion."" Last week, Amazon launched Rufus, a personal shopping generative AI application that takes customer queries and offers product recommendations based on requirements.Jassy said Amazon will continue to invest heavily in AI since it offers the opportunity to revolutionize the shopping and processing experience for its customers, and it sees this as a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years.Amazon only started to break out advertising as its own business segment in late 2021, when it grew 32% year over year, trailing AWS at 40%. With the other businesses slowing down, advertising has become the fastest-growing reporting segment, increasing 26% over last year in the 2023 fourth quarter. That was driven by sponsored ads.Advertising is a no-brainer for Amazon third-party sellers since it exposes them to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers. Amazon's top AI helps them target potential buyers with high accuracy.Amazon recently changed its streaming program to an ad-supported track, like Netflix and Walt Disney, which should pump up this segment even more. This will likely remain a strong business for Amazon in the near term, and as advertisers revisit their budgets after inflation-induced cuts, they're liable to spend more. Some percentage of that will go to Amazon.These are only part of the story. Amazon is making strides in smaller endeavors like cashierless stores, healthcare, and more. 2024 could be a banner year for Amazon, and in the long term, it's likely to add value to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks`"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 5 Stocks.Jim Cramer said in a latest program that after listening to the Fed chair Jerome Powell he believes we are at ""crossroads"" since there is still ""some inflation"" and the ""dichotomy"" of hard landing versus soft landing is being ""replaced by no landing."" Cramer said that we are ""back to reality"" and the reality, according to Cramer, is that interest rates are still ""not that high."" Cramer believes the rates are at a level where the economy can keep working. Cramer wondered how and why the Fed would cut interest rates when strong employment numbers keep coming and inflation is also not going down significantly.Jim Cramer tried to convince his viewers to invest in the stock market and said that while it would seem ""reckless"" to invest in the stock market because of the risks involved, it would be ""too late"" to invest in stocks once the Fed begins to cut interest rates. Jim Cramer said that stocks are in a win-win situation. If the economy keeps growing and the market remains strong, stocks will go up. If the economy begins to slow down, the Fed would cut rates sometime in the future, causing a rally in the stock market. Jim Cramer, however, acknowledged that stocks are risky when compared to the steady 5% income on CDs.Cramer said ""great"" stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can give you that ""5% from CDs"" in ""a week or even a day.""Cramer said that he has ""no illusions"" and he is convinced that now is the right time to buy stocks. Cramer said he thinks many investors would be inclined towards investing in low-risk index funds or parking their cash in CDs or treasuries but he thinks big money will be made by investing in individual stocks.But Jim Cramer is not bullish on all stocks. In fact over the past couple of years or so he's become quite selective in his choices and keeps recommending investors to sell or stay away from low-quality, money-losing or risky stocks and instead buy best of breed and high quality stocks.In this article we will talk about some stocks Cramer is bearish on.MethodologyFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to either stay away from or sell. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment where available. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/ASports and outdoor equipment company Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) recently went public in an IPO that fell short of expectations. Cramer had advised investors to stay away from the stock. He said:“So far, this is looking like another out of favor IPO, even if its lowball price allowed the stock to get a like, I guess you could call it a decent pop. And, I’ve got to tell you, Amer Sports is a great example of the kind of deals I wish we weren’t seeing.”One of the reasons why Cramer is bearish on Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) is the company's high exposure to China.While Cramer is bearish on the stock, Canadian billionaire Chip Wilson, who also founded Lululemon Athletica, bought $324 million worth of shares at the company’s IPO.While Cramer is bearish on companies like Amer Sports, he's recommending buying high-quality mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 9Last month, Jim Cramer was asked about Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC). Cramer recommended the questioner to ""take a pass"" on the stock. Cramer said the ""greatest inventor of our time"" Elon Musk does not like lithium companies and he is trying to figure out a way to cut our dependence on them. Cramer said he would not go against Musk.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Surgical facilities company Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on these days. When asked about Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) in a recent program on CNBC, Cramer said ""that industry is in up and down right now.""""I'm taking a hard pass,"" Cramer said of Surgery Partners.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The biggest stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is owned by Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $157 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22Jim Cramer in a recent program said he hasn’t ""liked Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) in 20 years, and it’s really rewarded my dislike.""Cramer said instead of Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) he's ""willing"" to recommend Verizon.Insider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 22 hedge funds had stakes in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD). The biggest stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) is owned by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP which owns a $37 million stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24Gene editing platform company CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) ranks sixth in our list of stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from.While Cramer said that he ""likes"" CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), the reason why he cannot recommend the stock is that CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) has been losing a lot of money. Cramer said he cannot recommend CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) stock on a ""fundamental basis.""The stock has gained about 17% over the past one year. Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) said the US FDA approved its groundbreaking gene editing therapy, Casgevy, developed with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) for those aged 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT).Unlike Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Cramer likes a lot, the CNBC host is bearish on CRSP.

3 Inspiring Underdogs That Fought Tech Giants and Won`"When it comes to success in emerging industries, size usually matters. Pioneers often fail, leaving behind the foundation for larger players to dominate. Thankfully for investors in mold-breaking upstarts, it doesn't always play out that way.Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Sonos (NASDAQ: SONO), and Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) are three companies that saw Apple and other consumer tech behemoths try to take them out. The little guys are not just surviving, but thriving against established titans with almost limitless resources. Take a bow Roku, Sonos, and Spotify.Roku founder Anthony Wood invented the digital video recorder, but it was another company that enjoyed the DVR glory. He got it right when he launched Roku a few years later, pioneering the streaming video revolution. It wasn't long before Roku was joined by some of the most valuable companies on the planet. Apple TV, Alphabet's Google Chromecast, and Amazon's Fire TV hit the market. Roku didn't flinch.Roku remains the leading operating system for smart TVs in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It has roughly double the market share of its closest rival. It doesn't matter that Google and Amazon are willing to practically give away the hardware to get folks connected. Roku has been able to sacrifice product margins, knowing it can make it up in volume.Roku is free to use, making the lion's share of its revenue from ad sharing and referrals. It's working. Average revenue per user is more than $41 over the past year. There are 75.8 million active accounts on the platform, and boy are they active. Roku users are spending an average of 3.8 hours a day streaming through the Roku hub.It doesn't seem possible. Roku is competing against Apple, a company that is used to getting people to pay a premium for its wares. Alphabet is the global leader in online advertising, putting it in the perfect position to cash in on an ad-supported industry. Amazon is the top dog in online retail, and it aggressively promotes its Fire TV dongles and smart TVs on its platform. Roku is still beating them all.Roku's enemies are also rivals of Sonos. It was 2005 when Sonos rolled out the first wireless multiroom speaker system, which streams audio seamlessly through a home. Audiophiles flocked to Sonos, but then familiar foes emerged. Apple, Amazon, and Google all had cheap smart speakers in support of their virtual assistant technologies. Sonos was in their crosshairs if they chose to go upmarket, but they missed.Sonos would go on to deliver 17 consecutive years of revenue growth before proving mortal in fiscal 2023. On Tuesday afternoon it posted financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. It was a well-received report.Revenue declined 9%, or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. It's not pretty, but analysts were bracing for a 13% decline. The bigger surprise is at the other end of the income statement. Profitability improved at Sonos, earning $0.64 a share for the seasonally potent holiday quarter, up from $0.57 a share a year earlier. Wall Street pros were settling for a sharp decline to $0.39 a share.""Despite the challenging environment, we are winning in the market and outperforming the competition,"" CEO Patrick Spence said in this week's earnings report.Rich in cash and patents, Sonos is well positioned to continue dominating its high-end niche. With analyst profit targets now likely headed higher, Sonos is cheap.Remember when everyone figured that Spotify was toast? The Swedish audio streaming service was making waves worldwide, but would it be able to succeed in the U.S. as Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Amazon Music flooded the market? It's doing pretty well, even if it had to go through three rounds of layoffs last year.There are 602 million mostly ad-supported monthly active users, a 23% increase over the past year. Getting folks to pay is the more difficult nut to crack, but Spotify has been beefing up its catalog of original content to go with its industry-leading music platform. Premium Spotify accounts have risen 15% over the past year to reach 236 million.Apple and Amazon are distant competitors. Google Play Music threw in the towel, handing its digital ambitions over to YouTube Music. It's going to be hard for the other streaming service stocks to catch up to Spotify now.Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners. Global stocks reached their highest point in over two years, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record high on February 7, as per Reuters. This was driven by robust earnings, which helped counter concerns surrounding US regional banks and the Chinese markets. Bonds experienced slight pressure, as statements from Federal Reserve officials reinforced the expectation that the central bank might not reduce interest rates in the near future. According to Arthur Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth: ""We are at the midpoint of the 4Q earnings reporting season, and we would say that there has been more good news than bad.""In 2023, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 26.29%, recovering from the setback of 18.11% in 2022. In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts. The potential combination of declining interest rates and earnings growth is seen as a positive for stocks. However, analysts express worries about overvalued technology sector stocks, and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to introduce significant market volatility.Looking at historical data from 1921 to 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research, noted that the average S&P 500 bull market has yielded a return of 157% and lasted over four years. This historical pattern suggests the possibility of the stock market rally continuing in the foreseeable future. One notable success in the current bull market has been the performance of artificial intelligence technology as an investment theme. AI stocks were among the top performers in 2023, contributing to the market's overall positive trajectory. James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, commented: “The market’s recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI.” On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee suggests a more cautious outlook for 2024, anticipating an average year for markets rather than double-digit gains. Concerns include the S&P 500's elevated forward price/earnings ratio and a historically low equity risk premium. Valuations indicate potential sub-par annual stock returns, with estimates pointing to a 4% gain compared to the long-run average of 7%-8%. Analysts' optimistic projections for 2024 U.S. corporate earnings are questioned, with expectations of a tapering in economic growth from 7% to 4%. The market's assumption of a more aggressive Fed rate-cutting stance contrasts with public signals, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions as emergency programs wind down in 2024.Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, remarked: “As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.” Some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology For this list, we used a stock screener and selected stable companies with high single digit or low-teens revenue growth. Then, we arranged them via market cap to get the largest companies. We selected the top stocks for beginners based on revenue growth and hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter of 2023. The list is sorted in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders. Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Quarterly Revenue Growth: 14.10%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company in the United States with four segments – UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. UnitedHealthcare offers health benefit plans for employers and individuals, Medicaid plans, and children's health insurance.On January 12, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $6.16 and a revenue of $94.4 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.17 and $2.22 billion, respectively. Revenue for the period increased 14% on a year-over-year basis. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 104 hedge funds held stakes worth nearly $11 billion in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared to 111 funds in the prior quarter worth $10.1 billion. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.2 million shares worth $1.6 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best cheap stocks for beginners. Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) contributed less to portfolio performance than the majority of our holdings during the quarter. The Company reported double-digit revenue, operating earnings and earnings per share growth during their third quarter. The Company has been able to adjust pricing in its health care segment to keep up with medical cost inflation while working with its Optum units to deliver more value-based care that replaces the traditional fee for service health care model. Value-based care is a sensible, long-term growth opportunity for the Company to pursue and also differentiates it from the vast majority of healthcare providers, particularly as it relates to Medicare patients. For example, the Company’s value-based care programs provide more preventative care opportunities and home-based care visits for patients which helps save the U.S. healthcare system billions in unnecessary spending while also providing patients with better outcomes, as diseases and behaviors are caught or corrected at earlier stages. The Company has invested in several core assets over many years to execute this value-based strategy and it will become the standard of care as the proportion of people in the U.S. with healthcare insurance coverage continues to reach new highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.00%JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a global financial services company operating in four segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management. It is one of the top cheap beginner stocks to watch. On February 6, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced that it intends to initiate a substantial expansion over the next three years, involving the commencement of 500 new branches, renovation of 1,700 locations, and the hiring of 3,500 staff members. The expansion will focus on reaching low-income and rural communities in new markets. Upon completion, this initiative will result in over 1,100 added branches and more than 10,500 new hires in its Consumer Bank team since 2018. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 109 hedge funds were long JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), compared to 106 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 11.3 million shares worth $1.65 billion. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We updated the sustainable scorecard for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). JP Morgan continues to have an Average rating across Governance, Social and Environmental factors. JP Morgan is using its business to improve climate change. JP Morgan has targeted $2.5 trillion in financing between 2021 and 2030 to advance long-term solutions to address climate change and sustainable development. The Board has oversight of corporate responsibility and ESG matters, but ESG and Sustainability are addressed across the firm. JPM does listen to shareholders. After a 31% For Vote on executive compensation in 2022, the Board will not be granting any special awards to Jamie Dimon or Daniel Pinto and if awarded to other Named Executive Officers, there will be a direct performance condition associated with the award. The Compensation Committee limited the cash percentage of Dimon and Pinto’s compensation.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Quarterly Revenue Growth: 10.20%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, and other products for data centers, gaming, and embedded applications. It is one of the best cheap beginner stocks to invest in. On February 1, Citi analyst Christopher Danely observed that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, anticipating $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi suggested that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) may intentionally be underestimating, and the company's CEO expressed confidence in surpassing the $3.5 billion figure for this year. The analyst estimated that AMD could generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from its MI300, according to buy-side investors' expectations.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion. White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.60%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), a diversified software company, operates globally through three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. The Digital Media segment offers products and services for content creation and promotion, including the flagship product Creative Cloud. The Digital Experience segment provides a platform for brands and businesses to manage and optimize customer experiences. The Publishing and Advertising segment offers various products and services, such as e-learning solutions and Advertising Cloud offerings. On December 13, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $4.27 and a revenue of $5.05 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.13 and $30 million, respectively. The company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares during the fourth quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.30%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a global provider of customer relationship management technology, facilitating the connection between companies and customers. The company's services include sales tools for data management, lead monitoring, progress tracking, and analytics. Salesforce also offers a platform allowing businesses to build custom apps, an online learning platform, and Slack for collaboration. On January 30, BofA designated Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) as one of their top picks for 2024. According to BofA Analyst Brad Sills, Salesforce is strategically positioned to further gain market share in the cumulative $200 billion market. Sills highlighted Salesforce's competitive advantage with a significant market share of only 15% and a robust moat derived from its extensive installed base of over 150,000 customers in the core sales/front office category.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 122 hedge funds were bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), same as the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with roughly 15 million shares worth $4 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) ranks 6th on our list of the top cheap stocks for beginners in 2024. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners.  Suggested articles:Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks15 Best Bitcoin Wallets For iPhone and Android11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:57:36.878120`AMZN
Do Not Fight this Market: 3 Top Ranked Stock to Join the Rally`After such a strong finish in 2023 and follow through at the start of 2024, investors are wondering when the correction is coming. While it is natural to expect some sort of pull-back I think investors would be best off not trying to predict, and instead continue buying top-ranked stocks.Below we can see the Nasdaq 100 is breaking out of this bullish looking consolidation, and the S&P 500 is very nearly pushing through the 5,000 level.Image Source: TradingViewFurthermore, there are many powerful investment themes keeping the markets bid, including a robust economy, exciting technological developments, and tremendous government spending deficits. That last item is definitely worth considering when wondering when the economy is going to slowdown.Because of the massive spending behind the most recent infrastructure bill, where more than $1 trillion is going to be spent, many laid off workers are likely to be soaked up by the public sector, and spending to continue.Based on these influential economic developments, investors should focus on continuing to buy leading stocks with top Zacks ranks, because a major economic slowdown is becoming less and less likely.Here I will share three stocks with top Zacks ranks, and market beating performance over the last month. I particularly like to look for stocks showing relative strength while the market continues to grind higher.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMercadoLibreMercadoLibre MELI, is the Latin-American version of Amazon, building an e-commerce platform that continues to boom in popularity. MercadoLibre has been one of the most exciting stocks in the last few years and its returns continue to delight investors willing to own shares.In addition to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, the company is forecasting impressive growth in sales and earnings.This year, sales are expected to climb 36% YoY to $14.3 billion, while EPS are set to expand 134% to $22.30 per share. That growth is projected to continue on to the next year as well, with sales expected to grow 22.3% the following year, and EPS to increase 57.6%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to the fundamental developments in MercadoLibre, its technical advances are compelling as well. In addition to relative strength against the market, it has been forming a very nice technical trade pattern to measure a breakout trade from.For investors waiting for a technical signal to enter MELI, a move above $1764 would market a clean breakout from this bullish consolidation.Image Source: TradingViewStoneCoStoneCo STNE is a Brazilian financial technology company specializing in payment processing solutions. Founded in 2012, StoneCo provides a range of services, including electronic payments, credit card processing, and point-of-sale technology for businesses of varying sizes.StoneCo has seen earnings estimates steadily trend higher over the last 10 months, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Additionally, the company is entering a period where EPS are expected to expand significantly. Earnings are forecast to grow 167% YoY this year, and 36.1% next year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MercadoLibre, StoneCo stock is forming a convincing technical pattern. STNE stock was hit hard at the end of 2022 and traded sideways at a depressed level for nearly two years.However, at the end of 2023, the stock initiated a stage one breakout, indicating investors had been buying the depressed stock. Now over the last two months, STNE price action has built out a weekly bull flag, leading me to believe another big breakout is coming.If STNE stock trades above the $18.50 level, investors could rush in to buy the stock sending it significantly higher.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon.comFinally, one of the world's leading companies, Amazon AMZN just reported an incredibly strong quarter of financials sending the stock much higher.Following the earnings gap up, Amazon stock is forming a post earnings consolidation, a very high probability trading setup. Above $171 and AMZN should make a run at its all-time high.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon has also been garnering interest from analysts, who have been steadily upgrading earnings estimates. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 22% and current quarter earnings by 12.5%.Earnings at the e-commerce and technology giant are expected to grow by an impressive 28.1% annually over the next 3-5 years, driven by its AWS and new advertising business segments.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe great thing about investing in stocks is that the best ones offer tremendous asymmetric opportunities. There is no reason to try and predict market selloffs, because so long as you focus on buying top-tier securities, the returns take care of themselves. That is not to say that risk management isn’t key, but good investors are often optimists. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Down 61% in the Past Year, Has This E-Commerce Stock Entered Bargain Territory?`The last 12 months were a good period in general for e-commerce stocks. Companies like Amazon, Shopify, MercadoLibre, and Pinduoduo saw their share prices rise at least 30%.But the industry had its laggards too, including JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), which saw its shares fall 61% in the past year. With the stock now down 78% from its all-time high, JD.com has attracted some investors looking to take advantage of a potential bargain.But before you rush into the stock, you should understand how JD.com got here in the first place. Only then can you make an informed investment decision.JD.com is one of the more successful companies replicating Amazon's playbook.The e-commerce giant operates a first-party e-commerce business in China by selling a wide range of products directly to customers. It also operates a third-party marketplace that allows other sellers on its platform, in exchange for fees from each successful transaction.The company emphasizes low prices to encourage customers to buy more over time, and it operates a complex logistics service to offer speedy deliveries. The low prices and fast delivery leads to strong customer retention and sales growth, providing JD.com with the scale needed to drive prices even lower and continuously improve its service.Customers love the approach, which explains the company's uninterrupted growth for many years. For perspective, revenue grew revenue at a compound annual rate of 27% from 2017 to 2021. Everything seemed to be moving in the right direction until recently.Investors accustomed to such an impressive track record were disappointed when the e-commerce company reported just 10% revenue growth in 2022. Subsequent months were even more challenging for the company with revenue growth declining to just 2% in Q3 2023. Revenue from its flagship first-party e-commerce business actually fell 1% year over year, masked by a 13% increase in service revenue.To add salt to the wound, competitor PDD Holdings reported 94% top-line growth in the same quarter. Even Alibaba, which is facing its own challenges, reported 9% growth.JD.com is failing to keep up with the competition. It didn't help that previous CEO Xu Lei stepped down from his post in May 2023 after just one year, adding another layer of uncertainty to the company's future.The silver lining here is the fact the company is still profitable with a strong balance sheet. JD.com generated 39 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in free cash flow in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2023. It also had 242 billion yuan ($33.2 billion) in cash and short-term investments. With this solid financial position, JD.com can continue to invest in areas like live-streaming shopping, supply chain improvements, and other initiatives.Still, investors should be aware the path ahead remains challenging as it will have to outmaneuver rivals like Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and Douyin.So JD.com is at a crossroads. Despite its previous success, the future is far less certain now that it faces a more competitive industry and greater regulatory scrutiny.Given the recent bearish sentiment, JD.com stock trades at a significant discount to other e-commerce companies with a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is just 10.2, while Pinduoduo trades at 27.8 times earnings.Investors should monitor JD.com's rebound efforts in the coming quarters for clues of its progress. If the company can defend its position as a top three e-commerce platform in China and rekindle growth, its current stock price should prove to be a bargain.Should you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?Before you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JD.com wasn’t one of them.

3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now`"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is off to a great start in 2024. The e-commerce giant is making progress along all fronts of its multifaceted business, and its stock is up 66% over the past year.You might not realize that it's still trading below all-time highs. But the way things are going, Amazon stock is likely to surpass that in the coming months, and now is a great time to buy it.Here are three specific reasons to be confident about Amazon stock this year.Amazon made a strategic decision last year to restructure its distribution network from a national one to a regional one. The rationale was that the national network was large and cumbersome, making it take longer, on average, to get products to customers. A regional network stocked with high-selling items would get products to customers faster and at a lower cost.It now has eight regional distribution centers, and the results speak for themselves. In the 2023 fourth quarter, Amazon delivered 65% more items overnight than in the prior year. CEO Andy Jassy noted that as Amazon fulfills orders faster, customers choose it for more orders.In a first since 2018, Amazon has decreased its per-unit cost to fulfill globally, and in the U.S., fulfillment cost per unit decreased by more than $0.45 from last year. This allows Amazon to expand its selection profitably at lower average selling prices, improving its chances of gaining market share.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud services arm. Until recently, AWS sales were reliable to grow at rates around 35% in a typical quarter. That began to drop when inflation became severe, and client businesses started to cut their budgets.However, Amazon continues to lead the industry with 32% of the overall market according to Statista, and sales growth improved in the fourth quarter to 13% year over year. Jassy said the company is seeing larger deals accelerate; it announced several new deals with companies like Salesforce, BMW, and Nvidia.The company launched a robust suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services for AWS, and adoption rates are strong. The company offers three layers of AI to meet the varied needs of its clients, from the most customizable to partially customizable, with the top layer being a generative AI ""coded companion."" Last week, Amazon launched Rufus, a personal shopping generative AI application that takes customer queries and offers product recommendations based on requirements.Jassy said Amazon will continue to invest heavily in AI since it offers the opportunity to revolutionize the shopping and processing experience for its customers, and it sees this as a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years.Amazon only started to break out advertising as its own business segment in late 2021, when it grew 32% year over year, trailing AWS at 40%. With the other businesses slowing down, advertising has become the fastest-growing reporting segment, increasing 26% over last year in the 2023 fourth quarter. That was driven by sponsored ads.Advertising is a no-brainer for Amazon third-party sellers since it exposes them to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers. Amazon's top AI helps them target potential buyers with high accuracy.Amazon recently changed its streaming program to an ad-supported track, like Netflix and Walt Disney, which should pump up this segment even more. This will likely remain a strong business for Amazon in the near term, and as advertisers revisit their budgets after inflation-induced cuts, they're liable to spend more. Some percentage of that will go to Amazon.These are only part of the story. Amazon is making strides in smaller endeavors like cashierless stores, healthcare, and more. 2024 could be a banner year for Amazon, and in the long term, it's likely to add value to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks`"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 5 Stocks.Jim Cramer said in a latest program that after listening to the Fed chair Jerome Powell he believes we are at ""crossroads"" since there is still ""some inflation"" and the ""dichotomy"" of hard landing versus soft landing is being ""replaced by no landing."" Cramer said that we are ""back to reality"" and the reality, according to Cramer, is that interest rates are still ""not that high."" Cramer believes the rates are at a level where the economy can keep working. Cramer wondered how and why the Fed would cut interest rates when strong employment numbers keep coming and inflation is also not going down significantly.Jim Cramer tried to convince his viewers to invest in the stock market and said that while it would seem ""reckless"" to invest in the stock market because of the risks involved, it would be ""too late"" to invest in stocks once the Fed begins to cut interest rates. Jim Cramer said that stocks are in a win-win situation. If the economy keeps growing and the market remains strong, stocks will go up. If the economy begins to slow down, the Fed would cut rates sometime in the future, causing a rally in the stock market. Jim Cramer, however, acknowledged that stocks are risky when compared to the steady 5% income on CDs.Cramer said ""great"" stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can give you that ""5% from CDs"" in ""a week or even a day.""Cramer said that he has ""no illusions"" and he is convinced that now is the right time to buy stocks. Cramer said he thinks many investors would be inclined towards investing in low-risk index funds or parking their cash in CDs or treasuries but he thinks big money will be made by investing in individual stocks.But Jim Cramer is not bullish on all stocks. In fact over the past couple of years or so he's become quite selective in his choices and keeps recommending investors to sell or stay away from low-quality, money-losing or risky stocks and instead buy best of breed and high quality stocks.In this article we will talk about some stocks Cramer is bearish on.MethodologyFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to either stay away from or sell. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment where available. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/ASports and outdoor equipment company Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) recently went public in an IPO that fell short of expectations. Cramer had advised investors to stay away from the stock. He said:“So far, this is looking like another out of favor IPO, even if its lowball price allowed the stock to get a like, I guess you could call it a decent pop. And, I’ve got to tell you, Amer Sports is a great example of the kind of deals I wish we weren’t seeing.”One of the reasons why Cramer is bearish on Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) is the company's high exposure to China.While Cramer is bearish on the stock, Canadian billionaire Chip Wilson, who also founded Lululemon Athletica, bought $324 million worth of shares at the company’s IPO.While Cramer is bearish on companies like Amer Sports, he's recommending buying high-quality mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 9Last month, Jim Cramer was asked about Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC). Cramer recommended the questioner to ""take a pass"" on the stock. Cramer said the ""greatest inventor of our time"" Elon Musk does not like lithium companies and he is trying to figure out a way to cut our dependence on them. Cramer said he would not go against Musk.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Surgical facilities company Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on these days. When asked about Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) in a recent program on CNBC, Cramer said ""that industry is in up and down right now.""""I'm taking a hard pass,"" Cramer said of Surgery Partners.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The biggest stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is owned by Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $157 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22Jim Cramer in a recent program said he hasn’t ""liked Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) in 20 years, and it’s really rewarded my dislike.""Cramer said instead of Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) he's ""willing"" to recommend Verizon.Insider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 22 hedge funds had stakes in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD). The biggest stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) is owned by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP which owns a $37 million stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24Gene editing platform company CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) ranks sixth in our list of stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from.While Cramer said that he ""likes"" CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), the reason why he cannot recommend the stock is that CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) has been losing a lot of money. Cramer said he cannot recommend CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) stock on a ""fundamental basis.""The stock has gained about 17% over the past one year. Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) said the US FDA approved its groundbreaking gene editing therapy, Casgevy, developed with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) for those aged 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT).Unlike Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Cramer likes a lot, the CNBC host is bearish on CRSP.

3 Inspiring Underdogs That Fought Tech Giants and Won`"When it comes to success in emerging industries, size usually matters. Pioneers often fail, leaving behind the foundation for larger players to dominate. Thankfully for investors in mold-breaking upstarts, it doesn't always play out that way.Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Sonos (NASDAQ: SONO), and Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) are three companies that saw Apple and other consumer tech behemoths try to take them out. The little guys are not just surviving, but thriving against established titans with almost limitless resources. Take a bow Roku, Sonos, and Spotify.Roku founder Anthony Wood invented the digital video recorder, but it was another company that enjoyed the DVR glory. He got it right when he launched Roku a few years later, pioneering the streaming video revolution. It wasn't long before Roku was joined by some of the most valuable companies on the planet. Apple TV, Alphabet's Google Chromecast, and Amazon's Fire TV hit the market. Roku didn't flinch.Roku remains the leading operating system for smart TVs in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It has roughly double the market share of its closest rival. It doesn't matter that Google and Amazon are willing to practically give away the hardware to get folks connected. Roku has been able to sacrifice product margins, knowing it can make it up in volume.Roku is free to use, making the lion's share of its revenue from ad sharing and referrals. It's working. Average revenue per user is more than $41 over the past year. There are 75.8 million active accounts on the platform, and boy are they active. Roku users are spending an average of 3.8 hours a day streaming through the Roku hub.It doesn't seem possible. Roku is competing against Apple, a company that is used to getting people to pay a premium for its wares. Alphabet is the global leader in online advertising, putting it in the perfect position to cash in on an ad-supported industry. Amazon is the top dog in online retail, and it aggressively promotes its Fire TV dongles and smart TVs on its platform. Roku is still beating them all.Roku's enemies are also rivals of Sonos. It was 2005 when Sonos rolled out the first wireless multiroom speaker system, which streams audio seamlessly through a home. Audiophiles flocked to Sonos, but then familiar foes emerged. Apple, Amazon, and Google all had cheap smart speakers in support of their virtual assistant technologies. Sonos was in their crosshairs if they chose to go upmarket, but they missed.Sonos would go on to deliver 17 consecutive years of revenue growth before proving mortal in fiscal 2023. On Tuesday afternoon it posted financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. It was a well-received report.Revenue declined 9%, or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. It's not pretty, but analysts were bracing for a 13% decline. The bigger surprise is at the other end of the income statement. Profitability improved at Sonos, earning $0.64 a share for the seasonally potent holiday quarter, up from $0.57 a share a year earlier. Wall Street pros were settling for a sharp decline to $0.39 a share.""Despite the challenging environment, we are winning in the market and outperforming the competition,"" CEO Patrick Spence said in this week's earnings report.Rich in cash and patents, Sonos is well positioned to continue dominating its high-end niche. With analyst profit targets now likely headed higher, Sonos is cheap.Remember when everyone figured that Spotify was toast? The Swedish audio streaming service was making waves worldwide, but would it be able to succeed in the U.S. as Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Amazon Music flooded the market? It's doing pretty well, even if it had to go through three rounds of layoffs last year.There are 602 million mostly ad-supported monthly active users, a 23% increase over the past year. Getting folks to pay is the more difficult nut to crack, but Spotify has been beefing up its catalog of original content to go with its industry-leading music platform. Premium Spotify accounts have risen 15% over the past year to reach 236 million.Apple and Amazon are distant competitors. Google Play Music threw in the towel, handing its digital ambitions over to YouTube Music. It's going to be hard for the other streaming service stocks to catch up to Spotify now.Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

How Twitter's descent into chaos is paving the way for a new web`"The post-Twitter era has spurred the development and further growth of numerous social networks that prioritize brief posts, from open source standbys like Mastodon to new decentralized concepts like Bluesky, and those from smaller startups like Post, Spill, and Spoutible, to those from tech giants like Meta, which launched the Twitter-like Threads. While this is great news for people looking for a new place to land after Twitter's demise (the network under Elon Musk is now called X and headed in a different direction), it's a challenge for early adopters who want to experiment with new apps and services.Not everyone is satisfied with X's current course. Though a top-ranked app today, it's not the Twitter of years past. X takes a lax approach to content moderation, leaving advertisers and some users in search of new options. Even its owner dabbles in antisemitism and trolling, prompting more of the same from the user base. As top advertisers fled, X's ads became worse and more spammy.Elon Musk says ‘go f*ck yourself’ to advertisers leaving XThe changes at X have been swift and troublesome, leading to a flurry of activity in the social sphere as X alternatives emerged. But now there's too much of a good thing.The Twitter diaspora, so to speak, is hungry for a solution to save them from having to browse content from across half a dozen apps, in addition to the news websites, blogs, and other information sources they already consume while online.That problem is now being addressed by another group of developers -- those who aren't trying to re-create Twitter or improve upon it, but solve the problem of there being ""too many Twitters"" to keep up with.Last week, we reported on Tapestry, a new project from The Iconfactory, the app development shop best known for its work on the early Twitter client Twitterrific. Recently funded on Kickstarter after only showing off its prototype build, Tapestry aims to offer a unified app for tracking social media, news, and RSS feeds in one place. That includes posts from X, Bluesky, Mastodon, Tumblr, and others in the future, like perhaps Threads.The Iconfactory was only looking to raise $100,000 to start development of the new app. It was fully funded as of February 5 and has since exceeded that, which allows it to now chase stretch goals of $150,000 and up, which would fund additional features for the app, like muting, filtering, search, bookmarking, and more.Image Credits: The IconfactoryThe Iconfactory isn't the only developer who has seized on this moment to develop a new multi-service social app.The developer behind the popular Mac and iOS newsreader app Reeder, Silvio Rizzi, is now working on something of a Reeder replacement. Though Rizzi says Reeder will continue to be supported, the new project aims to offer more than just news feeds. In an announcement on Mastodon last week, the developer teased plans for an app that's ""not just an RSS reader,"" but instead a tool that would allow you to access content from across sources, like ""podcasts, YouTube, Mastodon, and more,"" he said.The app is expected to launch into public beta later this spring on Mac, iPhone, and iPad. (A screenshot of the app concept Rizzi posted offered a nod to Tapestry, as both projects emerged around the same time.)Image Credits: Silvio RizziMeanwhile, Tapbots, the makers of Mastodon client Ivory (and previously the Twitter app Tweetbot on which it's based), is weighing how to approach the growing number of social networks available to users. There is no single Twitter alternative, so deciding where to focus limited developer resources is key.According to Tapbots co-founder Paul Haddad, the company hasn't yet decided whether it will support Bluesky yet, but says they are thinking about it.""We’ve got our next few months pretty booked with Ivory/Mastodon features and of course are committed to the Fediverse long-term,"" he told TechCrunch, referring to the decentralized social web powered by the ActivityPub protocol. ""We do plan to take a look at Bluesky sometime after that.""However, if Tapbots chooses to support Bluesky, it may or may not be part of the Ivory app, he added.Other services are focused on the needs of power users and creators to cross-post to multiple networks at once. This includes scheduling tools like those from fedica and Postpone, as well as consumer apps like Yup. The latter offers a solution for posting to X, Bluesky, Farcaster, Lens, and Threads, though it lacks access to a Threads developer API, requiring users to disable Instagram’s two-factor authentication (2FA) to get it to work. (We do NOT recommend this.)Image Credits: YupSimilarly, an app from a Japanese developer, Sora, offers access to Mastodon, Bluesky, and the federated networks Misskey and Firefish.Then there are the various web3, blockchain-based networks, and protocols, like Farcaster and Lens, as well as other decentralized protocols that are fostering networks of their own, like Nostr (favored by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey these days). There's also the decentralized network Matrix, which offers multiple cross-platform clients.Even Reddit has inspired decentralized alternatives, like Lemmy, /kbin, and other smaller projects.Because not all the decentralized networks talk to each other, bridges between protocols are also being built, like those that connect Matrix to Nostr or Mastodon to Bluesky, among others.Quipped Columbia Journalism Review journalist and longtime tech early adopter Mathew Ingram in a post on Threads, ""We need a FriendFeed for the 2000s.""His reference recalls a former era of social networking plenty, Web 2.0, when users turned to a social networking aggregator co-founded by then-former Googlers Bret Taylor (former Salesforce Co-CEO), Gmail creator Paul Buchheit, Jim Norris, and Sanjeev Singh. FriendFeed brought together social networking websites, bookmarking sites, websites, blogs, and microblogs into one place -- something that's again in demand today following the explosion of Twitter alternatives and decentralized services.Of course, Facebook eventually acquired FriendFeed and began to dominate social media, shutting out even well-resourced competitors like Google+. Now known as Meta, the social networking giant remains unbeaten, with nearly 3.2 billion users across its family of apps. But in its rush to adopt the ActivityPub protocol in its new app Threads, also used by Mastodon, there's a hint of concern. It suggests that even Meta believes the tide could possibly turn against it, as users embrace these alternative social platforms.For some smaller apps, the decision is whether to try to compete with the growing number of alternatives or join them. For instance, the Twitter competitor, Spoutible, founded by Christopher Bouzy, the developer of a Twitter analytics service previously, announced in December that his network would ""soon"" integrate with Mastodon for cross-posting and later, Threads.""Users being able to post across various platforms positions Spoutible not just as a social media platform but as a versatile tool designed to streamline your digital communication,"" he wrote, after it was clear Spoutible was not among those favored to win the competition to be the new Twitter.Unfortunately for people in hopes of a simple cross-posting solution, Spoutible this month faced security issues when it was revealed the API had a serious vulnerability that could allow hackers to take control of user accounts. The API even returned users' 2FA (two-factor authentication) code and the reset tokens that helped users change passwords. That puts Spoutible's cross-posting plans on the back burner for the time being, if not its future altogether.Another Web 2.0 survivor, Flipboard, also recently decided integration was the best path forward. It ditched Twitter and integrated with Mastodon while rebuilding its backend to join the fediverse -- the decentralized social web. The social magazine app also became the first app to support Bluesky, Mastodon, and Pixelfed (a decentralized Instagram alternative) last May, allowing users to track updates across these social networks, as well as YouTube, all in one place.Image Credits: FlipboardAnother platform, micro.blog, is looking to address the cross-posting needs from a different angle: as the blog host. Instead of creating content directly on social platforms, users could publish to micro.blog, follow other bloggers, and engage in conversations, while also still cross-posting to more popular platforms including Mastodon, Medium, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Flickr, Bluesky, Nostr, and Pixelfed. (The Iconfactory said its forthcoming app Tapestry would also support micro.blog).Elsewhere, publishing giant WordPress acquired an ActivityPub plugin to allow WordPress blogs to join the fediverse. Newsletter platform Substack created a short-form ""Notes"" feed that resembled Twitter. Artifact, the aggregator from Instagram's co-founders, eventually pivoted to cloning Twitter before shutting down.In short, a lot is going on in the social web today. And this is by no means a definitive list of those companies and developers attacking the problem -- or adding to it. Unnamed are, of course, the wide variety of open source and smaller projects in the works, too, as is common when open APIs are available.Whether this explosion of new social networks is a temporary problem or a new state of being remains to be seen. Likely, some of the smaller ""Twitter-alts"" will eventually die off, after failing to gain traction, or will fold into the wider fediverse, as the would-be Twitter rival Pebble (formerly T2) did last year.But it's also possible that we're witnessing the rebuilding of the web in real time. One where there are many protocols, many platforms, and many ways to connect not just people, but also their media, and their ideas, along with links to websites, news, and blogs.Aggregators like Tapestry may be an initial step to figuring out how to navigate this new web, but it also calls out for a way to search it too: a new Google of sorts that plugs into all the activity now taking place beyond websites, including the information that's shared through these novel social networks across new protocols. And who is building that?Twitterrific’s team is back with Tapestry, an app for tracking social media, news, RSS and moreAs Bluesky opens to the public, CEO Jay Graber faces her biggest challenge yetThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/07/how-twitters-descent-into-chaos-is-paving-the-way-for-a-new-web/Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:57:49.418121`META
Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Magnificent 7 ETFs Rise on Blockbuster Earnings`"The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Tesla TSLA, now account for almost 30% of the S&P 500 index. They were responsible for more than 62% of the S&P 500’s total return in 2023.Most experts anticipated a broadening of the market rally in 2024; however, market leadership has narrowed further this year. These stocks have driven more than 80% of the index's rise.All these companies benefited from the AI hype in 2023, but we've seen divergent performances in 2024 as investors assess which will emerge as the biggest beneficiaries of the forthcoming AI boom.Nvidia and Meta are leading the group, while Tesla significantly lags. This divergence has expanded in the past few weeks, as all but one reported their financial results. Meta's results were particularly well-received, sending the shares of the social media giant up more than 20%.Tesla has been punished for missing both earnings and revenue estimates. The EV giant’s earnings were down almost 46% amid weakening margins. The stock has lost 26% of its value this year.While NVIDIA is yet to announce its results, its stock has already appreciated by 42% in 2024, following a 240% increase in 2023, as most other giants disclosed aggressive AI investments.The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS provides equal weight exposure to these stocks.

Meta challenges supervisory fee for EU online content rules`"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Meta Platforms has challenged a supervisory fee amounting to 0.05% of its annual worldwide net income aimed at covering EU regulators' costs of monitoring compliance with new European Union rules requiring it to do more to police content.The European Commission has said the Digital Services Act (DSA) levy applies to 20 very large online platforms, including Meta, Google, Apple and TikTok and two very large online search engines.The size of the annual fee is related to the number of average monthly active users for each company and whether it posts a profit or loss in the preceding financial year.Meta said it disagreed with the methodology used to calculate the fees.""Currently, companies that record a loss don't have to pay, even if they have a large user base or represent a greater regulatory burden, which means some companies pay nothing, leaving others to pay a disproportionate amount of the total,"" a Meta spokesperson said.The company has challenged the levy at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest. Politico was the first to report about Meta's move.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by David Gregorio)Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:57:49.418121`META
Meta accused of not taking Facebook Marketplace fraud seriously`Meta has been accused by MPs of not taking the problem of online fraud on its platforms seriously.The parent company of Facebook and Instagram came under scrutiny from the Home Affairs Select Committee after representatives from the banking sector said the “majority” of scams they see start on Meta platforms.Paul Davis, financial crime prevention director at TSB, told the committee that Facebook Marketplace is the “main place” where purchase scams originate, which, along with investment and impersonation scams, are the most common types of fraud affecting bank customers.“For those three types, which as I say are the main ones, we see about 80% start on social media,” Mr Davis told MPs.“Indeed, let’s not walk past the fact that, when I say social media there, the majority of them start from the channels owned by one company in particular, which is Meta.”🗣️We are now live and questioning banks and big tech firms on how they protect people from fraud. We are hearing from:@TSB@RevolutApp@santanderuk@Meta@BTGroup@Microsoft📺Watch here: https://t.co/tzoMPErfmQ pic.twitter.com/W9vtl7DRJe— Home Affairs Committee (@CommonsHomeAffs) February 7, 2024He added: “Facebook Marketplace doesn’t have a payments channel attached to it, it’s not like a website you might use to buy something off a high street shop, for example, or Amazon. So, you have to get bank details from the seller of that item.“What we see are customers telling us that they get bank details from the seller, send them money and then the item never turns up.”In response, Philip Milton, public policy manager for fraud at Meta, told the committee that the tech giant takes the issue “extremely seriously”.When suggested by the committee that evidence given to MPs by the banks shows Meta is not doing all it can to prevent online fraud, Mr Milton said: “I disagree with that.”He went on: “To give you an idea of the scale that we’re putting in place to tackle this kind of thing, since 2016 we’ve invested 20 billion dollars on safety and security, and that’s not slowing down – five billion of that was in the last year alone.“We have 40,000 people working across the company on safety and security. Half of that number are involved in directly reviewing content, so we invest significantly in trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening.”He added that fraud “fundamentally undermines the experience we’re trying to provide for people” and said this, combined with fraudulent advertising affecting trust in the company from advertisers and its wider reputation, means the firm is “directly incentivised” to do all it can to prevent criminal activity.However, committee member Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, argued that the five billion dollars Meta said it spent last year on safety and security equates to less than 4% of the firm’s annual revenue for the year – a figure he suggested is “not very high”.Mr Loughton also questioned whether the 20,000 people reviewing content for Meta is an adequate number given the site has “four billion active accounts”, and suggested the social media giant is not taking the issue “terribly seriously” because, as Facebook Marketplace does not have a payments channel linked to it, the site is not financially liable if fraud takes place there.“You apparently have no financial skin in the game for clamping down on fraud on Facebook Marketplace other than potential reputational damage,” he said.“Unless there’s a clear link with advertisers walking away with their revenue because they’re concerned at (banking sector research showing) 80% of fraud starting on (social media platforms) and 68% of it specifically your platforms, then you don’t really have to take it terribly seriously – and the fact you’re spending five billion dollars out of an annual revenue of 134.9 billion, which, as I say, is three and a bit percent for a people-based service, is tiny.“So you’re not taking this problem seriously, are you?”In response, Mr Milton said: “I don’t agree with that at all”, and argued that “the scale of our investment demonstrates how seriously we take this problem”, adding that it is “market-leading” levels of funding for safety and security.He added that, in response to tactics from fraudsters who demand payment or ask for an item to be sent before it is paid for, Meta has “removed the ability to ship an item on Facebook Marketplace”, and that there is “no way to pay for an item” on the platform because the firm is trying to “design out” the ability for criminals to use the platform for fraud.Related Quotes`2024-02-08 00:57:49.418121`META
Germany forced to slash DHL stake by €2.2bn to fix railways`Germany has been forced to sell off some of its stake in package deliverer DHL as it struggles to improve the country’s rail network amid a budget crisis.The KfW bank, which holds the government’s remaining stakes in previously state-held companies, said it has sold 50 million shares of Deutsche Post, the name under which it still trades on the stock exchange.The €2.2bn (£1.9bn) sale, at €43.45 each, cuts the German state’s share in the company by 4pc to 16.5pc.Germany’s finance ministry said the money would be used to strengthen the capital of Germany’s main railway operator, the state-owned Deutsche Bahn, and to improve railway infrastructure.The government has been forced to turn to share sales to help finance improvements to the rail network after a court ruling forced it to plug a big hole in this year’s budget and reconsider its wider financial plans.In November, Germany’s highest court annulled a decision made by the government in 2022 to repurpose €60bn originally meant to cushion the fallout from the pandemic for measures to help combat climate change and modernise the country.Read the latest updates below.Thanks for joining us today. My colleague Chris Price will be back in the morning, reporting on the latest company news as the London markets open.Brussels has waved through new rules that will force derivative traders to clear deals through the European Union, dealing the latest blow to the City. Our reporter Adam Mawardi has the details:London could lose control of its lucrative clearing market after EU officials backed proposals to shift more business activity to operators across the bloc.The provisional rules require banks and asset managers above a certain threshold to clear derivative contracts, such as euro interest rate swaps, through accounts with EU-based clearing houses.Vincent Van Peteghem, Belgium’s finance minister who helped negotiate the agreement with the European Parliament, said: “This will bring more clearing services to Europe and enhance our strategic autonomy.”Clearing houses serve as middlemen between buyers and sellers for financial assets and ensure deals go through even when counterparties default.They have become a crucial part of the banking system following the 2008 financial crisis which exposed the risks around derivative trading.The controversial change is designed to make EU clearing houses more attractive, effectively ending Europe’s reliance on UK-based rivals following Brexit.Read the full report...The sovereign wealth fund behind McLaren is seeking to bring in new investors to help fund the British carmaker’s growth, according to a report.McLaren’s controlling shareholder, Mumtalakat of Bahrain, is looking to raise additional investment to develop McLaren’s technology and enter new markets.

We’re just not sure yet whether it will affect our deliveries between now and the end of June.Boeing told The Telegraph:Ryanair is a valued customer and we are working closely with them to address their concerns. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to improve our quality and delivery performance and will support our customers every step of the way.Rishi Sunak must slash Britain’s benefits bill instead of relying on immigration if he wants to get the country’s debts under control, according to an official at the UK’s budget watchdog. Szu Ping Chan reports:Rishi Sunak must slash Britain’s benefits bill instead of relying on immigration if he wants to get the country’s debts under control, according to an official at the UK’s budget watchdog.David Miles, an executive member of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said waves of new migrants would not solve Britain’s fiscal crisis and were likely to add to pressure on public services.The former Bank of England rate-setter added that a migrant-driven upgrade to the UK’s population projections may not provide a long-term boost to the public finances. It came as analysis by Bloomberg suggested that rising migrant numbers could hand Jeremy Hunt £18bn for tax cuts next month by boosting the economy.Writing for the Telegraph, Mr Miles described welfare reforms that encouraged more people back to work as “unambiguously beneficial” for tax revenues, adding that a drive to get increase employment was “particularly great” for younger people suffering from mental health issues.By contrast, the Imperial College professor said it was “much less clear that persistently high levels of net immigration to boost the labour force can generate sustained fiscal improvements”, suggesting that relying on public investment or a sharp rise in productivity were also unlikely to bear fruit.Read the full report...Luxury online store Farfetch has been dealt a fresh blow as the owner of Bergdorf Goodman moved to end a partnership deal struck two years ago.The Telegraph understands that Neiman Marcus Group is pulling a tie-up with the British fashion retailer, which last month collapsed and was rescued by South Korea’s Coupang.Under the deal which was agreed in early 2022, Farfetch and Neiman Marcus had been working on improving the Bergdorf Goodman website and mobile app. Bergdorf Goodman is a well-known luxury US department store which has featured in shows including Gossip Girl.Farfetch also agreed to take a minority stake in Neiman Marcus under the 2022 agreement, investing $200m (£158m) into the business. It is understood to still hold this position.The end of the partnership comes in the wake of Coupang’s swoop on Farfetch, which saw the South Korean company buy the British fashion firm in a rescue deal after its value collapsed 99pc.The deal wiped out shareholders and many of the company’s bondholders.Bondholders have since demanded an investigation into the conduct of José Neves, the co-founder and chief executive of Farfetch.A spokesman for Neiman Marcus said the group had “decided to end its commercial partnership with Farfetch”.They added: “The Bergdorf Goodman website and app will continue to serve as the luxury ecommerce destination for its customers and will no longer be re-platforming onto Farfetch Platform Solutions... We appreciate Farfetch, which continues to be a minority investor in NMG.”A spokesperson for Farfetch said: “We continue to partner closely with thousands of brands and boutiques around the world to provide an elevated online luxury experience for millions of customers.”The FTSE 100 closed down 0.68pc.

No longer: their products are now typically on a par with German quality but at significantly lower prices. I remember being in Chongqing [in southwestern China] where the Germans built the first line on the metro system - trains, track escalators etc etc. There are now over 10 lines all built with no German input - but to the same standard. This isn’t new.

Bernstein, said:We expect positive long-term value commentary around Arm-based servers and laptops, but continue to believe we will have to wait for full-year 2025 for any significant recovery in royalty rates.Arm shares are up 2.1pc in trading today.The US trade deficit narrowed in 2023 to the smallest in three years, American government data showed Wednesday, while the country imported more goods from Mexico than China for the first time in about two decades.The latest figures add to a series of positive economic news for President Joe Biden, who has been working to boost sentiment on his handling of the economy as his November reelection campaign picks up pace.For all of 2023, the overall trade gap was $773.4bn, down 18.7 percent from the $951.2bn figure in the prior year, US Commerce Department figures showed.In 2022, the country saw the biggest deficit in government data dating back to 1960.But the latest numbers showed a fall in the goods deficit last year, with imports of products dropping more than exports.Purchases of supplies like crude oil and fuel oil fell, while Americans bought less consumer goods like clothing and cell phones as well.This was partly due to the unravelling of consumption patterns during the Covid-19 pandemic, during which people cooped up at home spent on items including electronics as they worked remotely.Meanwhile, exports of services increased last year, particularly in the travel sector, and the services surplus widened.Surprisingly resilient consumption last year has helped to support the US economy, but analysts expect higher interest rates to slow consumer spending and add pressure on imports.Shares in Snap, the company behind the social media app Snapchat, have plunged 34pc today after it released disappointing results and gave an uninspiring forecast for 2024.The stock market reaction wiped $958m off chief executive Evan Spiegel’s stake in the firm.In the final quarter of 2023, revenue rose 5pc to $1.36bn in the fourth quarter of 2023, missing the $1.38bn average of analysts’ estimates and disappointing investors after strong results for the quarter from Facebook owner Meta.The company continued to lose money, posting a loss of $1.3bn, although this was at a slightly lower level than in 2023.The company is continuing to forecast losses this year, with revenue growing by 11pc to 15pc.The company pre-empted the results by announcing on Monday that it would lay off about 10pc of its workforce, amounting to about 500 employees.Mr Spiegel said: “2023 was a pivotal year for Snap, as we transformed our advertising business and continued to expand our global community, reaching 414 million daily active users.“Snapchat enhances relationships with friends, family, and the world, and this unique value proposition has provided a strong foundation to build our business for long-term growth.”That’s all from me today. My colleague Alex Singleton will keep you furnished with the latest essential updates.The boss of Sainsbury’s has refused to rule out job losses under plans to slash costs by £1bn as the chain revealed it will cut general merchandise and clothing space and expand its food offering.The UK’s second biggest supermarket unveiled a strategy update that will see it boost food space across all its near-600 supermarkets, while focusing expansion efforts on 180 of its “highest potential” sites, which will see about 10pc more space dedicated to food.But it will also cut its general merchandise and clothing offering across many shops, with between 20pc to 30pc less store space for non-food ranges in the 180 shops.The retailer suggested jobs may be in the firing line, as it said it would cut costs by £1bn over the next three years, while investing in technology and artificial intelligence (AI).Chief executive Simon Roberts refused to rule out job losses as the group plans to use AI to increase automation.He said the group would look to “protect jobs as much as possible” by being flexible and to “re-skill” and “re-deploy where we can”.Our retail editor Hannah Boland has the

closer to wrenching control over euro clearing back from London today after reaching a key political agreement on new clearing rules.Our reporter Michael Bow has the latest:Officials from the EU Council and the EU Parliament backed a package of measures from the European Commission forcing banks clearing euro-derivatives trading to send a minimum portion of trades through EU-based institutions.The plan is designed to reduce reliance on London as a clearing centre post-Brexit.Despite broad support in Brussels, the proposals lack specific demands on the amount of clearing needed to be provided inside the EU.More than 90pc of euro-denominated clearing is done at London’s LCH, prompting fears in Brussels about a lack of oversight from the EU.UK and EU officials are still debating rules over equivalence, which allow the UK to clear euro-denominated contracts.Carlsberg has plunged to a £4.7bn loss after the Kremlin commandeered its Russian business.Our senior business reporter Daniel Woolfson has the details:Carlsberg’s Russian business unit, Baltika Breweries, was seized by Russian authorities last year after the Danish brewer tried to sell it and exit the country.The brewer said on Tuesday that the incident resulted in the company making a loss of 40.8bn Danish krone (£4.7bn) for the year.Carlsberg employed around 8,400 people in Russia prior to the seizure, and had been looking to sell the business amid pressure on consumer brands to leave Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.Read how the seizure of Carlsberg’s Russian business comes amid a

lower-than-expected sales revenue for the last quarter of 2023.Alibaba posted a 5pc increase in sales to 260.3bn yuan (£29bn) for the three months to December, slightly missing analyst estimates.Net income sank to 14.4bn yuan (£1.6bn), down 77pc compared to the same time last year.The Hangzhou-based business attributed the drastic drop in net income to the decrease in value of its equity investments and a decrease in income from operations due to that.Alibaba’s New York-listed stock price fell about 4pc in premarket trading following the report.Alibaba chief executive Eddie Wu said: “Our top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing.”Electric cars cannot be advertised as completely “zero emission” because of the carbon dioxide that is generated when they are made and charged, the advertising watchdog has declared.Our industry editor Matt Oliver has the details:In a ruling that will change how electric vehicles (EVs) are promoted, the Advertising Standards Authority has banned carmakers from referring to them as zero emission unless they make clear this is only while driving.The decision emerged as the regulator criticised BMW for describing its range of EVs as “zero emission cars” in Google searches.In the ruling, the ASA said: “We understood that when electric vehicles were driven no emissions were produced, unlike a car with a petrol or diesel engine where emissions came from the tailpipe.“However, in other circumstances, such as the manufacture or charging of an electric vehicle using electricity from the national grid, emissions were generated.”The ruling comes as demand for electric cars has waned.When was the last time you had a Breakaway bar? For many of you, the answer is “I have no idea” or “a very long time ago” and that is the way it is likely to stay forever.The Breakaway and Yorkie biscuit bars are to disappear from shelves following a decline in sales, maker Nestle has announced.The Yorkie Biscuit is not to be confused with Yorkie chocolate bars, which Nestle said are “staying for good”.Nestle said the chocolate-covered Breakaway will no longer be produced from March, to make way for new products.Breakaway fans can still buy the bar throughout February and March at Sainsbury’s while stocks last.The Breakaway, made with wholemeal, oat and coconut flours, was launched in 1970 by Rowntree Mackintosh before being acquired by Nestle in 1988.It follows Nestle blaming falling sales on its decision in November to discontinue the Caramac bar after 64 years.US stock indexes were subdued in premarket trading as investors grapple with uncertainty about the outlook for interest rate cuts.Ford jumped 6pc in premarket trading after the car maker increased its first-quarter dividend and decided to scale back investments in new capacity for loss-making electric vehicles. General Motors also added 1.4pc.On the flip side, Snap slumped 32.3pc after missing quarterly revenue estimates, as the Snapchat-owner struggled to compete for advertising dollars against heavyweights such as Meta and Alphabet. Peer Pinterest shed 3.8pc.Uber announced its first full-year operating profit and forecast quarterly core profit and gross bookings above estimates. However, its shares were last down 1.7pc ahead of the opening bell.Wall Street has been relatively quiet this week following a stellar performance in the months before which saw the benchmark S&P 500 hit record highs.In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc, the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq 100 was up 0.1pc.Uber secured its first full-year operating profit as its number of bookings jumped in the run-up to Christmas in what its boss said was a “standout quarter to cap off a standout year”.Operating income swung from a loss of $1.8bn (£1.4bn) to a profit of $1.1bn (£870m).Gross bookings - which includes deliver orders, ride hailing and driver earnings - grew 22pc to $37.6bn (£29.8bn) in the final three months of 2023.The number of trips and monthly active platform consumers grew 24pc and 15pc, respectively, compared to the same period the previous year.Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said:2023 was an inflection point for Uber, proving that we can continue to generate strong, profitable growth at scale.Our audiences are larger and more engaged than ever, with our platform powering an average of nearly 26 million daily trips last year.The German economy is already threatened by recession after output shrank 0.3pc in the final three months of last year.Our economics editor Szu Ping Chan analyses the backdrop for Europe’s largest economy:Analysts believe the German economy could shrink again in the current quarter as ailing manufacturers struggle to adapt to a world without cheap Russian energy after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.Stefan Schilbe, HSBC’s chief German economist, said there was “little hope for a change in trend” in the coming months.He added: “Nationwide strikes by rail and airport workers are likely to weigh on output in January and February. In addition, the global economic climate remains subdued, coupled with high geopolitical risks amid the situation in the Red Sea, high interest rates, and domestic energy prices still well above their pre-pandemic level. So German manufacturers face more of the same weakness at the beginning of this year.”The country is also struggling to deal with a property crisis driven by plunging prices and a collapse in building activity.Analysts highlighted that car production was bouncing back, though Carsten Brzeski at ING said an ongoing decline in energy-intensive production “could lengthen the process of bottoming out”.Mr Brzeski said: “Germany wouldn’t be Germany these days if there weren’t new problems weighing on the short-term outlook: strikes and supply chain disruptions as a result of the military conflict in the Red Sea have made another contraction in the German economy in the first quarter of the year even more likely.”Oil prices have edged higher after a two-day gain amid the geopolitical risk in the Middle East - and some analysts think prices could be about to shift higher.Brent crude was last up 0.6pc to tip above $79 a barrel after climbing 1.6pc over the previous two sessions, while West Texas Intermediate was up 0.6pc to just under $74.Houthi rebels said they targeted two ships in the southern Red Sea, the latest in a string of attacks that has forced a major re-routing of global trade. The US has vowed more strikes against Iranian forces and their proxies in the region.However, the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute has kept a lid on price rises for now after it said US nationwide crude inventories rose 674,000 barrels last week.Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at Swedish bank SEB, said signs of a revival in the global economy will eventually push prices higher as Saudi Arabia decides against increasing production. He said:With emerging signs of a global revival, it is very unlikely that Saudi/OPEC+ will cave in and switch from “price over volume” to “volume over price”.A potential revival implies a stronger demand impulse down the road.And if you look upon the world economy with the eyes of an optimist your take would probably be: Chinese policy has shifted focus to growth, Biden’ infrastructure stimulus package is stimulating the economy significantly, the EU is crawling out of the woods as natural gas prices have come down, India marches on, inflation globally is fading and interest rate cuts are coming.Philip Milton, public policy manager for fraud at Meta, told the Home Affairs Select Committee that the tech giant took the issue of fraud on the platform “extremely seriously”.Responding to evidence from the banking sector about large-scale fraud occurring on Facebook Marketplace, Mr Milton said fraud “fundamentally undermines the experience we’re trying to provide for people” and said this, combined with fraudulent advertising impacting trust in the company from advertisers, meant the tech giant was “directly incentivised” to do all it can to prevent criminal activity.When suggested by the committee that the evidence to MPs from the banks showed Meta was not doing all it could to prevent online fraud, Mr Milton said:I disagree with that. To give you an idea of the scale that we’re putting in place to tackle this kind of thing, since 2016 we’ve invested 20 billion dollars on safety and security, and that’s not slowing down - five billion of that was in the last year alone.We have 40,000 people working across the company on safety and security. Half of that number are involved in directly reviewing content, so we invest significantly in trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening.A quick look at the energy markets, where wholesale gas prices remain subdued as mild winter weather reduces demand for heating.Europe’s benchmark contract fell as much as 2.6pc today and was last down 0.2pc to less than €29 per megawatt hour.Prices have fallen more than 30pc since October as temperatures remained above usual levels, keeping already extra-full storage sites well stocked.The UK equivalent contract was down 0.7pc, having fallen as much as 3.2pc in early trading.The pound has risen against the dollar as the latest figures showed house prices in Britain rose at their fastest annual pace in a year - supporting bets that the Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates soon.Sterling was up 0.3pc to $1.26 as property values jumped for the fourth month in a row, according to Halifax.The pound was also up 0.2pc against the euro, which is worth 85p, as Bank of England policymaker Sarah Breeden said the next few months were “incredibly important” in assessing the impact of wages on inflation.Tumbling inflation and slowing pay growth could open the way to lower interest rates in the coming months, the Bank of England’s newest monetary policymaker has hinted.Our deputy economics editor Tim Wallace has the latest:Sarah Breeden, who joined the Monetary Policy Committee in November, said last year’s worries over the persistence of inflation have started to fade.In December “the question I was focused on was whether there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures which might mean we needed to tighten further,” she said.“As I have become more confident that persistence is likely to evolve as embodied within our forecast, I have become less concerned that rates might need to be tightened further. Instead my focus, and indeed the focus of many on the MPC, has shifted to thinking about how long rates need to remain at their current level.”Inflation stood at 4pc in December, lower than the Bank of England predicted but still twice its 2pc target.Ms Breeden said she will look for more evidence on wages and inflation before moving interest rates from their current level of 5.25pc.“The next few months will be incredibly important for my assessment of wage and price persistence, with the majority of this year’s wage setting processes set to conclude by April,” she said.Eight in 10 of the most commons financial frauds faced by consumers begin on social media, MPs have been told.Paul Davis, financial crime prevention director at TSB, told the Home Affairs Committee:The three main types of fraud that impact our customers are purchase scams, they’re the most common, although they tend to be lower value; investment scams, which are a bit less common but tend to be very high value; and impersonation scams.For those three types, which as I say are the main ones, we see about 80pc start on social media.Indeed, let’s not walk past the fact that when I say social media there, the majority of them start from the channels owned by one company in particular, which is Meta.He added: “For purchase scams, we find Facebook Marketplace is the main place where those scams originate.”Shares in Imperial Leather maker PZ Cussons have plunged after the consumer goods giant revealed it had swung to a loss, as it continues to be rocked by volatility in the Nigerian economy.The Manchester-based maker of household brands including Imperial Leather, Carex and St.Tropez said “we have clearly had our challenges” as it unveiled its half-year results.The company showed it swung to a statutory pre-tax loss of £94.2m in the six months to December, down from a profit of £40.5m the previous year.Revenues fell by nearly 18pc over the same period, from £336.9m to £277.1m.The business has a major market in Nigeria, which represents more than a third of its total sales, and has regularly stressed a prolonged slump in the value of the naira, the country’s currency, has wiped money from its sales.It said the currency is about 70pc weaker than a year ago, which represents the biggest drop in value in its history. Inflation in the region is also at a 30-year high of nearly 30pc.PZ Cussons said this led to foreign exchange losses of about £88m, dragging on its profits and sales.Shares in PZ Cussons were down as much as 20.1pc to take it to the bottom of the FTSE 250.Siemens Energy swung to a €1.6bn (£1.3bn) net profit thanks to a one-off gain from the sale of a subsidiary to its parent company.Our energy editor Jonathan Leake has the latest:The troubled German-based company, which makes wind turbines used in many UK wind farms, is recovering from a financial crisis caused partly by quality issues in some of its onshore models and partly by industry-wide inflation and supply problems.Last year those crises forced it to seek financial guarantee from the German government for some of its projects.Siemens Energy has become a vital part of the UK wind industry. It owns a turbine blade factory in Hull that employs 1,200 people and which supplies many of the windfarms being built around the UK. Overall the company employs 6,000 people in the UK.President and chief executive Christian Bruch said the company was getting back on course.He said: “The solid first quarter is encouraging... our focus remains on solving the quality problems in our onshore wind business and making the most of the growth potential for the rest of the company.”Pandora, the world’s biggest jewellery maker, said its performance since the start of the year has been “healthy” with high single-digit sales growth, as it announced a share buyback programme after a strong run.Pandora, which sells charm bracelets, has been a rare bright spot among retailers and brands targeting aspirational consumers with affordable luxury items.The company aims for organic revenue growth of 6pc-9pc in 2024, after reporting strong sales of its silver charms and bracelets which have helped its share price to more than double since the start of last year.Soren Lontoft Hansen, senior analyst at Sydbank, said: “Despite the worldwide macroeconomic uncertainties… the company is manoeuvring strongly and better than the market.”The growth target is in line with a goal set in October for a 7-9pc compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2026.Pandora also announced a share buyback programme of up to 4 billion Danish krona (£457.1m), and a dividend of 18 Danish crowns per share. Its shares rose 0.5pc at the open.UK shares have edged downwards in early trading amid a a sell-off in precious mining stocks and uncertainty over interest rate cuts.The blue-chip FTSE 100 was down 0.2pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 index was flat.It was a good start for housebuilders after house prices rose at their the strongest annual rate in a year last month, adding to tentative signs of momentum in the property market.Developers across the FTSE 100 and 250 gained as much as 1.7pc before settling at gains of 0.1pc as a merger between Barratt and Redrow was also announced.Barratt Developments shares dropped as much as 8.9pc to the bottom of the FTSE 100 while Redrow shares climbed as much as 16.7pc to the peak of the FTSE 250.However, markets were dragged down by precious metal miners, which shed as much as 1.2pc on lower gold prices, ahead of speeches by Federal Reserve officials through the week.Soap maker PZ Cussons forecast a lower annual profit and slashed its interim dividend, sending its shares as much as 16.6pc lower to the bottom of FTSE 250.Analysts have been bashing away at their keyboards to make sense of Barratt’s takeover of rival housebuilder Redrow.Quilter Cheviot property fund research analyst Oli Creasey said:By some measures, Barratt is already the largest public housebuilder in the UK. It isn’t the most valuable company by market cap, but the volume of houses built in the past year is ahead of any of its peers.So we wouldn’t categorise this transaction as a need to build scale. However, there is likely to be a some element of cost synergies to be harvested as a result of combining two companies in the same industry, and a limited amount of geographical overlap.Looking at share prices, the deal is an attractive one for Redrow shareholders, who get a boost to the undisturbed share price, and become holders in a much larger business.It is less clear what the advantage is for Barratt, although given the structure of the deal, there’s limited downside – the all-share deal means that no cash needs to change hands, and the balance sheet strength is unchanged.It should also be noted that at a price equal to 1.2x Redrow’s NAV, it isn’t a particularly expensive price being paid, and will create the undisputed largest public housebuilder in the UK.German industrial production fell for a seventh straight month, official data showed, marking its longest series of declines since the period after reunification in the early 1990s.Output plunged by 1.6pc in December compared to the previous month, federal statistics agency Destatis said, following a revised 0.2pc fall in November.The drop was far worse than the 0.35pc decline predicted by analysts at FactSet and caps the longest run of falls since 1993.Melanie Debono at Pantheon Macroeconomics described the figures as “ugly”, adding: “The recession in industry will continue this quarter.”The sharper-than-expected decline was driven by steep falls in the chemical industry and the construction sector. The car industry meanwhile saw a 4pc rise in production.For the whole of 2023, industrial output was 1.5pc lower than a year earlier, Destatis said, and still below pre-pandemic levels.Germany’s crucial industrial sector, which used to be heavily reliant on cheap Russian gas imports, has been reeling ever since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine pushed energy costs higher.Higher interest rates and weaker export demand have added to the economic headwinds, as its economy shrank by 0.3pc last year.Capital Economics economist Franziska Palmas said that industry “remains a significant drag on growth”.She added: “We expect this to continue throughout 2024.”Die reale #Produktion im Produzierenden Gewerbe ist Dezember 2023 gegenüber November 2023 voraussichtlich um 1,6 % gesunken. Im Gesamtjahr 2023 lag sie um 1,5 % unter dem Vorjahr.

It also cancelled Ocean 2, also off the New Jersey coast, where construction was planned to start in 2028.The company recorded losses of 20.2bn Danish Kroner - about £2.2bn. This was despite operating profits of 19bn Danish kroner - about £2.2bn.TotalEnergies has reported the highest profit in its history - but still missed analyst expectations despite outperforming peers like Shell and BP.The French company said profit came in at $21.4bn (£17bn) in 2023, an increase of 4pc on the previous year but below predictions of $23.7bn.Its bottom line put the French energy conglomerate ahead of Shell, BP, Exxon-Mobil and Chevron, which all reported lower earnings in the face of weaker energy prices.However, TotalEnergies’s 2022 net profit had been weighed down by a huge exceptional charge - $15bn - from its withdrawal from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.Once non-recurring items were stripped out, profits suffered a sharp downturn last year, with adjusted net profit falling 36pc to $23.2bn.Oil and gas prices dropped some 10pc on average last year from 2022 when spiking oil prices had boosted earnings at energy companies worldwide.Chairman Patrick Pouyanne called the results “robust”, saying in a statement they had been achieved in “an uncertain environment”. Hydrocarbons had performed well, he said.It has been a mixed story for the shares of Barratt and Redrow after the announcement of their merger.Barratt shares have slipped 3.7pc - perhaps as shareholders bulk at the idea of holding 67.2pc of a combined company.Meanwhile, Redrow shares have surged by as much as 17pc after recommending the takeover, which values the business at £2.5bn.Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:The economic winds have not been kind to the housebuilders and Barratt Developments and Redrow clearly believe they’ll be stronger together, giving the new combined company much bigger clout to capitalise on the structural need for housing in the UK.Redrow’s share price has struggled to regain its pre-pandemic form and with Barratt enjoying a strong balance sheet and hefty cash reserves it clearly decided the time was right to make a move.Clearly market conditions are still going to be tougher while interest rates stay elevated.However, the latest signs are that recovery is underway, with the Halifax house price index pointing to renewed sentiment among buyers, as better mortgage deals have landed.The FTSE 100 opened higher following large gains on Wall Street and after Chinese regulators issued another set of market-enhancing policies.The UK’s blue chip index began the day up 0.1pc to 7,688.72 while the midcap FTSE 250 rose 0.2pc to 19,208.63.Sainsbury’s has unveiled plans to overhaul its supermarkets with a focus on creating more food space and revealed aims to slash costs by £1bn over the next three years.The UK’s second biggest supermarket chain said it would cut its general merchandise offering and clothing offering across many sites to create more space for food and ensure it is offering full grocery ranges in more stores.In its strategy update, the group said it will also “tighten the focus” of its non-food ranges, while adding there would be more changes for its Argos store estate, having already shut a raft of sites to bring many within supermarkets since it bought the retailer.The new plan - called Next Level Sainsbury’s - will see it cut costs by £1bn over the next three years, focusing on technology investments to deliver automation and savings.The increase in house prices for a fourth month in a row puts Britain about halfway towards a 3pc increase in house prices this year already, according to economists.Andrew Wishart, senior property economist at Capital Economics, said:The Halifax index has a track record of being quick to respond to changes in mortgage rates, so the large increases of 1.1pc in December and 1.3pc in January reflect the swift drop in the average quoted mortgage rate from 5pc in November to about 4.5pc in January.Fixed mortgage rates are unlikely to fall any further in the near term, which will restrain future monthly gains in the Halifax index.As the increase mirrored a large rise in the Nationwide index for the same month, there is little doubt that house prices made a strong start to the year.He added: “While we doubt that will continue (prices would rise by over 10pc this year if it did), our non-consensus call that house prices will rise this year looks like the right one.”The tie-up between Barratt and Redrow is expected to eventually lead to savings of at least £90m a year, the companies said.It comes as British housebuilders recover from the worst downturn since the financial crisis as high property prices and mortgage rates triggered a slump in sales last year.Last summer house price falls in July were more widespread than at any point since 2009, according to Rics’ UK residential market survey of estate agents.Redrow chief executive Matthew Pratt said:Redrow and Barratt combined creates a leading UK homebuilder.Together, we’ll be in a much better position to offer a broader range of high-quality and energy efficient homes to customers.He added: “The Redrow brand, with its premium, characterful homes, has an excellent reputation and will remain a key part of the Combined Group. As with Barratt, Redrow’s fifty-year success story is based on its people, products and supply chain partners. Both businesses are a great fit and there are many exciting opportunities to innovate and share knowledge across a range of different areas.”House builder Barratt will merge with its rival developer Redrow as the sector consolidates after the downturn caused by high interest rates.Barratt said it will buy the entire issued and to be issued share capital of its rival as part of the deal, creating a combined group which will be renamed as Barratt Redrow.The merger deal will offer Redrow shareholders 1.44 of new Barratt shares at a premium of 27.2pc, valuing the developer at £2.5bn.Once the takeover is complete, Redrow shareholders will hold approximately 32.8pc of the combined group and Barratt shareholders will hold approximately 67.2pc.Barratt chief executive David Thomas said the combined businesses “would leverage the respective strengths of both Barratt and Redrow, delivering significant benefits to our people, our supply chains, and - most importantly - our customers”.Redrow founder Steve Morgan added that Barratt is a home builder he has “long admired,” while chief executive Matthew Pratt said the combined companies “creates a leading UK homebuilder”House prices rose last month as falling mortgage rates increased the number of potential buyers, according to an industry survey.Property values increased by 1.3pc in January compared to the previous month, according to the Halifax house price index.It was the fourth monthly gain in a row after six consecutive falls before that.The survey found that average house prices increased to £291,029, which was £3,900 more than last month.Compared to the same month last year, property prices grew by 2.5pc, which was the highest annual growth since January 2023.Halifax Mortgages director Kim Kinnaird said:The recent reduction of mortgage rates from lenders as competition picks up, alongside fading inflationary pressures and a still-resilient labour market has contributed to increased confidence among buyers and sellers. This has resulted in a positive start to 2024’s housing market.However, while housing activity has increased over recent months, interest rates remain elevated compared to the historic lows seen in recent years and demand continues to exceed supply.For those looking to buy a first home, the average deposit raised is now £53,414, around 19pc of the purchase price. It’s not surprising that almost two thirds (63pc) of new buyers getting a foot on the ladder are now buying in joint names.Looking ahead, affordability challenges are likely to remain and further modest falls should not be ruled out, against a backdrop of broader uncertainty in the economic environment.Thanks for joining me. House prices increased for a fourth month in a row following the recent reduction in mortgage rates from lenders, according to the latest Halifax house price index.Average house prices increased to £291,029, which was £3,900 more than last month.1) Lockdown generation lacks basic workplace skills, says City grandee | Employers have noticed the negative impact on young recruits of lockdown measures, according to Baroness McGregor-Smith2) Bank of England pushed Britain into recession, economists say | Threadneedle Street has refused to communicate interest rates plan, economists say3) Why resurgent Ireland can’t afford to reunite – yet | Financial burden of absorbing the North could weigh down Dublin’s buoyant economy4) AI will trigger global surge in gas demand, says BP boss | Boom in tools such as ChatGPT means data centres require more power5) Jeremy Warner: The cost of lockdown is still becoming more devastating by the day | Young Britons will continue to pay the price of lost education for a generation to comeAsian stocks firmed on Wednesday as investors waited to see if Beijing’s increasingly frantic efforts to prop up its sagging share markets would actually work, while bonds enjoyed a reprieve from recent selling.In recent days, China’s regulators have announced further curbs on short selling and state investors said they were expanding their stock buying plans.Bloomberg News also reported President Xi Jinping would discuss the stock market with financial regulators, though there was no confirmation this had happened or what was discussed.However, the jury is very much out on how effective all this will prove and the blue chip index inched up 0.4% in choppy early trade, while Shanghai stocks added 0.9%.Tokyo’s blue-chip Nikkei shares drifted lower as investors digested corporate earnings.The benchmark Nikkei 225 index eased 0.1pc, or 40.74 points, to end at 36,119.92, while the broader Topix index added 0.4pc, or 10.70 points, at 2,549.95.Wall Street drifted higher during a quiet Tuesday as the bond market calmed down following some sharp swings.The S&P 500 rose 0.2pc, to 4,954.23, and nearly returned to its all-time high set at the end of last week.

Options Trader Wagers That Meta Shares Will Double Again`(Bloomberg) -- An options trader appears to be looking to parlay a winning bet on Meta Platforms Inc. into an even bigger windfall if the tech giant doubles — again — in the next 18 months.Most Read from BloombergHaley Loses Nevada Primary to ‘None of These Candidates’ OptionChina Replaces Top Markets Regulator as Xi Tries to End RoutTesla Asks Which Jobs Are Critical, Stoking Layoff FearsUS Commercial Real Estate Contagion Is Now Moving to EuropeTrump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals CourtEarly Wednesday, a trader sold a block of 19,000 call options that expire in June 2025 and allow the holder to purchase 1.9 million shares at $600, in exchange for twice as many calls with a $950 strike price expiring a year later, collecting $11.4 million.Holders of call options in Meta and other megacap tech stocks have seen ballooning profits, both from the increase in share prices that makes the options more valuable, but also the seeming unquenchable demand from investors looking to bet on further gains. Unlike most stocks, where there is a pronounced premium for bearish option contracts versus bullish as investors look to protect against losses, the incessant tech rally has flipped that on its head.“Meta is an example of a stock with skew to the calls,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group, adding that it’s rare to see this in an large cap equity and is an indication of “panic to the upside.”Selling the earlier calls — which appear to have been bought in mid-July when Meta was trading around $309 a share — likely netted millions of dollars in profits, though it’s hard to be sure as the position may have been rolled in July from an even lower level as shares rallied.While $950 seems like a far-away level, Meta shares doubled from November 2022 to March 2023, and doubled again between then and January.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went WrongThe Story Elon Musk Doesn’t Want to Talk AboutLayoffs Show That Tech Jobs Aren’t Sacred AnymoreHSBC’s New ‘Wise Killer’ App Vies for FX CustomersThe Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

Why Snap (SNAP) Stock Is Nosediving`Shares of social network Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) fell 34.5% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and average revenue per user (ARPU) missing analysts' expectations amid elevated expectations around changes in the direct response business. User growth was steady, with DAU (daily active users) ahead of estimates as net additions in Europe and the Rest of the World more than offset the customer attrition recorded in North America. This North America attrition is sure to ring alarm bells about competition, with Meta (NASDAQ:META) recently reporting very encouraging results.While next quarter's revenue guidance was in line, adjusted EBITDA guidance was well below. This shows that Snap's growth is coming at higher costs or less efficiency than expected. Moreover, the ARPU miss and the weakness in North America DAU indicate a challenging road ahead if the company aims to surpass expectations in the upcoming quarter. During the earnings call, management hinted at potential growth investments in North America and Europe and expressed optimism about avoiding further declines in North America in Q1. Overall, this was a mediocre quarter for Snap as the market was likely expecting more, considering the strong result reported by Meta earlier in the season.The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Snap? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.Snap's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 26 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Snap and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company gained 7.1% on the news that Meta reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector also suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024.Snap is down 29.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $11.33 per share it is trading 35.1% below its 52-week high of $17.45 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Snap's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,326.Do you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners`"In this article, we discuss 10 best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners. Global stocks reached their highest point in over two years, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record high on February 7, as per Reuters. This was driven by robust earnings, which helped counter concerns surrounding US regional banks and the Chinese markets. Bonds experienced slight pressure, as statements from Federal Reserve officials reinforced the expectation that the central bank might not reduce interest rates in the near future. According to Arthur Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth: ""We are at the midpoint of the 4Q earnings reporting season, and we would say that there has been more good news than bad.""In 2023, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 26.29%, recovering from the setback of 18.11% in 2022. In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts. The potential combination of declining interest rates and earnings growth is seen as a positive for stocks. However, analysts express worries about overvalued technology sector stocks, and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to introduce significant market volatility.Looking at historical data from 1921 to 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research, noted that the average S&P 500 bull market has yielded a return of 157% and lasted over four years. This historical pattern suggests the possibility of the stock market rally continuing in the foreseeable future. One notable success in the current bull market has been the performance of artificial intelligence technology as an investment theme. AI stocks were among the top performers in 2023, contributing to the market's overall positive trajectory. James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, commented: “The market’s recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI.” On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee suggests a more cautious outlook for 2024, anticipating an average year for markets rather than double-digit gains. Concerns include the S&P 500's elevated forward price/earnings ratio and a historically low equity risk premium. Valuations indicate potential sub-par annual stock returns, with estimates pointing to a 4% gain compared to the long-run average of 7%-8%. Analysts' optimistic projections for 2024 U.S. corporate earnings are questioned, with expectations of a tapering in economic growth from 7% to 4%. The market's assumption of a more aggressive Fed rate-cutting stance contrasts with public signals, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions as emergency programs wind down in 2024.Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, remarked: “As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.” Some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology For this list, we used a stock screener and selected stable companies with high single digit or low-teens revenue growth.

The list is sorted in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders. Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Quarterly Revenue Growth: 14.10%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company in the United States with four segments – UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. UnitedHealthcare offers health benefit plans for employers and individuals, Medicaid plans, and children's health insurance.On January 12, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $6.16 and a revenue of $94.4 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.17 and $2.22 billion, respectively.

The Company reported double-digit revenue, operating earnings and earnings per share growth during their third quarter. The Company has been able to adjust pricing in its health care segment to keep up with medical cost inflation while working with its Optum units to deliver more value-based care that replaces the traditional fee for service health care model. Value-based care is a sensible, long-term growth opportunity for the Company to pursue and also differentiates it from the vast majority of healthcare providers, particularly as it relates to Medicare patients. For example, the Company’s value-based care programs provide more preventative care opportunities and home-based care visits for patients which helps save the U.S. healthcare system billions in unnecessary spending while also providing patients with better outcomes, as diseases and behaviors are caught or corrected at earlier stages. The Company has invested in several core assets over many years to execute this value-based strategy and it will become the standard of care as the proportion of people in the U.S. with healthcare insurance coverage continues to reach new highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.00%JPMorgan Chase & Co.

After a 31% For Vote on executive compensation in 2022, the Board will not be granting any special awards to Jamie Dimon or Daniel Pinto and if awarded to other Named Executive Officers, there will be a direct performance condition associated with the award. The Compensation Committee limited the cash percentage of Dimon and Pinto’s compensation.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Quarterly Revenue Growth: 10.20%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, and other products for data centers, gaming, and embedded applications. It is one of the best cheap beginner stocks to invest in. On February 1, Citi analyst Christopher Danely observed that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, anticipating $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi suggested that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) may intentionally be underestimating, and the company's CEO expressed confidence in surpassing the $3.5 billion figure for this year. The analyst estimated that AMD could generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from its MI300, according to buy-side investors' expectations.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion. White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.60%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), a diversified software company, operates globally through three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising.

(NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.30%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a global provider of customer relationship management technology, facilitating the connection between companies and customers. The company's services include sales tools for data management, lead monitoring, progress tracking, and analytics.

Sills highlighted Salesforce's competitive advantage with a significant market share of only 15% and a robust moat derived from its extensive installed base of over 150,000 customers in the core sales/front office category.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 122 hedge funds were bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), same as the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with roughly 15 million shares worth $4 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) ranks 6th on our list of the top cheap stocks for beginners in 2024. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners.  Suggested articles:Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks15 Best Bitcoin Wallets For iPhone and Android11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 00:58:29.218431`AMZN
Do Not Fight this Market: 3 Top Ranked Stock to Join the Rally`After such a strong finish in 2023 and follow through at the start of 2024, investors are wondering when the correction is coming. While it is natural to expect some sort of pull-back I think investors would be best off not trying to predict, and instead continue buying top-ranked stocks.Below we can see the Nasdaq 100 is breaking out of this bullish looking consolidation, and the S&P 500 is very nearly pushing through the 5,000 level.Image Source: TradingViewFurthermore, there are many powerful investment themes keeping the markets bid, including a robust economy, exciting technological developments, and tremendous government spending deficits. That last item is definitely worth considering when wondering when the economy is going to slowdown.Because of the massive spending behind the most recent infrastructure bill, where more than $1 trillion is going to be spent, many laid off workers are likely to be soaked up by the public sector, and spending to continue.Based on these influential economic developments, investors should focus on continuing to buy leading stocks with top Zacks ranks, because a major economic slowdown is becoming less and less likely.Here I will share three stocks with top Zacks ranks, and market beating performance over the last month. I particularly like to look for stocks showing relative strength while the market continues to grind higher.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMercadoLibreMercadoLibre MELI, is the Latin-American version of Amazon, building an e-commerce platform that continues to boom in popularity. MercadoLibre has been one of the most exciting stocks in the last few years and its returns continue to delight investors willing to own shares.In addition to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, the company is forecasting impressive growth in sales and earnings.This year, sales are expected to climb 36% YoY to $14.3 billion, while EPS are set to expand 134% to $22.30 per share. That growth is projected to continue on to the next year as well, with sales expected to grow 22.3% the following year, and EPS to increase 57.6%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to the fundamental developments in MercadoLibre, its technical advances are compelling as well. In addition to relative strength against the market, it has been forming a very nice technical trade pattern to measure a breakout trade from.For investors waiting for a technical signal to enter MELI, a move above $1764 would market a clean breakout from this bullish consolidation.Image Source: TradingViewStoneCoStoneCo STNE is a Brazilian financial technology company specializing in payment processing solutions. Founded in 2012, StoneCo provides a range of services, including electronic payments, credit card processing, and point-of-sale technology for businesses of varying sizes.StoneCo has seen earnings estimates steadily trend higher over the last 10 months, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Additionally, the company is entering a period where EPS are expected to expand significantly. Earnings are forecast to grow 167% YoY this year, and 36.1% next year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MercadoLibre, StoneCo stock is forming a convincing technical pattern. STNE stock was hit hard at the end of 2022 and traded sideways at a depressed level for nearly two years.However, at the end of 2023, the stock initiated a stage one breakout, indicating investors had been buying the depressed stock. Now over the last two months, STNE price action has built out a weekly bull flag, leading me to believe another big breakout is coming.If STNE stock trades above the $18.50 level, investors could rush in to buy the stock sending it significantly higher.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon.comFinally, one of the world's leading companies, Amazon AMZN just reported an incredibly strong quarter of financials sending the stock much higher.Following the earnings gap up, Amazon stock is forming a post earnings consolidation, a very high probability trading setup. Above $171 and AMZN should make a run at its all-time high.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon has also been garnering interest from analysts, who have been steadily upgrading earnings estimates. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 22% and current quarter earnings by 12.5%.Earnings at the e-commerce and technology giant are expected to grow by an impressive 28.1% annually over the next 3-5 years, driven by its AWS and new advertising business segments.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe great thing about investing in stocks is that the best ones offer tremendous asymmetric opportunities. There is no reason to try and predict market selloffs, because so long as you focus on buying top-tier securities, the returns take care of themselves. That is not to say that risk management isn’t key, but good investors are often optimists. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Down 61% in the Past Year, Has This E-Commerce Stock Entered Bargain Territory?`The last 12 months were a good period in general for e-commerce stocks. Companies like Amazon, Shopify, MercadoLibre, and Pinduoduo saw their share prices rise at least 30%.But the industry had its laggards too, including JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), which saw its shares fall 61% in the past year. With the stock now down 78% from its all-time high, JD.com has attracted some investors looking to take advantage of a potential bargain.But before you rush into the stock, you should understand how JD.com got here in the first place. Only then can you make an informed investment decision.JD.com is one of the more successful companies replicating Amazon's playbook.The e-commerce giant operates a first-party e-commerce business in China by selling a wide range of products directly to customers. It also operates a third-party marketplace that allows other sellers on its platform, in exchange for fees from each successful transaction.The company emphasizes low prices to encourage customers to buy more over time, and it operates a complex logistics service to offer speedy deliveries. The low prices and fast delivery leads to strong customer retention and sales growth, providing JD.com with the scale needed to drive prices even lower and continuously improve its service.Customers love the approach, which explains the company's uninterrupted growth for many years. For perspective, revenue grew revenue at a compound annual rate of 27% from 2017 to 2021. Everything seemed to be moving in the right direction until recently.Investors accustomed to such an impressive track record were disappointed when the e-commerce company reported just 10% revenue growth in 2022. Subsequent months were even more challenging for the company with revenue growth declining to just 2% in Q3 2023. Revenue from its flagship first-party e-commerce business actually fell 1% year over year, masked by a 13% increase in service revenue.To add salt to the wound, competitor PDD Holdings reported 94% top-line growth in the same quarter. Even Alibaba, which is facing its own challenges, reported 9% growth.JD.com is failing to keep up with the competition. It didn't help that previous CEO Xu Lei stepped down from his post in May 2023 after just one year, adding another layer of uncertainty to the company's future.The silver lining here is the fact the company is still profitable with a strong balance sheet. JD.com generated 39 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in free cash flow in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2023. It also had 242 billion yuan ($33.2 billion) in cash and short-term investments. With this solid financial position, JD.com can continue to invest in areas like live-streaming shopping, supply chain improvements, and other initiatives.Still, investors should be aware the path ahead remains challenging as it will have to outmaneuver rivals like Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and Douyin.So JD.com is at a crossroads. Despite its previous success, the future is far less certain now that it faces a more competitive industry and greater regulatory scrutiny.Given the recent bearish sentiment, JD.com stock trades at a significant discount to other e-commerce companies with a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is just 10.2, while Pinduoduo trades at 27.8 times earnings.Investors should monitor JD.com's rebound efforts in the coming quarters for clues of its progress. If the company can defend its position as a top three e-commerce platform in China and rekindle growth, its current stock price should prove to be a bargain.Should you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?Before you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JD.com wasn’t one of them.

3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now`"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is off to a great start in 2024. The e-commerce giant is making progress along all fronts of its multifaceted business, and its stock is up 66% over the past year.You might not realize that it's still trading below all-time highs. But the way things are going, Amazon stock is likely to surpass that in the coming months, and now is a great time to buy it.Here are three specific reasons to be confident about Amazon stock this year.Amazon made a strategic decision last year to restructure its distribution network from a national one to a regional one. The rationale was that the national network was large and cumbersome, making it take longer, on average, to get products to customers. A regional network stocked with high-selling items would get products to customers faster and at a lower cost.It now has eight regional distribution centers, and the results speak for themselves. In the 2023 fourth quarter, Amazon delivered 65% more items overnight than in the prior year. CEO Andy Jassy noted that as Amazon fulfills orders faster, customers choose it for more orders.In a first since 2018, Amazon has decreased its per-unit cost to fulfill globally, and in the U.S., fulfillment cost per unit decreased by more than $0.45 from last year. This allows Amazon to expand its selection profitably at lower average selling prices, improving its chances of gaining market share.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud services arm. Until recently, AWS sales were reliable to grow at rates around 35% in a typical quarter. That began to drop when inflation became severe, and client businesses started to cut their budgets.However, Amazon continues to lead the industry with 32% of the overall market according to Statista, and sales growth improved in the fourth quarter to 13% year over year. Jassy said the company is seeing larger deals accelerate; it announced several new deals with companies like Salesforce, BMW, and Nvidia.The company launched a robust suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services for AWS, and adoption rates are strong. The company offers three layers of AI to meet the varied needs of its clients, from the most customizable to partially customizable, with the top layer being a generative AI ""coded companion."" Last week, Amazon launched Rufus, a personal shopping generative AI application that takes customer queries and offers product recommendations based on requirements.Jassy said Amazon will continue to invest heavily in AI since it offers the opportunity to revolutionize the shopping and processing experience for its customers, and it sees this as a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years.Amazon only started to break out advertising as its own business segment in late 2021, when it grew 32% year over year, trailing AWS at 40%. With the other businesses slowing down, advertising has become the fastest-growing reporting segment, increasing 26% over last year in the 2023 fourth quarter. That was driven by sponsored ads.Advertising is a no-brainer for Amazon third-party sellers since it exposes them to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers. Amazon's top AI helps them target potential buyers with high accuracy.Amazon recently changed its streaming program to an ad-supported track, like Netflix and Walt Disney, which should pump up this segment even more. This will likely remain a strong business for Amazon in the near term, and as advertisers revisit their budgets after inflation-induced cuts, they're liable to spend more. Some percentage of that will go to Amazon.These are only part of the story. Amazon is making strides in smaller endeavors like cashierless stores, healthcare, and more. 2024 could be a banner year for Amazon, and in the long term, it's likely to add value to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks`"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 5 Stocks.Jim Cramer said in a latest program that after listening to the Fed chair Jerome Powell he believes we are at ""crossroads"" since there is still ""some inflation"" and the ""dichotomy"" of hard landing versus soft landing is being ""replaced by no landing."" Cramer said that we are ""back to reality"" and the reality, according to Cramer, is that interest rates are still ""not that high."" Cramer believes the rates are at a level where the economy can keep working. Cramer wondered how and why the Fed would cut interest rates when strong employment numbers keep coming and inflation is also not going down significantly.Jim Cramer tried to convince his viewers to invest in the stock market and said that while it would seem ""reckless"" to invest in the stock market because of the risks involved, it would be ""too late"" to invest in stocks once the Fed begins to cut interest rates. Jim Cramer said that stocks are in a win-win situation. If the economy keeps growing and the market remains strong, stocks will go up. If the economy begins to slow down, the Fed would cut rates sometime in the future, causing a rally in the stock market. Jim Cramer, however, acknowledged that stocks are risky when compared to the steady 5% income on CDs.Cramer said ""great"" stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can give you that ""5% from CDs"" in ""a week or even a day.""Cramer said that he has ""no illusions"" and he is convinced that now is the right time to buy stocks. Cramer said he thinks many investors would be inclined towards investing in low-risk index funds or parking their cash in CDs or treasuries but he thinks big money will be made by investing in individual stocks.But Jim Cramer is not bullish on all stocks. In fact over the past couple of years or so he's become quite selective in his choices and keeps recommending investors to sell or stay away from low-quality, money-losing or risky stocks and instead buy best of breed and high quality stocks.In this article we will talk about some stocks Cramer is bearish on.MethodologyFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to either stay away from or sell. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment where available. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/ASports and outdoor equipment company Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) recently went public in an IPO that fell short of expectations. Cramer had advised investors to stay away from the stock. He said:“So far, this is looking like another out of favor IPO, even if its lowball price allowed the stock to get a like, I guess you could call it a decent pop. And, I’ve got to tell you, Amer Sports is a great example of the kind of deals I wish we weren’t seeing.”One of the reasons why Cramer is bearish on Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) is the company's high exposure to China.While Cramer is bearish on the stock, Canadian billionaire Chip Wilson, who also founded Lululemon Athletica, bought $324 million worth of shares at the company’s IPO.While Cramer is bearish on companies like Amer Sports, he's recommending buying high-quality mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 9Last month, Jim Cramer was asked about Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC). Cramer recommended the questioner to ""take a pass"" on the stock. Cramer said the ""greatest inventor of our time"" Elon Musk does not like lithium companies and he is trying to figure out a way to cut our dependence on them. Cramer said he would not go against Musk.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Surgical facilities company Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on these days. When asked about Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) in a recent program on CNBC, Cramer said ""that industry is in up and down right now.""""I'm taking a hard pass,"" Cramer said of Surgery Partners.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The biggest stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is owned by Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $157 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting.

3 Inspiring Underdogs That Fought Tech Giants and Won`"When it comes to success in emerging industries, size usually matters. Pioneers often fail, leaving behind the foundation for larger players to dominate. Thankfully for investors in mold-breaking upstarts, it doesn't always play out that way.Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Sonos (NASDAQ: SONO), and Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) are three companies that saw Apple and other consumer tech behemoths try to take them out. The little guys are not just surviving, but thriving against established titans with almost limitless resources. Take a bow Roku, Sonos, and Spotify.Roku founder Anthony Wood invented the digital video recorder, but it was another company that enjoyed the DVR glory. He got it right when he launched Roku a few years later, pioneering the streaming video revolution. It wasn't long before Roku was joined by some of the most valuable companies on the planet. Apple TV, Alphabet's Google Chromecast, and Amazon's Fire TV hit the market. Roku didn't flinch.Roku remains the leading operating system for smart TVs in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It has roughly double the market share of its closest rival. It doesn't matter that Google and Amazon are willing to practically give away the hardware to get folks connected. Roku has been able to sacrifice product margins, knowing it can make it up in volume.Roku is free to use, making the lion's share of its revenue from ad sharing and referrals. It's working. Average revenue per user is more than $41 over the past year. There are 75.8 million active accounts on the platform, and boy are they active. Roku users are spending an average of 3.8 hours a day streaming through the Roku hub.It doesn't seem possible. Roku is competing against Apple, a company that is used to getting people to pay a premium for its wares. Alphabet is the global leader in online advertising, putting it in the perfect position to cash in on an ad-supported industry. Amazon is the top dog in online retail, and it aggressively promotes its Fire TV dongles and smart TVs on its platform. Roku is still beating them all.Roku's enemies are also rivals of Sonos. It was 2005 when Sonos rolled out the first wireless multiroom speaker system, which streams audio seamlessly through a home. Audiophiles flocked to Sonos, but then familiar foes emerged. Apple, Amazon, and Google all had cheap smart speakers in support of their virtual assistant technologies. Sonos was in their crosshairs if they chose to go upmarket, but they missed.Sonos would go on to deliver 17 consecutive years of revenue growth before proving mortal in fiscal 2023. On Tuesday afternoon it posted financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. It was a well-received report.Revenue declined 9%, or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. It's not pretty, but analysts were bracing for a 13% decline. The bigger surprise is at the other end of the income statement. Profitability improved at Sonos, earning $0.64 a share for the seasonally potent holiday quarter, up from $0.57 a share a year earlier. Wall Street pros were settling for a sharp decline to $0.39 a share.""Despite the challenging environment, we are winning in the market and outperforming the competition,"" CEO Patrick Spence said in this week's earnings report.Rich in cash and patents, Sonos is well positioned to continue dominating its high-end niche. With analyst profit targets now likely headed higher, Sonos is cheap.Remember when everyone figured that Spotify was toast? The Swedish audio streaming service was making waves worldwide, but would it be able to succeed in the U.S. as Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Amazon Music flooded the market? It's doing pretty well, even if it had to go through three rounds of layoffs last year.There are 602 million mostly ad-supported monthly active users, a 23% increase over the past year. Getting folks to pay is the more difficult nut to crack, but Spotify has been beefing up its catalog of original content to go with its industry-leading music platform. Premium Spotify accounts have risen 15% over the past year to reach 236 million.Apple and Amazon are distant competitors. Google Play Music threw in the towel, handing its digital ambitions over to YouTube Music. It's going to be hard for the other streaming service stocks to catch up to Spotify now.Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners`"In this article, we discuss 10 best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners. Global stocks reached their highest point in over two years, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record high on February 7, as per Reuters. This was driven by robust earnings, which helped counter concerns surrounding US regional banks and the Chinese markets. Bonds experienced slight pressure, as statements from Federal Reserve officials reinforced the expectation that the central bank might not reduce interest rates in the near future. According to Arthur Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth: ""We are at the midpoint of the 4Q earnings reporting season, and we would say that there has been more good news than bad.""In 2023, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 26.29%, recovering from the setback of 18.11% in 2022. In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts. The potential combination of declining interest rates and earnings growth is seen as a positive for stocks. However, analysts express worries about overvalued technology sector stocks, and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to introduce significant market volatility.Looking at historical data from 1921 to 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research, noted that the average S&P 500 bull market has yielded a return of 157% and lasted over four years. This historical pattern suggests the possibility of the stock market rally continuing in the foreseeable future. One notable success in the current bull market has been the performance of artificial intelligence technology as an investment theme. AI stocks were among the top performers in 2023, contributing to the market's overall positive trajectory. James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, commented: “The market’s recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI.” On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee suggests a more cautious outlook for 2024, anticipating an average year for markets rather than double-digit gains. Concerns include the S&P 500's elevated forward price/earnings ratio and a historically low equity risk premium. Valuations indicate potential sub-par annual stock returns, with estimates pointing to a 4% gain compared to the long-run average of 7%-8%. Analysts' optimistic projections for 2024 U.S. corporate earnings are questioned, with expectations of a tapering in economic growth from 7% to 4%. The market's assumption of a more aggressive Fed rate-cutting stance contrasts with public signals, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions as emergency programs wind down in 2024.Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, remarked: “As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.” Some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology For this list, we used a stock screener and selected stable companies with high single digit or low-teens revenue growth. Then, we arranged them via market cap to get the largest companies. We selected the top stocks for beginners based on revenue growth and hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter of 2023. The list is sorted in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders. Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Quarterly Revenue Growth: 14.10%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company in the United States with four segments – UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. UnitedHealthcare offers health benefit plans for employers and individuals, Medicaid plans, and children's health insurance.On January 12, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $6.16 and a revenue of $94.4 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.17 and $2.22 billion, respectively. Revenue for the period increased 14% on a year-over-year basis. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 104 hedge funds held stakes worth nearly $11 billion in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared to 111 funds in the prior quarter worth $10.1 billion. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.2 million shares worth $1.6 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best cheap stocks for beginners. Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) contributed less to portfolio performance than the majority of our holdings during the quarter. The Company reported double-digit revenue, operating earnings and earnings per share growth during their third quarter. The Company has been able to adjust pricing in its health care segment to keep up with medical cost inflation while working with its Optum units to deliver more value-based care that replaces the traditional fee for service health care model. Value-based care is a sensible, long-term growth opportunity for the Company to pursue and also differentiates it from the vast majority of healthcare providers, particularly as it relates to Medicare patients. For example, the Company’s value-based care programs provide more preventative care opportunities and home-based care visits for patients which helps save the U.S. healthcare system billions in unnecessary spending while also providing patients with better outcomes, as diseases and behaviors are caught or corrected at earlier stages. The Company has invested in several core assets over many years to execute this value-based strategy and it will become the standard of care as the proportion of people in the U.S. with healthcare insurance coverage continues to reach new highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.00%JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a global financial services company operating in four segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management. It is one of the top cheap beginner stocks to watch. On February 6, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced that it intends to initiate a substantial expansion over the next three years, involving the commencement of 500 new branches, renovation of 1,700 locations, and the hiring of 3,500 staff members. The expansion will focus on reaching low-income and rural communities in new markets. Upon completion, this initiative will result in over 1,100 added branches and more than 10,500 new hires in its Consumer Bank team since 2018. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 109 hedge funds were long JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), compared to 106 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 11.3 million shares worth $1.65 billion. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We updated the sustainable scorecard for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). JP Morgan continues to have an Average rating across Governance, Social and Environmental factors. JP Morgan is using its business to improve climate change. JP Morgan has targeted $2.5 trillion in financing between 2021 and 2030 to advance long-term solutions to address climate change and sustainable development. The Board has oversight of corporate responsibility and ESG matters, but ESG and Sustainability are addressed across the firm. JPM does listen to shareholders. After a 31% For Vote on executive compensation in 2022, the Board will not be granting any special awards to Jamie Dimon or Daniel Pinto and if awarded to other Named Executive Officers, there will be a direct performance condition associated with the award. The Compensation Committee limited the cash percentage of Dimon and Pinto’s compensation.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Quarterly Revenue Growth: 10.20%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, and other products for data centers, gaming, and embedded applications. It is one of the best cheap beginner stocks to invest in. On February 1, Citi analyst Christopher Danely observed that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, anticipating $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi suggested that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) may intentionally be underestimating, and the company's CEO expressed confidence in surpassing the $3.5 billion figure for this year. The analyst estimated that AMD could generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from its MI300, according to buy-side investors' expectations.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion. White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.60%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), a diversified software company, operates globally through three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. The Digital Media segment offers products and services for content creation and promotion, including the flagship product Creative Cloud. The Digital Experience segment provides a platform for brands and businesses to manage and optimize customer experiences. The Publishing and Advertising segment offers various products and services, such as e-learning solutions and Advertising Cloud offerings. On December 13, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $4.27 and a revenue of $5.05 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.13 and $30 million, respectively. The company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares during the fourth quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.30%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a global provider of customer relationship management technology, facilitating the connection between companies and customers. The company's services include sales tools for data management, lead monitoring, progress tracking, and analytics. Salesforce also offers a platform allowing businesses to build custom apps, an online learning platform, and Slack for collaboration. On January 30, BofA designated Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) as one of their top picks for 2024. According to BofA Analyst Brad Sills, Salesforce is strategically positioned to further gain market share in the cumulative $200 billion market. Sills highlighted Salesforce's competitive advantage with a significant market share of only 15% and a robust moat derived from its extensive installed base of over 150,000 customers in the core sales/front office category.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 122 hedge funds were bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), same as the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with roughly 15 million shares worth $4 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) ranks 6th on our list of the top cheap stocks for beginners in 2024. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners.  Suggested articles:Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks15 Best Bitcoin Wallets For iPhone and Android11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 01:01:08.431927`AMZN
Do Not Fight this Market: 3 Top Ranked Stock to Join the Rally`After such a strong finish in 2023 and follow through at the start of 2024, investors are wondering when the correction is coming. While it is natural to expect some sort of pull-back I think investors would be best off not trying to predict, and instead continue buying top-ranked stocks.Below we can see the Nasdaq 100 is breaking out of this bullish looking consolidation, and the S&P 500 is very nearly pushing through the 5,000 level.Image Source: TradingViewFurthermore, there are many powerful investment themes keeping the markets bid, including a robust economy, exciting technological developments, and tremendous government spending deficits. That last item is definitely worth considering when wondering when the economy is going to slowdown.Because of the massive spending behind the most recent infrastructure bill, where more than $1 trillion is going to be spent, many laid off workers are likely to be soaked up by the public sector, and spending to continue.Based on these influential economic developments, investors should focus on continuing to buy leading stocks with top Zacks ranks, because a major economic slowdown is becoming less and less likely.Here I will share three stocks with top Zacks ranks, and market beating performance over the last month. I particularly like to look for stocks showing relative strength while the market continues to grind higher.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMercadoLibreMercadoLibre MELI, is the Latin-American version of Amazon, building an e-commerce platform that continues to boom in popularity. MercadoLibre has been one of the most exciting stocks in the last few years and its returns continue to delight investors willing to own shares.In addition to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, the company is forecasting impressive growth in sales and earnings.This year, sales are expected to climb 36% YoY to $14.3 billion, while EPS are set to expand 134% to $22.30 per share. That growth is projected to continue on to the next year as well, with sales expected to grow 22.3% the following year, and EPS to increase 57.6%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to the fundamental developments in MercadoLibre, its technical advances are compelling as well. In addition to relative strength against the market, it has been forming a very nice technical trade pattern to measure a breakout trade from.For investors waiting for a technical signal to enter MELI, a move above $1764 would market a clean breakout from this bullish consolidation.Image Source: TradingViewStoneCoStoneCo STNE is a Brazilian financial technology company specializing in payment processing solutions. Founded in 2012, StoneCo provides a range of services, including electronic payments, credit card processing, and point-of-sale technology for businesses of varying sizes.StoneCo has seen earnings estimates steadily trend higher over the last 10 months, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Additionally, the company is entering a period where EPS are expected to expand significantly. Earnings are forecast to grow 167% YoY this year, and 36.1% next year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MercadoLibre, StoneCo stock is forming a convincing technical pattern. STNE stock was hit hard at the end of 2022 and traded sideways at a depressed level for nearly two years.However, at the end of 2023, the stock initiated a stage one breakout, indicating investors had been buying the depressed stock. Now over the last two months, STNE price action has built out a weekly bull flag, leading me to believe another big breakout is coming.If STNE stock trades above the $18.50 level, investors could rush in to buy the stock sending it significantly higher.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon.comFinally, one of the world's leading companies, Amazon AMZN just reported an incredibly strong quarter of financials sending the stock much higher.Following the earnings gap up, Amazon stock is forming a post earnings consolidation, a very high probability trading setup. Above $171 and AMZN should make a run at its all-time high.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon has also been garnering interest from analysts, who have been steadily upgrading earnings estimates. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 22% and current quarter earnings by 12.5%.Earnings at the e-commerce and technology giant are expected to grow by an impressive 28.1% annually over the next 3-5 years, driven by its AWS and new advertising business segments.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe great thing about investing in stocks is that the best ones offer tremendous asymmetric opportunities. There is no reason to try and predict market selloffs, because so long as you focus on buying top-tier securities, the returns take care of themselves. That is not to say that risk management isn’t key, but good investors are often optimists. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Down 61% in the Past Year, Has This E-Commerce Stock Entered Bargain Territory?`The last 12 months were a good period in general for e-commerce stocks. Companies like Amazon, Shopify, MercadoLibre, and Pinduoduo saw their share prices rise at least 30%.But the industry had its laggards too, including JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), which saw its shares fall 61% in the past year. With the stock now down 78% from its all-time high, JD.com has attracted some investors looking to take advantage of a potential bargain.But before you rush into the stock, you should understand how JD.com got here in the first place. Only then can you make an informed investment decision.JD.com is one of the more successful companies replicating Amazon's playbook.The e-commerce giant operates a first-party e-commerce business in China by selling a wide range of products directly to customers. It also operates a third-party marketplace that allows other sellers on its platform, in exchange for fees from each successful transaction.The company emphasizes low prices to encourage customers to buy more over time, and it operates a complex logistics service to offer speedy deliveries. The low prices and fast delivery leads to strong customer retention and sales growth, providing JD.com with the scale needed to drive prices even lower and continuously improve its service.Customers love the approach, which explains the company's uninterrupted growth for many years. For perspective, revenue grew revenue at a compound annual rate of 27% from 2017 to 2021. Everything seemed to be moving in the right direction until recently.Investors accustomed to such an impressive track record were disappointed when the e-commerce company reported just 10% revenue growth in 2022. Subsequent months were even more challenging for the company with revenue growth declining to just 2% in Q3 2023. Revenue from its flagship first-party e-commerce business actually fell 1% year over year, masked by a 13% increase in service revenue.To add salt to the wound, competitor PDD Holdings reported 94% top-line growth in the same quarter. Even Alibaba, which is facing its own challenges, reported 9% growth.JD.com is failing to keep up with the competition. It didn't help that previous CEO Xu Lei stepped down from his post in May 2023 after just one year, adding another layer of uncertainty to the company's future.The silver lining here is the fact the company is still profitable with a strong balance sheet. JD.com generated 39 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in free cash flow in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2023. It also had 242 billion yuan ($33.2 billion) in cash and short-term investments. With this solid financial position, JD.com can continue to invest in areas like live-streaming shopping, supply chain improvements, and other initiatives.Still, investors should be aware the path ahead remains challenging as it will have to outmaneuver rivals like Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and Douyin.So JD.com is at a crossroads. Despite its previous success, the future is far less certain now that it faces a more competitive industry and greater regulatory scrutiny.Given the recent bearish sentiment, JD.com stock trades at a significant discount to other e-commerce companies with a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is just 10.2, while Pinduoduo trades at 27.8 times earnings.Investors should monitor JD.com's rebound efforts in the coming quarters for clues of its progress. If the company can defend its position as a top three e-commerce platform in China and rekindle growth, its current stock price should prove to be a bargain.Should you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?Before you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JD.com wasn’t one of them.

3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now`"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is off to a great start in 2024. The e-commerce giant is making progress along all fronts of its multifaceted business, and its stock is up 66% over the past year.You might not realize that it's still trading below all-time highs. But the way things are going, Amazon stock is likely to surpass that in the coming months, and now is a great time to buy it.Here are three specific reasons to be confident about Amazon stock this year.Amazon made a strategic decision last year to restructure its distribution network from a national one to a regional one. The rationale was that the national network was large and cumbersome, making it take longer, on average, to get products to customers. A regional network stocked with high-selling items would get products to customers faster and at a lower cost.It now has eight regional distribution centers, and the results speak for themselves. In the 2023 fourth quarter, Amazon delivered 65% more items overnight than in the prior year. CEO Andy Jassy noted that as Amazon fulfills orders faster, customers choose it for more orders.In a first since 2018, Amazon has decreased its per-unit cost to fulfill globally, and in the U.S., fulfillment cost per unit decreased by more than $0.45 from last year. This allows Amazon to expand its selection profitably at lower average selling prices, improving its chances of gaining market share.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud services arm. Until recently, AWS sales were reliable to grow at rates around 35% in a typical quarter. That began to drop when inflation became severe, and client businesses started to cut their budgets.However, Amazon continues to lead the industry with 32% of the overall market according to Statista, and sales growth improved in the fourth quarter to 13% year over year. Jassy said the company is seeing larger deals accelerate; it announced several new deals with companies like Salesforce, BMW, and Nvidia.The company launched a robust suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services for AWS, and adoption rates are strong. The company offers three layers of AI to meet the varied needs of its clients, from the most customizable to partially customizable, with the top layer being a generative AI ""coded companion."" Last week, Amazon launched Rufus, a personal shopping generative AI application that takes customer queries and offers product recommendations based on requirements.Jassy said Amazon will continue to invest heavily in AI since it offers the opportunity to revolutionize the shopping and processing experience for its customers, and it sees this as a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years.Amazon only started to break out advertising as its own business segment in late 2021, when it grew 32% year over year, trailing AWS at 40%. With the other businesses slowing down, advertising has become the fastest-growing reporting segment, increasing 26% over last year in the 2023 fourth quarter. That was driven by sponsored ads.Advertising is a no-brainer for Amazon third-party sellers since it exposes them to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers. Amazon's top AI helps them target potential buyers with high accuracy.Amazon recently changed its streaming program to an ad-supported track, like Netflix and Walt Disney, which should pump up this segment even more. This will likely remain a strong business for Amazon in the near term, and as advertisers revisit their budgets after inflation-induced cuts, they're liable to spend more. Some percentage of that will go to Amazon.These are only part of the story. Amazon is making strides in smaller endeavors like cashierless stores, healthcare, and more. 2024 could be a banner year for Amazon, and in the long term, it's likely to add value to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks`"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 5 Stocks.Jim Cramer said in a latest program that after listening to the Fed chair Jerome Powell he believes we are at ""crossroads"" since there is still ""some inflation"" and the ""dichotomy"" of hard landing versus soft landing is being ""replaced by no landing."" Cramer said that we are ""back to reality"" and the reality, according to Cramer, is that interest rates are still ""not that high."" Cramer believes the rates are at a level where the economy can keep working. Cramer wondered how and why the Fed would cut interest rates when strong employment numbers keep coming and inflation is also not going down significantly.Jim Cramer tried to convince his viewers to invest in the stock market and said that while it would seem ""reckless"" to invest in the stock market because of the risks involved, it would be ""too late"" to invest in stocks once the Fed begins to cut interest rates. Jim Cramer said that stocks are in a win-win situation. If the economy keeps growing and the market remains strong, stocks will go up. If the economy begins to slow down, the Fed would cut rates sometime in the future, causing a rally in the stock market. Jim Cramer, however, acknowledged that stocks are risky when compared to the steady 5% income on CDs.Cramer said ""great"" stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can give you that ""5% from CDs"" in ""a week or even a day.""Cramer said that he has ""no illusions"" and he is convinced that now is the right time to buy stocks. Cramer said he thinks many investors would be inclined towards investing in low-risk index funds or parking their cash in CDs or treasuries but he thinks big money will be made by investing in individual stocks.But Jim Cramer is not bullish on all stocks. In fact over the past couple of years or so he's become quite selective in his choices and keeps recommending investors to sell or stay away from low-quality, money-losing or risky stocks and instead buy best of breed and high quality stocks.In this article we will talk about some stocks Cramer is bearish on.MethodologyFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to either stay away from or sell. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment where available. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/ASports and outdoor equipment company Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) recently went public in an IPO that fell short of expectations. Cramer had advised investors to stay away from the stock. He said:“So far, this is looking like another out of favor IPO, even if its lowball price allowed the stock to get a like, I guess you could call it a decent pop. And, I’ve got to tell you, Amer Sports is a great example of the kind of deals I wish we weren’t seeing.”One of the reasons why Cramer is bearish on Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) is the company's high exposure to China.While Cramer is bearish on the stock, Canadian billionaire Chip Wilson, who also founded Lululemon Athletica, bought $324 million worth of shares at the company’s IPO.While Cramer is bearish on companies like Amer Sports, he's recommending buying high-quality mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 9Last month, Jim Cramer was asked about Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC). Cramer recommended the questioner to ""take a pass"" on the stock. Cramer said the ""greatest inventor of our time"" Elon Musk does not like lithium companies and he is trying to figure out a way to cut our dependence on them. Cramer said he would not go against Musk.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Surgical facilities company Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on these days. When asked about Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) in a recent program on CNBC, Cramer said ""that industry is in up and down right now.""""I'm taking a hard pass,"" Cramer said of Surgery Partners.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The biggest stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is owned by Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $157 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22Jim Cramer in a recent program said he hasn’t ""liked Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) in 20 years, and it’s really rewarded my dislike.""Cramer said instead of Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) he's ""willing"" to recommend Verizon.Insider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 22 hedge funds had stakes in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD). The biggest stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) is owned by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP which owns a $37 million stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24Gene editing platform company CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) ranks sixth in our list of stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from.While Cramer said that he ""likes"" CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), the reason why he cannot recommend the stock is that CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) has been losing a lot of money. Cramer said he cannot recommend CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) stock on a ""fundamental basis.""The stock has gained about 17% over the past one year. Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) said the US FDA approved its groundbreaking gene editing therapy, Casgevy, developed with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) for those aged 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT).Unlike Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Cramer likes a lot, the CNBC host is bearish on CRSP.

3 Inspiring Underdogs That Fought Tech Giants and Won`"When it comes to success in emerging industries, size usually matters. Pioneers often fail, leaving behind the foundation for larger players to dominate. Thankfully for investors in mold-breaking upstarts, it doesn't always play out that way.Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Sonos (NASDAQ: SONO), and Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) are three companies that saw Apple and other consumer tech behemoths try to take them out. The little guys are not just surviving, but thriving against established titans with almost limitless resources. Take a bow Roku, Sonos, and Spotify.Roku founder Anthony Wood invented the digital video recorder, but it was another company that enjoyed the DVR glory. He got it right when he launched Roku a few years later, pioneering the streaming video revolution. It wasn't long before Roku was joined by some of the most valuable companies on the planet. Apple TV, Alphabet's Google Chromecast, and Amazon's Fire TV hit the market. Roku didn't flinch.Roku remains the leading operating system for smart TVs in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It has roughly double the market share of its closest rival. It doesn't matter that Google and Amazon are willing to practically give away the hardware to get folks connected. Roku has been able to sacrifice product margins, knowing it can make it up in volume.Roku is free to use, making the lion's share of its revenue from ad sharing and referrals. It's working. Average revenue per user is more than $41 over the past year. There are 75.8 million active accounts on the platform, and boy are they active. Roku users are spending an average of 3.8 hours a day streaming through the Roku hub.It doesn't seem possible. Roku is competing against Apple, a company that is used to getting people to pay a premium for its wares. Alphabet is the global leader in online advertising, putting it in the perfect position to cash in on an ad-supported industry. Amazon is the top dog in online retail, and it aggressively promotes its Fire TV dongles and smart TVs on its platform. Roku is still beating them all.Roku's enemies are also rivals of Sonos. It was 2005 when Sonos rolled out the first wireless multiroom speaker system, which streams audio seamlessly through a home. Audiophiles flocked to Sonos, but then familiar foes emerged. Apple, Amazon, and Google all had cheap smart speakers in support of their virtual assistant technologies. Sonos was in their crosshairs if they chose to go upmarket, but they missed.Sonos would go on to deliver 17 consecutive years of revenue growth before proving mortal in fiscal 2023. On Tuesday afternoon it posted financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. It was a well-received report.Revenue declined 9%, or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. It's not pretty, but analysts were bracing for a 13% decline. The bigger surprise is at the other end of the income statement. Profitability improved at Sonos, earning $0.64 a share for the seasonally potent holiday quarter, up from $0.57 a share a year earlier. Wall Street pros were settling for a sharp decline to $0.39 a share.""Despite the challenging environment, we are winning in the market and outperforming the competition,"" CEO Patrick Spence said in this week's earnings report.Rich in cash and patents, Sonos is well positioned to continue dominating its high-end niche. With analyst profit targets now likely headed higher, Sonos is cheap.Remember when everyone figured that Spotify was toast? The Swedish audio streaming service was making waves worldwide, but would it be able to succeed in the U.S. as Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Amazon Music flooded the market? It's doing pretty well, even if it had to go through three rounds of layoffs last year.There are 602 million mostly ad-supported monthly active users, a 23% increase over the past year. Getting folks to pay is the more difficult nut to crack, but Spotify has been beefing up its catalog of original content to go with its industry-leading music platform. Premium Spotify accounts have risen 15% over the past year to reach 236 million.Apple and Amazon are distant competitors. Google Play Music threw in the towel, handing its digital ambitions over to YouTube Music. It's going to be hard for the other streaming service stocks to catch up to Spotify now.Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far`"Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners`"In this article, we discuss 10 best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners. Global stocks reached their highest point in over two years, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record high on February 7, as per Reuters. This was driven by robust earnings, which helped counter concerns surrounding US regional banks and the Chinese markets. Bonds experienced slight pressure, as statements from Federal Reserve officials reinforced the expectation that the central bank might not reduce interest rates in the near future. According to Arthur Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth: ""We are at the midpoint of the 4Q earnings reporting season, and we would say that there has been more good news than bad.""In 2023, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 26.29%, recovering from the setback of 18.11% in 2022. In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts. The potential combination of declining interest rates and earnings growth is seen as a positive for stocks. However, analysts express worries about overvalued technology sector stocks, and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to introduce significant market volatility.Looking at historical data from 1921 to 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research, noted that the average S&P 500 bull market has yielded a return of 157% and lasted over four years. This historical pattern suggests the possibility of the stock market rally continuing in the foreseeable future. One notable success in the current bull market has been the performance of artificial intelligence technology as an investment theme. AI stocks were among the top performers in 2023, contributing to the market's overall positive trajectory. James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, commented: “The market’s recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI.” On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee suggests a more cautious outlook for 2024, anticipating an average year for markets rather than double-digit gains. Concerns include the S&P 500's elevated forward price/earnings ratio and a historically low equity risk premium. Valuations indicate potential sub-par annual stock returns, with estimates pointing to a 4% gain compared to the long-run average of 7%-8%. Analysts' optimistic projections for 2024 U.S. corporate earnings are questioned, with expectations of a tapering in economic growth from 7% to 4%. The market's assumption of a more aggressive Fed rate-cutting stance contrasts with public signals, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions as emergency programs wind down in 2024.Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, remarked: “As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.” Some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology For this list, we used a stock screener and selected stable companies with high single digit or low-teens revenue growth. Then, we arranged them via market cap to get the largest companies. We selected the top stocks for beginners based on revenue growth and hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter of 2023.

The Company has been able to adjust pricing in its health care segment to keep up with medical cost inflation while working with its Optum units to deliver more value-based care that replaces the traditional fee for service health care model. Value-based care is a sensible, long-term growth opportunity for the Company to pursue and also differentiates it from the vast majority of healthcare providers, particularly as it relates to Medicare patients. For example, the Company’s value-based care programs provide more preventative care opportunities and home-based care visits for patients which helps save the U.S. healthcare system billions in unnecessary spending while also providing patients with better outcomes, as diseases and behaviors are caught or corrected at earlier stages. The Company has invested in several core assets over many years to execute this value-based strategy and it will become the standard of care as the proportion of people in the U.S. with healthcare insurance coverage continues to reach new highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.00%JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, and other products for data centers, gaming, and embedded applications. It is one of the best cheap beginner stocks to invest in. On February 1, Citi analyst Christopher Danely observed that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, anticipating $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi suggested that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) may intentionally be underestimating, and the company's CEO expressed confidence in surpassing the $3.5 billion figure for this year. The analyst estimated that AMD could generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from its MI300, according to buy-side investors' expectations.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.60%Adobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Quarterly Revenue Growth: 11.30%Salesforce, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) ranks 6th on our list of the top cheap stocks for beginners in 2024. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.” Click to continue reading and 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners.  Suggested articles:Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks15 Best Bitcoin Wallets For iPhone and Android11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners is originally published on Insider Monkey.Related Quotes"`2024-02-08 01:03:45.226348`AMZN
Do Not Fight this Market: 3 Top Ranked Stock to Join the Rally`After such a strong finish in 2023 and follow through at the start of 2024, investors are wondering when the correction is coming. While it is natural to expect some sort of pull-back I think investors would be best off not trying to predict, and instead continue buying top-ranked stocks.Below we can see the Nasdaq 100 is breaking out of this bullish looking consolidation, and the S&P 500 is very nearly pushing through the 5,000 level.Image Source: TradingViewFurthermore, there are many powerful investment themes keeping the markets bid, including a robust economy, exciting technological developments, and tremendous government spending deficits. That last item is definitely worth considering when wondering when the economy is going to slowdown.Because of the massive spending behind the most recent infrastructure bill, where more than $1 trillion is going to be spent, many laid off workers are likely to be soaked up by the public sector, and spending to continue.Based on these influential economic developments, investors should focus on continuing to buy leading stocks with top Zacks ranks, because a major economic slowdown is becoming less and less likely.Here I will share three stocks with top Zacks ranks, and market beating performance over the last month. I particularly like to look for stocks showing relative strength while the market continues to grind higher.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMercadoLibreMercadoLibre MELI, is the Latin-American version of Amazon, building an e-commerce platform that continues to boom in popularity. MercadoLibre has been one of the most exciting stocks in the last few years and its returns continue to delight investors willing to own shares.In addition to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, the company is forecasting impressive growth in sales and earnings.This year, sales are expected to climb 36% YoY to $14.3 billion, while EPS are set to expand 134% to $22.30 per share. That growth is projected to continue on to the next year as well, with sales expected to grow 22.3% the following year, and EPS to increase 57.6%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to the fundamental developments in MercadoLibre, its technical advances are compelling as well. In addition to relative strength against the market, it has been forming a very nice technical trade pattern to measure a breakout trade from.For investors waiting for a technical signal to enter MELI, a move above $1764 would market a clean breakout from this bullish consolidation.Image Source: TradingViewStoneCoStoneCo STNE is a Brazilian financial technology company specializing in payment processing solutions. Founded in 2012, StoneCo provides a range of services, including electronic payments, credit card processing, and point-of-sale technology for businesses of varying sizes.StoneCo has seen earnings estimates steadily trend higher over the last 10 months, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Additionally, the company is entering a period where EPS are expected to expand significantly. Earnings are forecast to grow 167% YoY this year, and 36.1% next year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MercadoLibre, StoneCo stock is forming a convincing technical pattern. STNE stock was hit hard at the end of 2022 and traded sideways at a depressed level for nearly two years.However, at the end of 2023, the stock initiated a stage one breakout, indicating investors had been buying the depressed stock. Now over the last two months, STNE price action has built out a weekly bull flag, leading me to believe another big breakout is coming.If STNE stock trades above the $18.50 level, investors could rush in to buy the stock sending it significantly higher.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon.comFinally, one of the world's leading companies, Amazon AMZN just reported an incredibly strong quarter of financials sending the stock much higher.Following the earnings gap up, Amazon stock is forming a post earnings consolidation, a very high probability trading setup. Above $171 and AMZN should make a run at its all-time high.Image Source: TradingViewAmazon has also been garnering interest from analysts, who have been steadily upgrading earnings estimates. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 22% and current quarter earnings by 12.5%.Earnings at the e-commerce and technology giant are expected to grow by an impressive 28.1% annually over the next 3-5 years, driven by its AWS and new advertising business segments.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe great thing about investing in stocks is that the best ones offer tremendous asymmetric opportunities. There is no reason to try and predict market selloffs, because so long as you focus on buying top-tier securities, the returns take care of themselves. That is not to say that risk management isn’t key, but good investors are often optimists. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Down 61% in the Past Year, Has This E-Commerce Stock Entered Bargain Territory?`The last 12 months were a good period in general for e-commerce stocks. Companies like Amazon, Shopify, MercadoLibre, and Pinduoduo saw their share prices rise at least 30%.But the industry had its laggards too, including JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), which saw its shares fall 61% in the past year. With the stock now down 78% from its all-time high, JD.com has attracted some investors looking to take advantage of a potential bargain.But before you rush into the stock, you should understand how JD.com got here in the first place. Only then can you make an informed investment decision.JD.com is one of the more successful companies replicating Amazon's playbook.The e-commerce giant operates a first-party e-commerce business in China by selling a wide range of products directly to customers. It also operates a third-party marketplace that allows other sellers on its platform, in exchange for fees from each successful transaction.The company emphasizes low prices to encourage customers to buy more over time, and it operates a complex logistics service to offer speedy deliveries. The low prices and fast delivery leads to strong customer retention and sales growth, providing JD.com with the scale needed to drive prices even lower and continuously improve its service.Customers love the approach, which explains the company's uninterrupted growth for many years. For perspective, revenue grew revenue at a compound annual rate of 27% from 2017 to 2021. Everything seemed to be moving in the right direction until recently.Investors accustomed to such an impressive track record were disappointed when the e-commerce company reported just 10% revenue growth in 2022. Subsequent months were even more challenging for the company with revenue growth declining to just 2% in Q3 2023. Revenue from its flagship first-party e-commerce business actually fell 1% year over year, masked by a 13% increase in service revenue.To add salt to the wound, competitor PDD Holdings reported 94% top-line growth in the same quarter. Even Alibaba, which is facing its own challenges, reported 9% growth.JD.com is failing to keep up with the competition. It didn't help that previous CEO Xu Lei stepped down from his post in May 2023 after just one year, adding another layer of uncertainty to the company's future.The silver lining here is the fact the company is still profitable with a strong balance sheet. JD.com generated 39 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in free cash flow in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2023. It also had 242 billion yuan ($33.2 billion) in cash and short-term investments. With this solid financial position, JD.com can continue to invest in areas like live-streaming shopping, supply chain improvements, and other initiatives.Still, investors should be aware the path ahead remains challenging as it will have to outmaneuver rivals like Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and Douyin.So JD.com is at a crossroads. Despite its previous success, the future is far less certain now that it faces a more competitive industry and greater regulatory scrutiny.Given the recent bearish sentiment, JD.com stock trades at a significant discount to other e-commerce companies with a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is just 10.2, while Pinduoduo trades at 27.8 times earnings.Investors should monitor JD.com's rebound efforts in the coming quarters for clues of its progress. If the company can defend its position as a top three e-commerce platform in China and rekindle growth, its current stock price should prove to be a bargain.Should you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?Before you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JD.com wasn’t one of them.

3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now`"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is off to a great start in 2024. The e-commerce giant is making progress along all fronts of its multifaceted business, and its stock is up 66% over the past year.You might not realize that it's still trading below all-time highs. But the way things are going, Amazon stock is likely to surpass that in the coming months, and now is a great time to buy it.Here are three specific reasons to be confident about Amazon stock this year.Amazon made a strategic decision last year to restructure its distribution network from a national one to a regional one. The rationale was that the national network was large and cumbersome, making it take longer, on average, to get products to customers. A regional network stocked with high-selling items would get products to customers faster and at a lower cost.It now has eight regional distribution centers, and the results speak for themselves. In the 2023 fourth quarter, Amazon delivered 65% more items overnight than in the prior year. CEO Andy Jassy noted that as Amazon fulfills orders faster, customers choose it for more orders.In a first since 2018, Amazon has decreased its per-unit cost to fulfill globally, and in the U.S., fulfillment cost per unit decreased by more than $0.45 from last year. This allows Amazon to expand its selection profitably at lower average selling prices, improving its chances of gaining market share.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud services arm. Until recently, AWS sales were reliable to grow at rates around 35% in a typical quarter. That began to drop when inflation became severe, and client businesses started to cut their budgets.However, Amazon continues to lead the industry with 32% of the overall market according to Statista, and sales growth improved in the fourth quarter to 13% year over year. Jassy said the company is seeing larger deals accelerate; it announced several new deals with companies like Salesforce, BMW, and Nvidia.The company launched a robust suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services for AWS, and adoption rates are strong. The company offers three layers of AI to meet the varied needs of its clients, from the most customizable to partially customizable, with the top layer being a generative AI ""coded companion."" Last week, Amazon launched Rufus, a personal shopping generative AI application that takes customer queries and offers product recommendations based on requirements.Jassy said Amazon will continue to invest heavily in AI since it offers the opportunity to revolutionize the shopping and processing experience for its customers, and it sees this as a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years.Amazon only started to break out advertising as its own business segment in late 2021, when it grew 32% year over year, trailing AWS at 40%. With the other businesses slowing down, advertising has become the fastest-growing reporting segment, increasing 26% over last year in the 2023 fourth quarter. That was driven by sponsored ads.Advertising is a no-brainer for Amazon third-party sellers since it exposes them to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers. Amazon's top AI helps them target potential buyers with high accuracy.Amazon recently changed its streaming program to an ad-supported track, like Netflix and Walt Disney, which should pump up this segment even more. This will likely remain a strong business for Amazon in the near term, and as advertisers revisit their budgets after inflation-induced cuts, they're liable to spend more. Some percentage of that will go to Amazon.These are only part of the story. Amazon is making strides in smaller endeavors like cashierless stores, healthcare, and more. 2024 could be a banner year for Amazon, and in the long term, it's likely to add value to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks`"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 5 Stocks.Jim Cramer said in a latest program that after listening to the Fed chair Jerome Powell he believes we are at ""crossroads"" since there is still ""some inflation"" and the ""dichotomy"" of hard landing versus soft landing is being ""replaced by no landing."" Cramer said that we are ""back to reality"" and the reality, according to Cramer, is that interest rates are still ""not that high."" Cramer believes the rates are at a level where the economy can keep working. Cramer wondered how and why the Fed would cut interest rates when strong employment numbers keep coming and inflation is also not going down significantly.Jim Cramer tried to convince his viewers to invest in the stock market and said that while it would seem ""reckless"" to invest in the stock market because of the risks involved, it would be ""too late"" to invest in stocks once the Fed begins to cut interest rates. Jim Cramer said that stocks are in a win-win situation. If the economy keeps growing and the market remains strong, stocks will go up. If the economy begins to slow down, the Fed would cut rates sometime in the future, causing a rally in the stock market. Jim Cramer, however, acknowledged that stocks are risky when compared to the steady 5% income on CDs.Cramer said ""great"" stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can give you that ""5% from CDs"" in ""a week or even a day.""Cramer said that he has ""no illusions"" and he is convinced that now is the right time to buy stocks. Cramer said he thinks many investors would be inclined towards investing in low-risk index funds or parking their cash in CDs or treasuries but he thinks big money will be made by investing in individual stocks.But Jim Cramer is not bullish on all stocks. In fact over the past couple of years or so he's become quite selective in his choices and keeps recommending investors to sell or stay away from low-quality, money-losing or risky stocks and instead buy best of breed and high quality stocks.In this article we will talk about some stocks Cramer is bearish on.MethodologyFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to either stay away from or sell. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment where available. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/ASports and outdoor equipment company Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) recently went public in an IPO that fell short of expectations. Cramer had advised investors to stay away from the stock. He said:“So far, this is looking like another out of favor IPO, even if its lowball price allowed the stock to get a like, I guess you could call it a decent pop. And, I’ve got to tell you, Amer Sports is a great example of the kind of deals I wish we weren’t seeing.”One of the reasons why Cramer is bearish on Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) is the company's high exposure to China.While Cramer is bearish on the stock, Canadian billionaire Chip Wilson, who also founded Lululemon Athletica, bought $324 million worth of shares at the company’s IPO.While Cramer is bearish on companies like Amer Sports, he's recommending buying high-quality mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 9Last month, Jim Cramer was asked about Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC). Cramer recommended the questioner to ""take a pass"" on the stock. Cramer said the ""greatest inventor of our time"" Elon Musk does not like lithium companies and he is trying to figure out a way to cut our dependence on them. Cramer said he would not go against Musk.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Surgical facilities company Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on these days. When asked about Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) in a recent program on CNBC, Cramer said ""that industry is in up and down right now.""""I'm taking a hard pass,"" Cramer said of Surgery Partners.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The biggest stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is owned by Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $157 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22Jim Cramer in a recent program said he hasn’t ""liked Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) in 20 years, and it’s really rewarded my dislike.""Cramer said instead of Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) he's ""willing"" to recommend Verizon.Insider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 22 hedge funds had stakes in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD). The biggest stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) is owned by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP which owns a $37 million stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24Gene editing platform company CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) ranks sixth in our list of stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from.While Cramer said that he ""likes"" CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), the reason why he cannot recommend the stock is that CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) has been losing a lot of money. Cramer said he cannot recommend CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) stock on a ""fundamental basis.""The stock has gained about 17% over the past one year. Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) said the US FDA approved its groundbreaking gene editing therapy, Casgevy, developed with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) for those aged 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT).Unlike Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Cramer likes a lot, the CNBC host is bearish on CRSP.

3 Inspiring Underdogs That Fought Tech Giants and Won`"When it comes to success in emerging industries, size usually matters. Pioneers often fail, leaving behind the foundation for larger players to dominate. Thankfully for investors in mold-breaking upstarts, it doesn't always play out that way.Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Sonos (NASDAQ: SONO), and Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) are three companies that saw Apple and other consumer tech behemoths try to take them out. The little guys are not just surviving, but thriving against established titans with almost limitless resources. Take a bow Roku, Sonos, and Spotify.Roku founder Anthony Wood invented the digital video recorder, but it was another company that enjoyed the DVR glory. He got it right when he launched Roku a few years later, pioneering the streaming video revolution. It wasn't long before Roku was joined by some of the most valuable companies on the planet. Apple TV, Alphabet's Google Chromecast, and Amazon's Fire TV hit the market. Roku didn't flinch.Roku remains the leading operating system for smart TVs in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It has roughly double the market share of its closest rival. It doesn't matter that Google and Amazon are willing to practically give away the hardware to get folks connected. Roku has been able to sacrifice product margins, knowing it can make it up in volume.Roku is free to use, making the lion's share of its revenue from ad sharing and referrals. It's working. Average revenue per user is more than $41 over the past year. There are 75.8 million active accounts on the platform, and boy are they active. Roku users are spending an average of 3.8 hours a day streaming through the Roku hub.It doesn't seem possible. Roku is competing against Apple, a company that is used to getting people to pay a premium for its wares. Alphabet is the global leader in online advertising, putting it in the perfect position to cash in on an ad-supported industry. Amazon is the top dog in online retail, and it aggressively promotes its Fire TV dongles and smart TVs on its platform. Roku is still beating them all.Roku's enemies are also rivals of Sonos. It was 2005 when Sonos rolled out the first wireless multiroom speaker system, which streams audio seamlessly through a home. Audiophiles flocked to Sonos, but then familiar foes emerged. Apple, Amazon, and Google all had cheap smart speakers in support of their virtual assistant technologies. Sonos was in their crosshairs if they chose to go upmarket, but they missed.Sonos would go on to deliver 17 consecutive years of revenue growth before proving mortal in fiscal 2023. On Tuesday afternoon it posted financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. It was a well-received report.Revenue declined 9%, or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. It's not pretty, but analysts were bracing for a 13% decline. The bigger surprise is at the other end of the income statement. Profitability improved at Sonos, earning $0.64 a share for the seasonally potent holiday quarter, up from $0.57 a share a year earlier. Wall Street pros were settling for a sharp decline to $0.39 a share.""Despite the challenging environment, we are winning in the market and outperforming the competition,"" CEO Patrick Spence said in this week's earnings report.Rich in cash and patents, Sonos is well positioned to continue dominating its high-end niche. With analyst profit targets now likely headed higher, Sonos is cheap.Remember when everyone figured that Spotify was toast? The Swedish audio streaming service was making waves worldwide, but would it be able to succeed in the U.S. as Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Amazon Music flooded the market? It's doing pretty well, even if it had to go through three rounds of layoffs last year.There are 602 million mostly ad-supported monthly active users, a 23% increase over the past year. Getting folks to pay is the more difficult nut to crack, but Spotify has been beefing up its catalog of original content to go with its industry-leading music platform. Premium Spotify accounts have risen 15% over the past year to reach 236 million.Apple and Amazon are distant competitors. Google Play Music threw in the towel, handing its digital ambitions over to YouTube Music. It's going to be hard for the other streaming service stocks to catch up to Spotify now.Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.
