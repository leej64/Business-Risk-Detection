This deal would have allowed Amazon to invest in continued innovation by iRobot and support iRobot in lowering prices on products customers already love. The companies released the following statements today about the decision:""We’re disappointed that Amazon’s acquisition of iRobot could not proceed,"" said David Zapolsky, Amazon SVP and General Counsel. ""We’re believers in the future of consumer robotics in the home and have always been fans of iRobot’s products, which delight consumers and solve problems in ways that improve their lives. Amazon and iRobot were excited to see what our teams could build together, and we’re deeply grateful to everyone who worked tirelessly to try and make this collaboration a reality. This outcome will deny consumers faster innovation and more competitive prices, which we’re confident would have made their lives easier and more enjoyable. Mergers and acquisitions like this help companies like iRobot better compete in the global marketplace, particularly against companies, and from countries, that aren’t subject to the same regulatory requirements in fast-moving technology segments like robotics. Undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles discourage entrepreneurs, who should be able to see acquisition as one path to success, and that hurts both consumers and competition—the very things that regulators say they’re trying to protect.""""iRobot is an innovation pioneer with a clear vision to make consumer robots a reality,"" said Colin Angle, Founder of iRobot. ""The termination of the agreement with Amazon is disappointing, but iRobot now turns toward the future with a focus and commitment to continue building thoughtful robots and intelligent home innovations that make life better, and that our customers around the world love.""The companies have signed a termination agreement that resolves all outstanding matters from the transaction, including Amazon paying iRobot the previously agreed upon termination fee.About AmazonAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

As a key initiative of the Council's MSD Solutions Lab, a groundbreaking strategic program established in 2021 with funding from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), a total of up to $535,000 has now been committed in grants to foster innovative, transferable methods to mitigate MSDs – the most common workplace injury – across a range of sectors and workplaces. ""Bringing together the brightest minds and pushing the boundaries of MSD prevention research and technology is at the heart of all we do,"" said Paul Vincent, NSC executive vice president of workplace practice. ""We're proud to bring back these grants for another year so we can expand our network of top innovators to solve this pervasive safety challenge, and ultimately help workers lead safer, healthier lives on and off the job.""""We are pleased to continue our partnership with NSC on the MSD Solutions Lab,"" said Sarah Rhoads, Vice President of Global Workplace Health and Safety at Amazon. ""The Research to Solutions and MSD Pilot Grant programs will advance research and create scalable MSD mitigation programs that help improve safety for employees on a global scale.""MSDs include tendinitis, back strains and sprains, as well as carpal tunnel syndrome, and are often caused by exposures to repetitive, forceful exertions like heavy lifting. They affect people in every industry and sector, and cost U.S. businesses in the private sector nearly $17 billion a year, according to the Liberty Mutual Workplace Safety Index. Recognizing the scope of these injuries, each grant is designed to further MSD prevention:Research to Solutions, which will award up to $50,000 per approved research project, for a total of $200,000 in grants, invites academic institutions, businesses and industries to innovate new solutions for MSDs, focusing on occupational injury risk reduction that can be seamlessly integrated across a range of sectors and workplaces. R2S proposals should support one or more key research areas, including emerging technologies, solutions to jobs or tasks known to have high MSD risk, MSD management systems, and total worker wellbeing.MSD Pilot Grant, which will award up to $20,000 per approved project, for a total of $60,000 in grants, aims to reduce MSDs caused by upper-extremity work by matching organizations with innovative technology providers to trial emerging technologies in real-life applications.

Recognizing the impact these injuries have on workers and businesses, the National Safety Council, with funding from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), established the groundbreaking MSD Solutions Lab in 2021 to solve workplace MSDs. As a hallmark initiative of the lab, the MSD Pledge was launched in June 2022 and many of the world's leading employers have joined the global effort to reduce this pervasive safety challenge. To help monitor progress along this journey of transforming workplace safety and improving the lives of millions of workers, NSC developed the MSD Solutions Index, an annual benchmarking survey, and today released the inaugural findings in the MSD Solutions Index Pledge Community Report.The MSD Solutions Index provides MSD Pledge members with individualized feedback on areas of success and opportunity for improvement related to their current MSD reduction efforts and to help identify broader industry trends impacting MSD prevention efforts. Developed in partnership with academic and industry experts, the index is also intended to hold organizations accountable to their three main pledge commitments of advancing MSD risk reduction, innovation and collaboration, and safety culture.""What gets measured gets managed, which is why collecting workplace data is critical to helping organizations mitigate MSDs,"" said Paul Vincent, executive vice president of workplace practice at NSC. ""Through the MSD Solutions Index, not only does it provide direct, tangible takeaways for each pledging organization, but it offers key insights that can be applied across industries to improve MSD prevention. Addressing the most common workplace injury on a global scale has never been done before and initiatives like this help our entire safety community be better positioned to create safer outcomes for millions of workers worldwide.""Starting in December 2022 and concluding in June 2023, 52 MSD Pledge members – representing the manufacturing, professional, transportation and warehousing, healthcare, utilities, and several other industries – completed the 46-question MSD Solutions Index survey. Organizations received an overall index result, as well as results for the three pledge commitment subsections, that fell into one of five results categories representing MSD prevention maturity: novice, reactive, advancing, proactive and innovating. Major insights from the MSD Solutions Index included:No organization earned a perfect score on the MSD Solutions Index, underscoring the complexity of MSDs and their prevention. However, 85% of organizations received overall results in the advancing (39%) or proactive (46%) categories, while 15% were in the reactive category. Further, 54% rated their workplace's ability to prevent MSDs as either very good or excellent.For the three subsections:Risk Reduction: 44% of organizations received a result of advancing.Safety Culture: Respondents showed slightly higher average scores, with 42% in the proactive category.Innovation and collaboration: Overall results demonstrated slightly lower average scores, with 31% scoring as reactive, though more than half of organizations exhibited advancing, proactive or innovating results.Larger organizations, which have more than 1,000 employees, are generally more effective at mitigating MSD risk, as they are more likely to have mature, long-standing safety programs and resources to adopt more complex MSD solutions and technology. In contrast, the majority of small to medium sized businesses established their safety program in the last five years.Eight in 10 pledge members have some form of MSD prevention or ergonomics program in place, and 65% have methods for tracking MSD rates across their workplace.Nearly two-thirds of organizations regularly conduct employee perception surveys, and nearly 90% have methods in place for workers to share suggestions for safety improvements. Notably, the MSD Solutions Index showed that when it comes to safety decisions related to workstation design, employees' physical work environment and workflow, frontline workers are regularly consulted on these issues, which leads to stronger safety cultures. However, while larger organizations are more likely to administer employee perception surveys, they saw lower levels of trust and frontline worker involvement in decision making.Nearly 85% of organizations reported that psychosocial risk factors contribute to MSDs in their workplace. These risk factors include things like mental health, fatigue, lack of tracking, and lack of personnel and proper equipment or tools.More than 80% of pledging members that completed the MSD Solutions Index are currently using technology in their workplace to prevent MSDs and just as many are effective at ensuring these best practices are broadcast widely across their organizations.While the report highlighted several areas of success among the MSD Pledge community – including tracking MSD indicators, involving frontline workers to make improvements, building greater workplace communication, and knowledge or use of MSD technology solutions – it also noted some areas of opportunity, such as improving methods of tracking MSDs, quantifying psychosocial risk factors, continually monitoring and assessing physical risk factors, sharing best practices outside of an organization, and understanding the workforce's unique needs. In addition, the report outlined several steps and actions organizations should take to achieve impactful MSD programs, including:Engaging senior leadership, designating an MSD solutions champion to represent the workforce, and creating and empowering an MSD solutions team to collaborate throughout an organization.Collecting and responding to employee feedback regularly and measuring the progress of an MSD program and safety culture, and tracking the impact, solutions effectiveness, return on investment and year-over-year change.Identifying risk factors with involvement from frontline workers and implementing appropriate changes.Ensuring MSD solutions are equitable for all employees.The MSD Solutions Index is one of several initiatives led by NSC to achieve its goal of preventing MSDs before they start. Recently, the Council introduced the next evolution of its industry-first call-to-action to transform workplace safety, the MSD Pledge 2.0.

Starting today, developers, startups, entrepreneurs, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and nonprofit organizations, will have greater choice for running their applications and serving end users from AWS data centers located in Canada. Customers will also have access to advanced AWS technologies, including data analytics, security, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI), to drive innovation. AWS also released a new economic impact study highlighting that the company is planning to invest an estimated $17.9 billion (approximately CA $24.8 billion) in Canada through 2037 via the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region and the existing AWS Canada (Central) Region in Quebec. For more information about AWS Global Infrastructure, visit aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure.""With the launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, customers and partners across Canada now have additional infrastructure to deploy applications with greater resilience, availability, and lower latency, while enabling more customers to innovate with advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to help fuel economic development across the country,"" said Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice president of Infrastructure Services at AWS. ""AWS is committed to helping organizations of all sizes and across all industries increase agility and drive innovation. We are proud to deepen our investment by driving local job creation, building cloud skills, and creating opportunities for growth and collaboration with our local customers and AWS Partners.""""Our government is committed to positioning our domestic industries for long-term growth and sustainability. The powerful digital infrastructure being established by Amazon Web Services near Calgary, Alberta will support Canadian developers, startups, large enterprises and academic institutions in their work by enabling access to AWS’s powerful advanced cloud technologies,"" said The Hon. François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, Government of Canada.

Nate Glubish, Minister of Technology and Innovation for the Government of Alberta. ""The establishment of an Amazon Web Services infrastructure Region near Calgary further strengthens our information technology sector and supports businesses and public sector organizations while helping to attract the best-in-class talent.""With the launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, AWS has 105 Availability Zones across 33 geographic regions, with announced plans to launch 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. The AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region consists of three Availability Zones and joins the existing AWS Canada (Central) Region, which opened in December 2016. AWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. Availability Zones are located far enough from each other to support customers’ business continuity, but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected through redundant, ultra-low-latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance.With the launch of the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, AWS becomes the first major cloud services provider to have an infrastructure region in Western Canada. The launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region provides customers with more options to run workloads with even greater resilience and availability, and to securely store data in Canada, while providing even lower latency across the country to drive greater productivity, more efficient business operations, and enhanced real-time application performance. Customers can now use the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, in addition to the AWS Canada (Central) Region, for use cases such as disaster recovery and can run their mission-critical applications across multiple AWS Regions in Canada with even higher levels of resilience and availability. Customers also have access to advanced AWS technologies to accelerate innovation, including compute, storage, networking, business applications, developer tools, data analytics, security, ML, and AI. As part of its infrastructure across the country, AWS has launched eight total Amazon CloudFront locations in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Amazon CloudFront is a highly secure and programmable content delivery network (CDN) that accelerates the delivery of data, videos, applications, and APIs to users worldwide, with low latency and high transfer speeds. In addition, AWS has announced AWS Local Zones in Toronto and Vancouver. AWS Local Zones are a type of AWS infrastructure deployment that places compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to customers for applications that require single-digit millisecond latency to end users.AWS also released an economic impact study estimating the company’s projected spending on the construction and operation of its two AWS infrastructure Regions in Canada will support an average of more than 9,300 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs at external businesses annually, with a planned investment of more than $17.9 billion (approx. CA $24.8 billion) through 2037. The new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, specifically, is estimated to support an average of more than 1,300 FTE jobs annually, and AWS plans to invest more than $2.9 billion (approx. CA $4 billion) in Alberta through 2037. These jobs, including construction, facility maintenance, engineering, telecommunications, and others within the country’s broader economy, will be part of the AWS supply chain in Canada. In addition, the construction and operation of the two AWS infrastructure Regions is estimated to generate more than $31 billion (approx. CA $43.02 billion) in gross domestic product (GDP), and the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region is estimated to add about $4.1 billion (CA $5.62 billion) to Canada’s GDP through 2037.Customers and AWS Partners welcome the AWS Canada West (Calgary) RegionTens of thousands of Canadian organizations are among the millions of active customers using AWS around the world. Large and small enterprises in Canada choose AWS to innovate, drive cost efficiencies, and accelerate time to market.

Public sector organizations that use AWS to transform the services delivered to Canadians include AlayaCare, the College of Physicians and Surgeons Alberta (CPSA), Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, WELL Health, and several groups within the Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces.Bell Canada, a leading Canadian technology services and digital media company, is leveraging AWS capabilities to develop and scale innovative apps and to revolutionize how subscribers engage with its services and content. ""Bell’s purpose is to advance how Canadians connect with each other and the world,"" said Petri Lyytikainen, VP of Enterprise Architecture, Cloud and Data Platforms at Bell Canada. ""This collaboration reinforces our commitment to business resilience and fosters next-generation service innovations for both consumer and business customers across Canada.""CI Financial is a diversified global asset and wealth management corporation operating primarily in Canada, Australia, and the United States. The company manages and advises on approximately $420.7 billion in client assets. ""We moved to AWS to improve our customer service, optimize business performance, and promote company-wide growth through the acquisition of new clients,"" said Ravi Kishore, director, Cloud Platform Engineering & Operations, CI Financial. ""With our strategic business applications now running on AWS, we’re developing new products faster than before, and leveraging our data to drive business decisions – continuously adapting to our customers’ evolving needs and enhancing their experience.

KOHO’s core business applications were born on AWS, and the company uses AWS’s AI and machine learning services in several areas of its operations. ""The new AWS Region near Calgary will deliver several benefits for our business, including having a failover region in-country so we can provide improved resiliency and reduced latency to our users,"" said Jonathan Klein, chief technology officer, KOHO.The National Hockey League is the premiere hockey league in the world and has been using AWS as its official cloud infrastructure provider to help analyze the details of the game for hockey fans, teams, and media partners. The NHL uses AWS artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more for its advanced analytic derivatives, NHL EdgeIQ powered by AWS. ""AWS is an industry leader in its portfolio of cloud services, helping to enable us to bring our fans closer to the game on the ice, while giving every team, official, and media partner advanced analysis of the game faster than ever before,"" said Dave Lehanski, NHL executive vice president, Business Development and Innovation. ""With the launch of a second AWS Region in Canada, this provides us more flexibility, reliability, and security to unlock more opportunities to engage our fans across Canada and the world to better understand and enjoy the game.""SECURE is a leading environmental waste management and energy infrastructure company with an extensive network of waste processing facilities, landfills, metal recycling facilities, fluid management facilities, gathering pipelines, and terminals in Western Canada and the United States. ""We’ve been working with AWS since 2021 to evaluate how SECURE uses analytics to provide a best-in-class customer experience, while solving challenges our industry faces every day,"" said Marvin Wong, vice president, Business Intelligence, Technology and Security at SECURE. ""Leveraging AWS artificial intelligence and machine learning services like Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Forecast allows us to reduce time required to turn imagining into reality. In turn, SECURE and our customers can approach complex problems with agility to improve efficiency, sustainability, and provide solutions to optimize waste management. The data residency and lower latency provided by the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region will allow SECURE to further our use of real-time data, helping us and our customers continue to challenge what is possible to create a more connected and efficient industry.""STEMCELL Technologies is Canada’s largest biotech company, which manufactures and distributes more than 2,500 scientific products to labs globally. STEMCELL relies on AWS to scale its operations, optimize costs, and increase the speed of innovation to better serve its life science customers. ""Technology is at the core of our company’s ongoing digital transformation and long-term growth,"" said John Lilleyman, chief information officer at STEMCELL. ""We moved to AWS in 2010 to help us focus our efforts on supporting science at a hyperscale level. As a result, teams spent less time on infrastructure and maintenance, and more time on innovating.

Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge and became its first signatory in 2019. As part of its Climate Pledge commitment, Amazon is on a path to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the original 2030 target. See Amazon's public methodology for more on its approach. In 2022, Amazon set a new corporate record for the most renewable energy announced by a single company in one year and remains the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy—a position it’s held since 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Amazon now has 479 renewable energy projects in 26 countries. Additionally, AWS will be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations.With a total of four renewable energy projects in Canada, Amazon is currently the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the country, according to Bloomberg NEF. Once operational, the projects will generate more than 2.3 million megawatt hours (MWH) of clean energy – enough to power 1.69 million Canadian homes. Amazon recently announced its first wind farm in Vulcan County, Alberta, and has previously invested in two solar farms, as well as a rooftop solar energy project at an Amazon delivery station in Nisku, Alberta. Amazon’s solar and wind projects are also helping benefit the local economy in Canada. New economic data from Amazon shows the company’s investments in utility-scale renewable energy projects generated an estimated CA $478 million in local economic investment, and contributed CA $206 million in total gross domestic product (GDP) from 2014 through 2022. These projects will contribute to powering Amazon’s global infrastructure.

As of December 31, 2023, we have completed the data center initiatives and the employee layoffs, and substantially completed the facilities consolidation initiatives.A summary of our restructuring charges, including subsequent adjustments, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):Three Months Ended December 31, 2023Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023Facilities ConsolidationSeverance and Other PersonnelCosts Data Center Assets Total Facilities ConsolidationSeverance and Other Personnel Costs Data CenterAssets Total Cost of revenue$                 86$              —$                7$              93$               177$               —$          (224)$             (47)Research and development71028—7381,581413—1,994Marketing and sales16216—178396307—703General and administrative     142(3)—139352450—802Total$            1,100$              41$                7$         1,148$            2,506$          1,170$          (224)$         3,452During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded total restructuring charges of $4.20 billion and $4.61 billion, respectively.CFO Outlook CommentaryWe expect first quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $34.5-37 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $94-99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. We continue to expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024:First, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs this year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint.Second, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we work down our current hiring underrun and add incremental talent to support priority areas in 2024, which we expect will further shift our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles. Finally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $30-37 billion, a $2 billion increase of the high end of our prior range. We expect growth will be driven by investments in servers, including both AI and non-AI hardware, and data centers as we ramp up construction on sites with our previously announced new data center architecture. Our updated outlook reflects our evolving understanding of our artificial intelligence (AI) capacity demands as we anticipate what we may need for the next generations of foundational research and product development. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect our ambitious long-term AI research and product development efforts will require growing infrastructure investments beyond this year.Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.In addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. Of note, the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to substantially modify our existing consent order and impose additional restrictions on our ability to operate. We are contesting this matter, but if we are unsuccessful it would have an adverse impact on our business.This was a pivotal year for our company. We increased our operating discipline, delivered strong execution across our product priorities, and improved advertising performance for the businesses who rely on our services. We will look to build on our progress in each of those areas in 2024 while advancing our ambitious, longer-term efforts in AI and Reality Labs.Webcast and Conference Call InformationMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 1:30 p.m. PT / 4:30 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 26, 2023, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is February 1, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:Foreign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.For more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results"" table in this press release.META PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

A substantial majority of the employees impacted by the layoffs are no longer included in our reported headcount as of September 30, 2023.RestructuringBeginning in 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. As of September 30, 2023, we have substantially completed planned employee layoffs while continuing to assess facilities consolidation and data center restructuring initiatives.A summary of our restructuring charges, including subsequent adjustments, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):Three Months Ended September 30, 2023Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023Facilities ConsolidationSeverance and Other Personnel CostsData Center AssetsTotalFacilities ConsolidationSeverance and Other Personnel CostsData Center AssetsTotalCost of revenue$           25$          —$        (12)$          13$           92$          —$      (232)$     (140)Research and development     228(70)—158871385—1,256Marketing and sales5469—123233290—523General and administrative4541—86210454—664Total$         352$          40$        (12)$        380$      1,406$     1,129$      (232)$    2,303During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded total restructuring charges of $305 million and $1.94 billion under our FoA segment, respectively, and $75 million and $360 million under our RL segment, respectively.CFO Outlook Commentary We expect fourth quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5-40 billion. Our guidance assumes a foreign currency tailwind of approximately 2% to year-over-year total revenue growth in the fourth quarter, based on current exchange rates.We anticipate that our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $87-89 billion, lowered from our prior range of $88-91 billion. This outlook includes approximately $3.5 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. We expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023.We are also sharing a preliminary outlook for 2024 expenses, capital expenditures and our tax rate. We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $94-99 billion. We continue to expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024:First, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs next year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint.Second, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we work down our current hiring underrun and add incremental talent to support priority areas in 2024, which we expect will continue to shift our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles.Finally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.We expect 2023 capital expenditures to be in the range of $27-29 billion, updated from our prior estimate of $27-30 billion.We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $30-35 billion, with growth driven by investments in servers, including both non-artificial intelligence (AI) and AI hardware, and data centers as we ramp up construction on sites with the new data center architecture we announced late last year.Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our fourth quarter 2023 and full-year 2024 tax rates to be similar to the third quarter of 2023.Please note that our outlook for 2024 expenses, capital expenditures and tax rate are preliminary estimates. In the future, we expect to provide our initial forward year expense, capital expenditures and tax rate outlooks on the fourth quarter call.In addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. Of note, the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to substantially modify our existing consent order and impose additional restrictions on our ability to operate. We are contesting this matter, but if we are unsuccessful it would have an adverse impact on our business.Webcast and Conference Call InformationMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on July 27, 2023, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October 25, 2023, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:Foreign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.For more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results"" table in this press release.META PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

Node is the first truly customer-focused solution, making transacting easier and more secure for both merchants and their customers. Today, Node invites merchants to apply to its exclusive beta program for white glove onboarding and early-access benefits to its patent-pending technology.""Online shopping has had difficulty finding a balance between ease of use and safety. Asking customers to remember usernames and passwords that have to be stored on vendors' servers generates a potentially unsafe situation. There are many companies devoted to tackling the range of issues, such as password retrieval, form completion, risk evaluation, and more,"" says Rohan Mahadevan, CEO at Node. ""We must change the system to eradicate the symptoms. Node requires no usernames and stores no personal information. It's a whole new way to manage online transactions.""Ubiquitous Personal Computing & Advanced Cryptography Make it PossibleEarly ecommerce launched when most people shared computers, requiring usernames and passwords to authenticate identity. These days, most shoppers have a smartphone handy when they are looking to make a purchase, and these devices have far more computing power and memory than the computers of the past.Early online stores required servers to house all the personal and product information required, plus significant maintenance and management to keep them current. Over the past 3-5 years, a monumental shift in cryptography allows both businesses and individuals to trust information that doesn't sit on their server.That new level of online trust, when combined with the ubiquity of powerful personal computing, makes Node possible - and eliminates the need for usernames and passwords.Backed by Big Players in Shopping & PaymentsNode is introducing an ecosystem-level change, attracting investors who are each experts in key elements of online shopping, from platform development to customer acquisition, payments, risk management, security, and more. Node's $2.75M seed investment was led by Neotribe Ventures, and also includes executives and founders from across current ecosystem leaders, including Bill Me Later (acq: NASDAQ: PYPL), Boku, Citicards, Facebook, Magento (acq:NASDAQ: ADBE), Meta (NASDAQ: META), and PayPal. Funds will support product development and go-to-market.""Anyone involved behind-the-scenes in ecommerce knows how overdue we are for true transformation,"" said Kittu Kolluri, founder of Neotribe Ventures. ""Rohan and the veteran team behind Node are uniquely qualified to spearhead this change because they know the pain points and challenges merchants face - from delivering a good user experience to managing risk analysis. There's been a whole industry built around plugging gaps or smoothing friction in a system that no longer serves merchants OR consumers. Time for something new.""Why Merchants Will Benefit from the BetaFor decades, merchants have had to choose between introducing hassle to shoppers (username/password, CAPTCHA, etc.) and consistent connection that creates loyal customers. Node provides both, while removing all the data privacy and storage headaches, offering:Premium guest experience: Guests receive a better experience than today's account-holders, with a ""one-click"" repeat user experience similar to Amazon.Easy integration & lower costs: Node works with existing infrastructure, and will be easily adapted for future product developments. It eliminates all unnecessary infrastructure, experience and data privacy costs associated with accounts.Always up-to-date: All consumer information remains current - removing the frustration of dated or expired information.Top-of-line security: Node eliminates transaction risks, fake accounts and sign-ups, updating payment information, password recovery and more. It offers instant compliance with GDPR, CCPA, PCI, and data localization.And because of its consumer-centric structure, Node delivers happy shoppers who can transact easily and safely. Every merchant's dream!Interested merchants can apply for the beta program to receive founder-led white glove service and consideration to be featured in launch materials prior to the 2024 holiday shopping season. Selections will be communicated directly to applicants.About NodeNode is an ecommerce app that puts customers at the center of the transaction with full control over their information on any site and all within one app. The app represents a fundamental paradigm shift in commerce that brings merchants and consumers a new way to transact and interact. By modernizing and streamlining the e-commerce experience, Node provides a more secure way for consumers to purchase and for merchants to reimagine how they engage with customers.To learn more about Node, please visit https://www.nodemy.info/.Media ContactMartha Shaughnessy, Node, 415-987-0285, node@thekeypr.com, https://www.nodemy.info/View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prweb.com/releases/payments-leaders-recreate-commerce-centering-the-consumer-meet-node-301965891.htmlSOURCE NodeTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesHere's what could happen next to Nvidia shares.Tesla delivers a hard-nosed message to employees.Robert Kiyosaki, the author renowned for his best-selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” has again captured the public’s attention with his unconventional financial strategies, this time revealing a staggering $1.2 billion in debt.

Free cash flow was $10.96 billion in the second quarter of 2023.Long-term debt – Long-term debt was $18.38 billion as of June 30, 2023.Headcount – Headcount was 71,469 as of June 30, 2023, a decrease of 14% year-over-year. Approximately half of the employees impacted by the 2023 layoffs are included in our reported headcount as of June 30, 2023.RestructuringBeginning in 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. As of June 30, 2023, we have substantially completed planned employee layoffs while continuing to assess facilities consolidation and data center restructuring initiatives.A summary of our restructuring charges, including subsequent adjustments, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):Three Months Ended June 30, 2023Six Months Ended June 30, 2023FacilitiesConsolidationSeveranceand OtherPersonnelCostsData CenterAssetsTotalFacilitiesConsolidationSeveranceand OtherPersonnelCostsData CenterAssetsTotalCost of revenue$                   9$           —$            (51)$        (42)$                 67$           —$         (220)$     (153)Research and development159136—295643455—1,098Marketing and sales43218—261180222—402General and administrative36230—266164413—577Total$               247$        584$            (51)$        780$            1,054$     1,090$         (220)$    1,924During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded total restructuring charges of $705 million and $1.64 billion under our FoA segment, respectively, and $75 million and $286 million under our RL segment, respectively. These charges lowered our operating margin by two percentage points and three percentage points for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and our diluted EPS by $0.25 and $0.61 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.CFO Outlook Commentary We expect third quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $32-34.5 billion. Our guidance assumes a foreign currency tailwind of approximately 3% to year-over-year total revenue growth in the third quarter, based on current exchange rates.We anticipate our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $88-91 billion, increased from our prior range of $86-90 billion due to legal-related expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2023. This outlook includes approximately $4 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. We expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023.While we are not providing a quantitative outlook beyond 2023 at this point, we expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024 as we continue to invest in our most compelling opportunities, including artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse.First, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs next year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint.Second, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we evolve our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles.Finally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and investments to further scale our ecosystem.We expect our full-year 2023 capital expenditures to be in the range of $27-30 billion, lowered from our prior estimate of $30-33 billion. The reduced forecast is due to both cost savings, particularly on non-AI servers, as well as shifts in capital expenditures into 2024 from delays in projects and equipment deliveries rather than a reduction in overall investment plans.Looking ahead, while we will continue to refine our plans as we progress throughout this year, we currently expect total capital expenditures to grow in 2024, driven by our investments across both data centers and servers, particularly in support of our AI work.Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect the tax rate for the rest of the year to be similar to the second quarter of 2023.In addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape. With respect to EU-U.S. data transfers, we saw a positive development with the European Commission's adoption of a final adequacy decision, which allows us to continue to provide our services in Europe. This is good news, though broadly speaking, we continue to see increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.Webcast and Conference Call InformationMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 27, 2023, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is July 26, 2023, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:Foreign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.For more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results"" table in this press release.META PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per share amounts)(Unaudited)Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,2023202220232022Revenue$           31,999$           28,822$            60,645$            56,729Costs and expenses:Cost of revenue5,9455,19212,05411,197Research and development9,3448,69018,72516,397Marketing and sales3,1543,5956,1986,907General and administrative (1)4,1642,9877,0495,347Total costs and expenses22,60720,46444,02639,848Income from operations9,3928,35816,61916,881Interest and other income (expense), net(99)(172)(19)213Income before provision for income taxes9,2938,18616,60017,094Provision for income taxes1,5051,4993,1022,942Net income$              7,788$              6,687$            13,498$            14,152Earnings per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stockholders:Basic$                3.03$                2.47$                5.24$                5.21Diluted$                2.98$                2.46$                5.18$                5.19Weighted-average shares used to compute earnings per share attributable to Class Aand Class B common stockholders:Basic2,5682,7042,5772,714Diluted2,6122,7132,6042,729(1)The second quarter 2023 general and administrative expenses include accrued legal expenses of $1.87 billion, which mostly relate to the fine imposed by the Irish Data Protection Commission in the ongoing data transfers matter and the adoption of new fining guidelines by the European Data Protection Board.

Despite their enormous footprint, however, these structures are designed with the respect of our land, our communities, and our people in mind by incorporating design and construction strategies that conserve energy and water, eliminate waste, and responsibly source materials. The result: Our facilities are LEED Gold certified and supported by 100 percent renewable energy.To drive innovation and efficiency beyond these high standards, our team has multiple pilot programs in various stages of pursuit and delivery. They vary from experimenting with low-carbon concrete and tracking the circular economy of materials, to testing the feasibility of an all-electric construction vehicle fleet and sourcing alternative fuel sources. Yet they are united by one goal: to create future data centers on the cutting edge of performance and sustainability.A successful pilot means not only securing buy-in from internal stakeholders, along with funding and manpower, but also mapping a path to applicability and scalability across the enterprise. When it comes to determining whether a pilot is viable, our team begins with a five-factor framework:Impact: What is the impact of this strategy?Application: What is the universality of the pilot?Engagement: How will we communicate, with various stakeholders, a message that will most resonate?Prioritization: Where will this fall in the line of current and future projects/initiatives?Funding: What is the cost (money, time, effort, education/training) to implement?These questions help us shape each pilot and support higher-level focuses, such as reducing Meta's carbon footprint. When Meta's Net Zero program was in its infancy, for example, we strategized pilots to test new technologies and approaches to track the impacts of material composition in our mechanical, electrical and plumbing equipment; our facilities' operational waste; and potential of alternative fuel types.In 2021, we proposed HVO (hydrogenated vegetable oil) as a carbon-saving alternative to diesel for construction equipment at one of our European facilities. The site had regional availability of the fuel type, plus the application and contractor partner were deemed a good fit. Ultimately, timing and cost made the pilot too challenging to pursue. Fortunately, our team's extensive analysis on HVO provided the solid promise for a future opportunity with a greater understanding of a successful pilot proposal and further refinement of stakeholder engagement, as well as a new Risk Registry tool to identify potential risks in a project that can derail intended outcomes.Today, those lessons have shaped an exciting pilot to test low-carbon concrete, the primary contributor to emissions from data center construction (and 8 percent of global emissions overall). Our pilot leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and test low-carbon concrete mixes and, ultimately, resulted in use at scale in our data center in DeKalb, Illinois, in 2022. In a partnership with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, we utilized AI to find a sustainable concrete mix with 40 percent lower carbon emissions. The team worked closely with our concrete trade partner, Ozinga, on test applications in non-critical areas to meet a combined goal of both low-carbon and long-term strength requirements.It's true that the carbon footprint during the data center construction phase can often be overlooked. To offset this, we work with our general contractors to communicate ways to reduce (and eliminate) the barriers to going green on a typical job site. Meta's general contractors now implement technologies and processes for more efficient builds, linking to carbon reductions with partners and circularity in our materials. At our Altoona, Iowa, site, we are upscaling onsite tracking to include both construction and operational waste (as well as using hybrid-fuel construction equipment). It's just one combination leading our builds to greater, sustainable impact.Thanks to our robust and vetted piloting program, along with engaged stakeholders, we are able to build with successful social and environmental impacts while providing opportunities to integrate new technologies and strategies across our portfolio. We minimize risks across our facilities by testing ideas - whether a change in design or construction, or even a process - and gain wider acceptance before rolling it out for wide-scale application.And thus, our work toward greater performance and sustainability continues to build.This article series is sponsored by Meta.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Meta on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MetaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/metaEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: MetaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/752139/How-To-Grow-a-Sustainability-Pilot-Into-Reality-at-ScaleTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsRelated QuotesHere's what could happen next to Nvidia shares.Tesla delivers a hard-nosed message to employees.Robert Kiyosaki, the author renowned for his best-selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” has again captured the public’s attention with his unconventional financial strategies, this time revealing a staggering $1.2 billion in debt.

In connection with these layoffs, we expect to incur total pre-tax severance and related personnel costs of approximately $1 billion, of which $523 million was recognized during the first quarter of 2023 and the remaining charges will be substantially recorded by the end of 2023.A summary of our restructuring charges for the three months ended March 31, 2023 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):Three Months Ended March 31, 2023Severance and Other Personnel Costs (1)Facilities ConsolidationData Center Assets (2)TotalCost of revenue$                       —$                       58$                  (168)$                  (110)Research and development320484—804Marketing and sales3136—139General and administrative182129—$                    311Total$                    505$                    807$                  (168)$                 1,144____________________________(1)Includes severance and personnel costs of $523 million related to the 2023 layoffs and $18 million reduction in severance estimates related to the 2022 layoff.(2)Relates to a change in estimates in our data center restructuring charges recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2022.Total restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $934 million and RL segment were $210 million during the first quarter of 2023. Excluding these charges, our operating margin would have been four percentage points higher and our diluted EPS would have been $0.44 higher for the first quarter of 2023.CFO Outlook Commentary We expect second quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $29.5-32 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency headwinds will be less than 1% to year-over-year total revenue growth in the second quarter, based on current exchange rates.We anticipate our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $86-90 billion, updated from our prior outlook provided in March. This outlook includes $3-5 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. We continue to expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023.We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $30-33 billion, unchanged from our prior estimate. This outlook reflects our ongoing build out of AI capacity to support ads, Feed and Reels, along with an increased investment in capacity for our generative AI initiatives.Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2023 tax rate percentage to be around 20%.In addition, we continue to monitor ongoing regulatory developments. We expect the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) to issue a decision in May in its previously disclosed inquiry relating to transatlantic data transfers of Facebook EU/EEA user data, including a suspension order for such transfers and a fine. Our ongoing consultations with policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic continue to indicate that the proposed new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework will be fully implemented before the deadline for suspension of such transfers, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it will not be completed in time. We will also evaluate whether and to what extent the IDPC decision could otherwise impact our data processing operations even after a new data privacy framework is in force.Webcast and Conference Call InformationMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments (including the impact of the pending decision by the IDPC and the pending EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework); risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 2, 2023, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is April 26, 2023, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:Foreign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.For more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results"" table in this press release. META PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per
